0,1988-03-29,"-- under alternative a , federal funds would be expected to trade around the current 6 percent discount rate ; this could be accomplished by reducing the discount rate by 1/2 point while keeping the $ 200 million borrowing objective , or by decreasing this objective .
 under alternative a , the easing of reserve market condi- tions would ripple through other financial markets .
 the 3-month treasury bill would drop to below 5 - 1/2 percent , but declines in longer - term rates might be small .
 absent a weaker economic picture than contemplated under the staff forecast , market participants may not expect such a policy easing to be sustained for long .
 the dollar could come under substantial downward pressures , particularly if concerns about inflation and external adjustment increased .
 with the lower short - term market interest rates of alternative a , m2 growth would not be expected to moderate much over the next three months .
 expansion of this aggregate , at an 8 percent rate from march to june , would leave m2 only a little below the upper end of its annual target cone .
 opportunity costs of holding retail deposits within m2 would continue the declines begun last fall .
 inflows into small time deposits might abate as their rates completed their downward adjustment , but growth of nows , savings deposits and mmdas could pick up noticeably .
 with some boost to required compensating demand balances of businesses also coming from lower market rates , m1 might well grow at a 6 percent annual rate from march to june .
 m3 would be strengthened somewhat less than the other aggregates over the three months , as lower market interest rates shift some credit demands to nonbank sources in light of lagging bank lending rates , but this aggregate would still record a 7 percent increase from march to june .
 directive language",0," with recent conditions in the reserves market maintained under alternative b , interest rates would tend to remain around current levels , at least for a time .
 but given the staff economic forecast , which implies a flow of data that would not allay market concerns about potentially inflationary pressures on resources , the market might well remain edgy .
 in addition , if signs of further expansion in domestic demand were combined with trade data suggesting sluggish adjustment of u.s . external imbalances , the dollar could come under further downward pressure which , in this context , would be likely to contribute to some increases in u.s . interest rates .
 given the financial conditions associated with alternative b , m2 and m3 are expected to grow at 7 and 6 - 1/2 percent annual rates , respectively , from march to june , leaving them well into the upper halves of their 4 to 8 percent annual ranges .
 although the broader aggregates would be expected to slow somewhat from the pace of the last three months , growth would still exceed the projected expansion of nominal income .
 an important impetus to growth of m2 will continue to be the reduced oppor- tunity cost of holding retail interest - bearing accounts .
 to be sure , opportunity costs are likely to widen a little once again in coming months as returns on retail balances edge off further in lagged response to the 2 . on a quarterly average basis the growth rates of m2 and m3 would increase somewhat in the second quarter ; this pattern primarily reflects the damping effects on the first quarter growth of the weakness in money growth late in 1987 .
 the velocities of m2 and m3 would be expected to decline in the second quarter by 2 - 1/2 and 1 - 1/2 percentage points , respectively , somewhat more than seems in train in the first quarter .
 previous decline in market rates .
 nevertheless , the expected second - quar- ter spread between market rates and the average return on retail balances in m2 still would represent a very substantial reduction from its peak in the third quarter of last year .
 inflows to these accounts might be sup- ported by other influences as well : the personal saving rate is projected to remain high relative to last year , and additions to iras should be considerably smaller than in recent years in response to tightened tax- reform restrictions .
 m1 growth in april might be boosted by a buildup in trans- action balances associated with tax payments , which are projected to exceed the typical volume reflected in the transactions account seasonals , though not matching last year 's exceptional surge .
 any such effect will have at a rate of about 4 - 1/2 percent under alternative b . demand deposits are anticipated to strengthen only a little on balance over the next three months , after the somewhat inexplicable weakness through the first quarter .
 now account growth , while moderating from recent rapid rates , would remain above the pace of the second half of 1987 .
 m1 velocity would continue to increase , but at a slower rate than in the first quarter .",0,"-- under alternative c , the borrowing objective would be raised to $ 400 million and the funds rate would move up to the vicinity of 7 percent .
 the more restrictive monetary posture of alternative c , at least at this time , would come as some surprise to financial markets .
 with the funds rate averaging around 7 percent , the 3-month treasury bill rate could move into an area around 6 - 1/4 percent .
 rate spreads between bank and thrift paper and treasury bills could widen , if concerns about their asset quality and earnings prospects intensify , which might be more likely , given the already troubled status of many depository institutions .
 a good portion of the increases in short - term rates might show through in longer- term rates .
 but , an upward movement in u.s . interest rates , especially if viewed as reflecting federal reserve resolve to avoid inflation and faster external adjustment by containing domestic demand , would help to support 3 .
 a special adjustment was made to prevent last year 's tax payments from distorting demand deposit seasonal factors .
 the dollar in the near term , and over time the net increase in bond yields could be limited .
 the broader monetary aggregates under alternative c would post a more marked slowing over the course of the quarter than under the other alternatives , as the effects of the rebound in market interest rates increasingly took hold .
 both aggregates would end the quarter a bit closer to , though still above , the midpoints of their longer - run ranges .
 the attractiveness of transactions and other liquid accounts would be lessened further , as their rates lag in typical fashion behind market yields .
 m1 probably would be growing very sluggishly by june , leaving its growth from the fourth quarter to june a bit below its current 4 percent rate through march .",0.5,,,0.25
1,1988-05-17," such a measure on the heels of the two recent tightening steps clearly would be unexpected by market participants and , in the absence of considerably weaker economic and price data , might raise doubts about the federal reserve 's anti - inflationary resolve .
 the exchange value of the dollar would come under strong downward pressure , and there is some risk that heightened inflationary expectations would have adverse implications for bond prices .
 the prospect that such a policy easing could not long be sustained also would limit associated declines in short - term interest rates , with the three - month treasury bill rate perhaps not falling much below 6 percent .
 this decline in money market rates would encourage somewhat faster growth in the broader monetary aggregates , although the march - to - june growth of m2 and m3 still would remain well below their december - to - march pace , and in june these aggre- gates still would be below the upper limit of their 4 to 8 percent long - run ranges .
 directive language",-0.5," the table below gives growth rates for the monetary aggre- gates from march to june expected to be associated with the reserve market conditions for each alternative .
 under all the alternatives , m2 growth should be appreciably slower on average over may and june compared with its advanced april pace , reflecting the effects of higher interest rates and the unwinding of the tax - related build - up .
 under alternative b , the effects on money demand for the march - to - june period of somewhat higher interest rates than anticipated at the last fomc meeting are offset by upward revisions to income , and the growth rates of m2 and m3 , respectively , are projected to be 2 .
 the intermeeting consultation range for the federal funds rate suggested for alternative b in the table below is 5 to 9 percent , up from 4 to 8 percent at present , in order to be better centered on expected federal funds rates .
 at the upper end and in the middle of the committee 's current 6 to 7 percent short - run specifications .
 the detailed table and charts on the following pages indicate that the broad aggregates would be expected under all the alternatives to remain within the upper halves of their annual target cones through midyear .
 c growth from march to june m2 7 - 3/4 7
 6 - 1/4 m3 6 - 3/4 6 - 1/2 6 - 1/4 m1 6 - 1/2
 5 - 1/2 4 - 1/2 associated federal funds rate range 4 to 8 5 to 9 5 to 9
 market interest rates now appear to incorporate the policy stance of alternative b . thus , with federal funds continuing to trade around 7 percent , the three - month treasury bill rate could remain in the 6 - 1/4 percent area in the near term .
 but if economic data in coming weeks confirm the second - quarter strength of economic activity envisioned in the greenbook forecast , heightened market concern about inflation and anticipa- tion of further policy restraint could well induce a further firming in short- and long - term rates as midyear approaches .
 pressures on the dollar will depend not only on incoming information about the trade deficit and on movements in relative interest rates , but also on market views of how macro- economic developments and policies are affecting the sustainability of improvements in external imbalances .

 under alternative b , opportunity costs of holding liquid retail accounts would remain higher through midyear than in recent months , given the likely very gradual response of offering rates on such accounts to the recent rise in market rates .
 the unwinding of tax - related balances also have considerably smaller impacts on m2 than on m1 .
 the latter was boosted more substantially in april by the temporary build - up of transactions depos- its and will be more affected by the rise in interest rates as depositors shift funds from ocds into small time deposits , whose yields adjust more promptly to market rates .
 growth in m1 is projected to drop below 3 percent on average over may and june from 11 - 1/4 percent in april .
 in light of weakness early in may , probably related to clearing of tax checks , m2 is projected to increase at only a 4 - 1/2 percent rate this month .
 in june , m2 expansion is expected to rebound to around 6 - 1/2 percent -- a little below the projected growth of nominal income over the current quarter , owing to higher opportunity costs .
 implied m2 growth from march to june would be held to 7 percent , but , with the rapid m2 expansion through april , quarterly average growth would amount to around 8 percent . assuming the staff projection of second - quarter growth in nominal gnp of around 7 percent , m2 velocity would fall by about 1 percent , approximately half of the decline in the first quarter .
 m3 growth should moderate to around a 6 - 1/4 percent rate over may and june under alternative b . money market mutual funds in m3 probably will decline further for a while as returns lag behind recently elevated short - term market rates .
 the drop in core deposit inflows in may and june is likely to be only partly offset by increased issuance of managed liabili- ties by banks and thrifts because depository institution credit is antici- pated to slow .
 at banks , business loan growth , though likely to remain strong given the rise in bond rates , should drop back from the april pace , which was boosted by an extraordinary volume of merger - related and other special borrowing , and households may tap consumer credit and home equity lines to a lesser extent in coming months with the scaling back of auto incentives and the passing of the april tax date .
 at thrifts , however , the restraining effects on asset expansion of the recent upturn in mortgage rates will be cushioned some by a growing share of arms .
 total household borrowing over the remainder of the quarter is expected to edge down , while overall business credit demands should remain robust into the summer given the elevated financing gap and continuing merger activity .
 but with federal government borrowing light over the rest of the second quarter , the growth in the debt of all domestic nonfinancial sectors by june is expected to be moving closer to , though still staying a little above , the 9 percent mid- point of the committee 's annual range .",0," the increase in discount borrowing to $ 600 million under alternative c would raise the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point and carry treasury bill rates up by similar amounts .
 banks very likely would raise the prime rate by another 1/2 point , and business financing costs on open market paper also could rise by a like amount .
 downward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would be forestalled , at least for a time .
 as is typical , bond yields would go up by less than short - term rates , though the initial declines in bond and possibly stock prices in response to an unanticipated firming of the size contemplated under this alternative could be substantial .
 over time , however , movements in securities prices will depend on perceptions both of underlying strength in credit demands and of the likely success of the federal reserve in checking any emerging accelera- tion of inflation .
 while the course of economic activity and prices would not be much affected by small variations in the time path of interest rates , alternative c is closer to what was contemplated in the staff gnp forecast , which anticipates a fairly substantial rise in money market yields through early 1989 .
-- ( 13 ) the higher market interest rates associated with alternative c would further damp money growth .",0.5,,,0.0
2,1988-08-16,,N," financial markets in recent days have largely built in a federal funds rate of around 8 - 1/8 percent , although some further adjust- ments may occur under alternative b . for example , the 3-month treasury bill rate might edge higher to around 7 - 1/8 percent as some of the remain- ing uncertainties about any further responses of capital markets in the
 and financial markets and policies abroad are resolved .
 bond yields should remain around current levels , especially if the dollar , as expected , continues fairly firm .

 in any case , the long - term treasury bond yield would tend to move higher , perhaps by 10 to 20 basis points , if the treasury receives authority to issue more of such securities .
 m2 under alternative b is expected to increase at a 3 - 3/4 percent pace over the last two months of the quarter , slightly higher than in july .
 this speedup is associated with a strengthening in overnight rps and eurodollars , already evident in recent weekly data , in part as banks rebuild their government security positions .
 the retail component of m2 should decelerate in response to wider opportunity costs .
 within m2 , liquid household deposits , which have begun to soften in early august , are expected to be relatively weak .
 small time deposit growth should quicken as the public takes advantage of the more attractive returns offered on fixed - maturity accounts , but not by enough to offset the moderation in liquid deposits .
 slower ocd growth , along with weakness in demand deposits as compensating balance requirements are scaled back , should damp m1 expansion over the next two months to an average of just under 4 percent .
 under alternative b , average m3 growth over august and september is projected to stay at its 5 - 1/2 percent july pace , despite a pickup in bank and thrift credit .
 outflows from institution - only money funds are expected to follow the recent rise in market rates , and inflows to treasury deposits will be holding down needs for managed liabilities .
 with credit at depository institutions projected to continue in the fourth quarter at around the rates of august and september , m3 could grow at close to a 6 percent rate over the balance of the year , bringing its growth for the year to around 6 - 1/2 percent .
 the debt of domestic nonfinancial sec- tors is projected to grow at around an 8 percent annual rate over the remainder of the year , placing it a little below the midpoint of its moni- toring range by year - end .",0,"-- b maintains the current $ 600 million assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing and alternative c increases intended borrowing to $ 800 million .
-- federal funds likely would trade between 8 - 1/2 and 8 - 3/4 percent under alternative c , perhaps more toward the lower end of this range if the additional firming acted to dispel expectations of still further near - term policy moves .
 the tightening of reserve positions under alternative c immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising to market participants and the associated 1/2 percentage point increase in the funds rate probably would show through nearly fully in private money market rates .
 nominal bond yields probably would rise by less .
 this action might allay market concerns about future inflation , implying that the rise in nominal interest rates would reflect at least as large an increase in real rates .
 the higher real rates would boost the dollar on foreign exchange markets , at least for a time , and the greater foreign demand for dollar assets could cushion somewhat the effects on bond and stock prices .
 with the higher interest rates of alternative c , m2 is pro- jected to record only 3 percent growth over august and september .
 the upward movement of rates would slow m2 even further in the fourth quarter , moving this aggregate appreciably below the midpoint of its annual growth range .
 growth of m3 , by contrast , would probably not be damped enough under alternative c to move below its midpoint , even by year - end .
 long- term debt issuance by businesses likely would be more restrained under alternative c , shifting some business credit demands to banks , despite a probable further increase in the prime rate .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
3,1988-09-20," under alternative a , m2 and m3 would strengthen over the august - to - december period .
 partly owing to some narrowing of opportunity costs , m2 by december would likely be growing at a rate around the 5 per- cent midpoint of its provisional range for next year , and m3 at 7 percent .
 an immediate easing would come as a surprise to market participants , given the recent policies and statements of the federal reserve and current per-
 ceptions that inflationary pressures , though perhaps less certain to mount , are not likely to moderate substantially .
 short - term market rates would drop immediately by about the full extent of the easing in the funds rate , and bond yields would also decline .
 the initial bond market response could be substantial , but if data failed to confirm some further moderation in the economy and price pressures , bond yields could retrace much of these declines , especially if downward pressure on the dollar persisted .
 directive language",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , the federal funds rate would be expected to continue to trade generally in the 8 to 8 - 1/4 percent area .
 with markets now expecting no change in policy over the near term , short - term rates likely would remain near current levels under alternative b ; the 3-month treasury bill rate should stay around 7 - 1/4 percent .
 the dollar will probably trade around recent levels for a while under this alternative especially if , as seems likely , foreign monetary policies are also unchanged over coming weeks .
 in this environment , the behavior of bond yields will depend importantly on the strength of incoming data on the long - run ranges 4 to 8 4 to 8 alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates

 if such data confirm market perceptions of moderate growth and little additional pressure on prices , these yields probably would hold at recent lower levels .
 but bond yields would retrace some of their recent declines if incoming information shows less moderation in demands and more strength in oil prices than now seems built into market expectations .
 in addition , bond yields may have been held down by a paucity of supply , which could be reversed by congressional passage of long - bond authorization for the treasury or by decisions by corporations or state and local governments to take advantage of recently reduced long - term rates .
 m2 is expected to continue to grow at a 3 percent annual rate from august to december under alternative b , with particular weakness in liquid deposits ; m1 is projected to increase at only a 1/2 percent annual rate over this period .
 although offering rates should move closer to cur- rent levels of market interest rates , growth of m1 and m2 relative to income will be restrained by the earlier widening of opportunity costs and the other factors discussed above .
 m2 velocity would rise at a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter , somewhat faster than in the current quarter , and m1 velocity at a 5 - 1/2 percent rate .
 m3 likely would continue to grow at a 5 percent rate under alternative b , and its velocity would edge up again in the fourth quarter .
 a further moderation in credit growth at thrifts , and associated funding needs , is likely to be offset by some pickup in bank credit , as lending to businesses and securities acquisitions rebound following weakness over july and august .
 total borrowing by businesses is expected to strengthen some- what over the balance of the year , reflecting larger external financing needs and substantial further share retirements , with credit demands still focused to a large extent on the short- and intermediate - term markets .
 domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to rise at a 8 - 1/2 percent rate over the last four months of the year and for the year as a whole , leaving it somewhat below the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range .",0," with markets not now expecting a near - term tightening of policy , the rise in the federal funds rate under the firmer reserve condi- tions of alternative c would be about matched by increases in other short- term rates -- perhaps including the prime rate .
 bond yields and the dollar also would back up ; the amounts would depend on surrounding circumstances , but could be considerable if market participants extrapolated a renewed tightening trend for policy in the context of incoming data suggesting continued momentum in the economy .
 foreign monetary authorities might follow suit to temper the rise in the dollar .
 the further rise in oppor- tunity costs under alternative c would likely damp m2 growth to only a 2 percent rate over the august - to - december period , and its m1 component would be expected to decline a little .
 by the end of the year , m2 would be growing at only a 1 percent rate .
 m3 growth also would slow from its pace of recent months , mainly reflecting further weakness in institution - only money market mutual funds .",0.5,,,0.0
4,1988-11-01," under alternative a , money market interest rates would decline about 1/2 percentage point , with the 3-month treasury bill drop- ping to a little below 7 percent .
 the dollar would come under sharp downward pressure , especially in view of the remote prospects for a com- parable easing of policy abroad .
 long - term interest rates would decline further but the extent of the drop might be limited by the weaker tone of the dollar and would depend in any event on market interpretations as to whether incoming data suggested a sustained easing of pressures on domestic resources and prices .
 in the absence of particularly weak economic data , the yield curve could steepen a bit .",-0.5," maintenance of current reserve conditions under alternative b is in line with market expectations about the near - term course of policy , and as a consequence any changes in interest rates and dollar exchange rates are likely to be relatively small .
 the federal funds rate under the borrowing specifications of this alternative would be expected to remain mostly in an 8 to 8 - 1/4 percent range .
 while con- tinuation of the recent firmness can not be ruled out , the funds rate may move a little lower in this range as the effects of the temporary fac- tors that appear to have reduced demands for borrowed reserves wear off .
 in this case , other short - term rates would edge down as well .
 however , very short - term rates could firm a bit in december as banks and other borrowers position themselves in anticipation of year - end pressures ; some year - end pressures have already began to show through in short - term rates , though far less than last year .
 while rates already have ad- justed to an extent to anticipated buyouts , further temporary effects may accompany the financial flows associated with the actual transac- tions .
 cd and commercial paper issuance should balloon , possibly putting some upward pressure on private short - term rates , and substan- tial new supplies of low - grade corporate bonds also may be forthcoming .
 in the treasury market , some increases in bond rates could occur if the treasury were to announce a larger - than - usual offering on the mid- quarter refunding to take advantage of the shortage of bonds created by the absence of a long bond at the previous refunding as well as by skimpy offerings of investment - grade corporate bonds .
 under alternative b , m2 growth would strengthen modest- ly -- to a 3 percent rate -- from the 1 - 1/4 percent pace of september and october , largely reflecting some turnaround in overnight rps and eurodollars .
 in addition , growth in retail accounts in m2 would firm a little ; the damping influence of earlier increases in market interest rates should diminish , in part as opportunity costs edge down with rising deposit offering rates .
 m1 would be expected to be about un- changed over november and december as demand deposits and ocds continue to run off through year - end .
 on a quarterly average basis , m1 would be about flat in the fourth quarter and growth in its velocity would strengthen to a 6 - 1/2 percent rate given the staff gnp forecast .
 m2 would grow at only a 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter on this basis , implying a 4 - 1/2 percent rate of increase in its velocity .
 such an increase in velocity is a little larger than implied by the staff models of m2 demand , which show the rise in interest rates from earlier this year damping m2 growth in the fourth quarter by about 3 - 1/2 percent , but within their usual margin of error .
 under this alternative , m2 would enter the year at around the lower end of its provisional range for 1989 , and absent a significant subsequent change in policy , would strengthen only gradually next year , remaining well down in its range for some time .
 m3 growth is expected to pick up to a 6 - 1/2 percent rate over november and december under alternative b , implying quarterly average growth of 4 - 1/2 percent in the current quarter and a further rise in its velocity -- at a 2 percent rate .
 under this alternative , m3 would begin the year in the upper half of its tentative range .
 however , m3 growth might weaken a bit in the early part of 1989 as bank loans to finance buyouts were repaid or sold to other investors .
 and , in general , trend growth in bank and thrift credit should remain damped in response to capital requirements and regulatory pressures .",0," with little anticipation of a near - term tightening of policy remaining in the market , short - term interest rates would climb about 1/2 percentage point under alternative c .
 the dollar probably would reverse some of its recent decline , and long - term interest rates also would rise .
 the extent of this rise could be relatively small if the tightening of policy were interpreted as damping activity and reduc- ing inflationary risks in an economy that was already seen to be experiencing more moderate growth .
 under alternative c , m2 would expand at only a 2 percent rate over the remainder of the year .
 this aggregate would be well below the lower end of its provisional range at the beginning of 1989 and given the lagged effect of the change in interest rates , growth would remain quite damped for a while .
 wider opportunity costs would reduce inflows to retail accounts , and m1 balances would contract .
 m3 still would continue to strengthen under this alternative -- the pickup , though , being limited by rate - induced outflows from money funds -- and enter 1989 well within its tentative range .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
5,1989-03-28," with the lower money market rates of alternative a , m2 growth would strengthen to a 4 percent pace , lifting it above the lower bound of its growth cone by june .
 m3 would move more into the middle portion of its range .
 the decline in other short - term market rates might be less than the one - half point drop in the federal funds rate , depending on per- ceptions of the sustainability of the policy easing .
 the dollar could fall substantially .
 investors are likely to be confounded by this policy action , which would be seen as reversing the thrust of policy over the past year . unless subsequent data suggested substantial weakness in the economy and price pressures , inflation expectations and bond yields ultimately could rise under this alternative .
 directive language",-0.5," the existing structure of interest rates appears to incor- porate some expectation that monetary policy may be a little firmer in the near term than is assumed under alternative b . as a consequence , with federal funds continuing around 9 - 3/4 percent or even a little above under alternative b , money market rates might tend to decline a bit .
 three- month treasury bills at the current level of 9 percent would seem appro- priately priced in relation to the prevailing federal funds rate under usual supply and demand conditions ; but if strong retail demands continue , these rates also might edge lower , especially once the early - april cash management bill is absorbed .
 the dollar might come under some downward pressure as short - term rates softened and the prospects for further near- term monetary tightening in the united states were reassessed .

 should the incoming data point more clearly to continued strength in the economy and prices , consistent with the greenbook forecast , bond yields would be unlikely to fall with an unchanged system policy stance and could even move higher .
 growth in m2 under alternative b , at 3 percent from march to june , would be stronger on average than over the first three months of this year .
 as discussed above , deposit weakness at thrifts is expected to continue , but to abate .
 in addition , with short - term market rates moving a bit below current levels and rates on deposits edging higher in response to previous increases in market rates , opportunity costs would be narrow- ing , rather than rising as in recent months .
 even so , the lagged effects of earlier substantial increases in opportunity costs would continue to restrain m2 growth and result in a 4 - 1/2 percent increase in its velocity in the second quarter , somewhat faster than in the second half of 1988 .
 m1 would continue about flat over the march - to - june period as outflows of transactions deposits about match growth in currency ; consequently , its velocity would increase at around the projected 7 - 3/4 percent increase in nominal gnp .
 - m3 is projected to grow at a 5 percent annual rate over the march - to - june period under alternative b , somewhat faster than from december to march .
 commercial banks are expected to continue issuing substantial amounts of large cds to fund still strong merger - related loan demands .
 at thrifts , even if asset growth does n't pick up , m3 could still be boosted relative to earlier this year as less weakness in retail deposits is reflected in reduced reliance on fhlb advances .
 contributing to the pickup in m3 growth would be a resumption of inflows to institu- tion - only money funds as their returns catch up to market rates .
 on a quarterly average basis , m3 would grow at a 5 percent rate , implying an increase of 2 - 1/2 percent in its velocity .",0," the extent of immediate policy tightening embodied in alternative c is more than currently seems to be built into market interest rates .
 in response to the federal funds rate moving into the 10 - 1/4 per- cent area , other short - term market rates would be expected to rise some-
 what less ; the prime rate would be hiked again , probably by 1/2 percentage point .
 the dollar would be expected to firm .
 bond rates are likely to increase under this alternative , but the extent of any rise might be limited , and over time yields could drop back , if market participants saw the tightening action as reducing the risks of greater inflation and raising the odds on an appreciable moderation in economic growth .
 with the further rise in market rates , m2 would expand at a 2 percent annual rate over the march - to - june period under alternative c , only a bit faster than the december - to - march pace .
 growth at this rate would place this aggregate noticeably below its 3 to 7 percent growth cone by june .
 higher market rates along with the lagged adjustment of offering rates on m3 type - money market mutual funds would weaken inflows to such funds .
 m3 expansion , at 4 - 1/2 percent over the march - to - june period , while picking up some from the sluggish rate of recent months , would remain in the lower portion of its long - run range .",0.5,,,0.0
6,1989-05-16," m2 under all the alternatives embodies some impetus from the decline in market rates over the intermeeting period , as well as a common catch - up factor .
 in addition , any effect that thrift deposit outflows might have had on m2 growth earlier in the year is likely to be even smaller , as such outflows continue to abate .
 nevertheless , owing to the impact of tax payments in late april and early may , m2 is projected to decline in may , before growing in june .
 as a consequence , this aggregate through june should remain below the 3 percent lower bound of its target cone , even under the reduced interest rates of alternative a . however , if money market conditions of either alternative a or b were maintained through the summer , the waning effects of earlier increases in market interest rates , reinforced by the delayed upward adjustment of liquid deposit rates , likely would bring m2 within its annual range by the end of the third quarter , assuming spending and income growth close to the green- book projections .
 m1 also is expected to strengthen , though given its adverse opportunity costs , this aggregate would only level out in june under b , and under all three alternatives would remain substantially below its march level .
 the velocity of m2 would be expected to increase between a 5 and 6 percent rate in the second quarter under the three alternatives ; this is substantially faster than would be predicted from our models of money demand , given the interest rates of the three alternatives and greenbook gnp , reflecting in part the depressing effect of the tax - related drawdown on quarterly average m2 .
 the easing of the federal funds rate under alternative a would result in further declines in short - term rates of an additional 1/4 percentage point .
 with a policy move of this dimension this soon still unexpected by market participants , it could reinforce the perception that market rates have peaked , fueling a further rally in fixed - income and stock markets .
 on the other hand , if the federal reserve were seen in light of subsequent developments to have moved prematurely , the easing could rekindle inflation concerns .
 in any case , some downward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would be likely as interest differentials favoring dollar assets narrowed further .",-0.25,"-- under alternative b , funds would continue to trade in the 9 - 3/4 to 9 - 7/8 percent range ; in light of recent experience , unchanged reserve market conditions are likely to involve borrowing of around $ 600 million .",0," the tightening of policy under alternative c would be a considerable surprise to financial markets , and would likely induce a substantial - backup in rates .
 increases in short - term interest rates could exceed the nearly 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate , as the market reassessed the federal reserve 's monetary policy strategy .
 if such a tightening were not followed by stronger economic data , risk premi- ums on private paper might widen further , as worries spread about a pos- sible recession and its effect on credit quality .
 long - term treasury rates likely would rise , at least initially , but by less than yields on corporate bonds and mortgage - backed securities ; over time , any rate increase might be reversed if such a policy came to be seen as raising the odds on disinflation .
 additional upward pressure on the dollar would emerge from the higher u.s . real interest rates , absent similar tightening actions abroad .",0.5,,,0.0625
7,1989-08-22,"-- under alternative a , seasonal credit would have to drop significantly from current levels .
 a 50 basis point reduction in the trading range for federal funds would come more promptly , and be larger , than the easing currently built into the structure of interest rates .
 money market interest rates could drop 1/4 percentage point or so -- and somewhat more if the action itself fostered the notion that the federal reserve would be inclined to undertake additional steps to loosen reserve pressure in the months ahead .
 a rally in bond markets also would seem probable , espe- cially because inflation concerns do not now seem to be weighing on market psychology ; however , should spending prove reasonably strong , there is some risk that such concerns would be reignited against the background of the further easing of policy in alternative a .
 some downward adjustment to the exchange value of the dollar also could occur since foreign author- ities would be unlikely to follow up with comparable easing actions in light of inflationary pressures abroad .
-- the lower interest rates of alternative a could boost m2 growth to a 7 - 1/2 percent rate in september , and , with comparable growth in the fourth quarter , to 4 - 3/4 percent for the year .",-0.5," markets still seem to expect a slight easing of policy over the months ahead .
 the stability of the funds rate around the current level under alternative b , especially if combined with incoming economic data in line with the greenbook forecast of sustained economic growth , would raise further doubts in securities markets about the likelihood of such an easing .
 the alteration of market perceptions about future policy moves may induce a small rise in private money market rates .
 treasury bill rates already have adjusted upward relative to private short - term rates in reflection of actual and near - term heavy supply .
 thus , they could edge up by less than private rates -- to the 8 percent level -- as the recent surge in bill issuance recedes after the initial rtc funding is completed .
 intermediate- and long - term yields could move up over coming months , though by limited amounts should inflation remain moderate in line with the staff forecast .
 supported by slightly higher market rates , strength in the dollar on foreign exchange markets could persist , at least for a time .
 although passage of thrift legislation should bolster depos- itor confidence and forestall some thrift deposit outflows , the substitu- tion of rtc funds ( not in the aggregates   for deposits and other liabili- ties , along with discouragement of asset expansion at thrifts , are alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates

 chart 4 debt billions of dollars -actual level projected level 10.5 % expected on balance to damp growth of the broader aggregates.2 the restraining effect might be particularly evident in the period just ahead owing to the inducement for the rtc to spend $ 20 billion by the end of september .
 most of those funds are likely to replace current s&l liabili- ties , with particular focus on high - yielding liabilities .
 with respect to m2 , premia on offering rates on small time deposits at insolvent thrifts should decline , with a more general softening of deposit rates possible at both banks and thrifts as competitive pressures become less intense.3   in response to the higher opportunity costs on deposits , some portion of the funds withdrawn is likely to be transferred by the public into investments outside m2 .
 this would be particularly true of brokered deposits , which often are of high denomination ( $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 ) and may be held by especially rate - sensitive investors .
 partly as a consequence , m2 growth under alternative b is projected to slow from around 8 percent in august to 6 percent in september , with the resolution impact accounting for per- haps as much as 1 percentage point of the moderation .
 moreover , the rebound in market rates since their lows in late july has widened oppor- tunity costs , which will also tend to damp m2 growth .
 the influence of the legislation on m3 will be considerably larger .
 those government funds not substituting for m2 liabilities will 2 .
 in addition to outright deposit payouts , rtc will use its resources to make advances or deposits at operating insolvent institutions ; the staff presumes that even in the case of deposits these liabilities will not be counted in the monetary aggregates .
 depositories purchasing the deposits of liquidated thrifts apparently will have the right to lower rates on the acquired deposits to the passbook savings rate .
 thrifts under conservatorship , but not yet liquidated , will be discouraged from offering above - market rates ; this is likely to have its most important effect on brokered deposits , which usually are included in the small - time category . be available to substitute for managed liabilities , including those in m3 .
 moreover , assets held by insolvent thrifts will decline as these institu- tions are liquidated or pared in size by rtc conservators ; some assets will be sold into markets and others may be acquired by the rtc , which would fund them from non - m3 sources .
 tighter capital requirements and more restrictive asset standards also should hold down asset expansion at other thrifts , whose sales of mortgage - backed securities may begin to be supplemented by sales of junk bonds .
 while thrift rps and large time deposits should continue to decline , some of the reduction in managed liabilities at thrifts will take the form of repayments of fhlb advances and other non - m3 borrowing , muting the decline in m3.5 moreover , responding to the higher spreads on mortgages , banks are likely to absorb a portion of thrift assets , boosting their needs for funds .
 on balance , the thrift situation is projected to damp m3 growth by about 2 percentage points in september to 5 percent under alternative b .",0," under alternative c , market interest rates would back up abruptly , given that the federal reserve policy tightening would come as a surprise .
 increases in short rates by more than the 1/2 percentage point rise in the funds rate could well occur , as market participants reassessed not only current but also future money market conditions in light of a more restrictive policy stance than they anticipated .
 the advance in bond yields probably would be more restrained in view of the implications of higher short - term rates for future economic activity and inflation .
 such monetary policy tightening would result in some additional upward pressure on the dollar .",0.5,,,0.0
8,1989-10-03," under alternative a , short - term interest rates are likely to fall in tandem with the 50 basis point drop in the funds rate .
 the dollar would decline , and the decline might be substantial if the federal reserve 's action were interpreted as a willingness to use monetary policy to bring about a depreciation of the dollar .
 bond rates probably would move lower , though by less than short - term rates .
 limiting the response of bonds might be a sense that following the unanticipated easing of policy , the economy could be a little stronger than previously expected in 1990 and price pressures somewhat amplified , especially if the drop in the dollar were particularly sharp .
 the decline in rates would tend to boost m2 growth to a somewhat faster pace than in august and september .
 early next year , the continuing effects of the further decline in opportunity costs , along with a tendency for income growth to begin to strengthen , likely would result in growth of m2 at a rate above the committee 's tenta- tive range for 1990 .
 m3 growth would strengthen to a 5 percent rate over the september - to - december period under alternative a .",-0.5," interest rates would be expected to remain near current levels under alternative b . markets do not now appear to be anticipating any near - term change in policy , and incoming economic data consistent with the staff greenbook forecast are not likely to provoke significant change in market sentiment .
 in the weeks ahead , treasury markets may be buffeted by the possible sale of sizable volumes of refcorp bonds and by shifting odds on triggering a debt ceiling decline on november 1 , which could affect the mid - quarter refunding .
 the dollar would be expected to fluctuate around current lower levels , or weaken a little further should some key foreign central banks tighten policy -- as to a degree now seems to be expected by markets .
 should the dollar rebound strongly , however , domestic interest rates might edge off if market participants saw this as implying reduced inflation pressures and greater prospects for policy easing in the united states .
 under alternative b , m2 is expected to grow at a 6 - 1/2 per- cent annual rate over the september - to - december period , a little below the recent pace .
 this implies quarterly average growth at a 6 - 3/4 percent rate and a further decline in velocity at about a 1 - 1/2 percent rate , re- flecting the lagged effects of earlier interest rate declines .
 monthly inflows to retail m2 would be expected to moderate as the effects of pre- vious declines in opportunity costs abate , and as money funds no longer are boosted by shifts from junk bond funds and by special promotional efforts .
 retail deposit growth at thrift institutions is likely to remain sluggish owing to the less aggressive bidding posture of these institu- tions recently .
 on the other hand , overnight rps are not expected to run off further and demand deposits might strengthen if compensating balances need to be boosted by year - end to take account of the lower level of mar- ket interest rates .
 overall , ml should grow at around a 4 - 1/2 percent rate over this period , near its september pace .
 under alternative b , m3 growth would pick up a bit from its august and september pace to a 4 - 1/2 percent rate .
 in addition to the slowing of reductions in assets and m3 liabilities at thrifts , bank credit may strengthen .
 while banks continue to enjoy relatively favorable core deposit inflows , banks will need to tap additional managed liabilities to fund the faster credit growth and replace balances withdrawn by the treasury .
 banks should continue to make further large acquisitions of mortgage assets , whose returns are still relatively attractive .
 more generally , enlarged issuance of mortgage - backed securities and heightened activity by sponsored agencies will facilitate the redistribution of mortgage lending without further significant effects on its cost and availability .
 in the business sector , borrowing is expected to remain around the reduced pace of recent months , despite some dropoff in cor- porate share retirements owing in part to the higher cost of leveraging .
 although treasury borrowing also will slacken , this deceleration merely represents - the movement of rtc financing off budget in the new fiscal year , rather than a decline in underlying credit demands .
 in total , domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to grow at around an 8 percent annual rate over the fourth quarter , implying similar growth for the year , a little below the midpoint of its annual monitoring range .",0," the tightening of policy under alternative c would come as a surprise to the markets , especially in the present international environ- ment .
 money market interest rates would rise by around the 50 basis point hike in the federal funds rate , and the dollar would strengthen .
 with such a tightening not built into yield curves , bond rates would be expected to firm somewhat in the near term as the market reassessed the degree of aggressiveness by the system in pursuing its price stability objective .
 m2 growth over the september - to - december period would slow to a 5 percent rate .
 the composition of inflows would move toward small time deposits , whose rates adjust more promptly , and away from liquid accounts ; its m1 component would slow to a 2 - 1/2 percent rate .
 the restraining effects of higher interest rates and opportunity costs under this alterna-
 tive should be sufficient to hold m2 to around the middle of its tentative 1990 range in the early part of next year .
 m3 would grow at only a 4 percent annual rate , ending the year very close to the lower end of its 1989 range .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
9,1989-11-14,"-- in alternative a , a federal funds rate around 8 percent would be accompanied by a borrowing assumption of $ 100 million .
 the 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative a would come sooner and be larger than market partici- pants are now expecting .
 rates on other short - term instruments would decline by nearly the same amount , with the 3-month bill rate dropping ultimately toward the 7 percent area .
 in response to the further narrow- ing of differentials between u.s . and foreign interest rates , the exchange value of the dollar could be expected to adjust downward .
 bond yields probably would decline noticeably under alternative a ; market participants may interpret an immediate further easing as suggesting a more aggressive policy posture by the federal reserve , and perhaps an assessment of sub- stantial underlying weakening in the economy .
 however , should incoming data show the economy continuing to advance at its recent pace over coming months , in the context of a weaker dollar , the cumulative effect of past easing measures and alternative a over a short time might be viewed as setting the stage for a subsequent strengthening of the economy , raising questions about prospects for prices .
 under alternative a , growth of m2 and m3 through december would be boosted slightly by the associated decline in market interest rates and easing of lending conditions .
 september - to - december m2 and m3 growth would rise to 8 and 4 - 3/4 percent rates , respectively .",-0.5," market interest rates generally are expected to remain around current levels under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alterna-
 the structure of market interest rates appears to embody another slight easing of monetary policy , but most probably not until late this year or early next year .
 in addition , impressions of a sluggish economy , consistent with data flows likely under the staff forecast , may continue to foster expectations of future policy easing , even if federal funds rates remain near 8 - 1/2 percent .
 unlike most other rates , those on short- term treasury bills may drop once the large supply of cash management bills is absorbed into portfolios , with the 3-month bill rate moving down toward 7 - 1/2 percent .
 the exchange value of the dollar could exhibit little net change over the intermeeting period under alternative b , though any policy tightening abroad may tend to exert downward pressure on the dollar .
 even under the unchanged interest rates of alternative b , m2 growth would remain close to last month 's brisk pace , buoyed by recent declines in market interest rates and opportunity costs .
 under this alternative , m2 is expected to expand at a 7 - 1/4 percent average annual rate in november and december ; growth from september to december and on a fourth - quarter average basis would be 7 - 1/2 percent .
 this combines with the staff 's nominal gnp projection of 5 percent for the quarter to imply a 2 - 1/2 percent rate of decline in m2 velocity , roughly consistent with model - based forecasts incorporating the recent reductions in opportunity costs .
 m1 is projected to slow to a 6 - 1/4 percent rate in the last two months of the year from the elevated pace of october . representing a partial offset , however , inflows to nontransaction retail deposits are seen as strengthening somewhat this month and next , as the effects of the recent policy easings take hold .
 this projection includes a strengthening in demand deposits in december , reflecting an expected need to adjust compensating balances upward before closing the books on 1989 , as a consequence of interest rate declines this quarter .
 such year - end adjustments have occurred in several recent years .

 m3 growth under alternative b will continue to be damped by the ongoing shedding of assets by undercapitalized s&ls and by funds supplied through rtc resolutions .
 however , m3 is expected to grow in november and december a bit faster than in october , leaving expansion over the last three months of the year at a 4 - 1/2 percent rate .
 the pace of decline in s&l assets is expected to wane a little over the next two months from the extremely rapid pace of the last few months , and rtc resolutions should slow after the fiscal year - end spurt .
 as a consequence , outflows of large time deposits and term rps at thrifts should abate somewhat .
 commercial bank credit is likely to slow but expansion of managed liabilities will be maintained , in part to compensate for reduced rtc funds of thrift deposit transfers .
 growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to moderate to around 7 percent over the rest of the year , owing mainly to a slowing of federal government debt .
 this would leave the debt aggregate in the fourth quarter 8 - 1/4 percent above its year - earlier level , close to the midpoint of its monitoring range .
-- under alternative b , m2 would expand around the 7 percent upper limit of its tentative range in the early months of 1990 .",0,,N,,,0.0
10,1990-03-27," an immediate policy easing under alternative a that brought the federal funds rate down to 7 - 3/4 percent would run counter to market sentiment and ripple through the money market , with other short - term rates likely declining a similar amount .
 lower short - term funding costs also should engender reductions in lending rates on business and consumer credit .
 the exchange value of the dollar would tend to adjust downward .
 a dollar depreciation might combine with prospects for somewhat stronger u.s .
 economic activity to heighten domestic inflationary expectations , limiting the declines in longer - term yields .

 financial market participants evidently expect no monetary policy change in the near term , meaning that a funds rate around the 8 - 1/4 percent level of alternative b is built into the current structure of market interest rates .
 even so , alternative b would involve some easing in treasury bill rates from most recent levels to the extent that supply pressures in the market dissipate .
 that will depend to some extent on the pace of rtc activity and associated working capital needs .

 9500 funding needs would be met in the first instance by a drawdown in treasury cash balances -- since some rtc working capital usage has already been financed -- and only subsequently by augmenting treasury borrowing .
 quently , we are projecting a substantial paydown in treasury bills over the intermeeting period after the tax date .
 moreover , central bank sales of treasury securities to fund their dollar sales in foreign exchange markets could drop off at any time should intervention activity decline .
 the staff anticipates relative stability in the exchange value of the dollar under alternative b . decisions regarding economic and monetary union of east and west germany , which are to be made by the end of april , could affect the dollar 's value against the mark .
 if those decisions heighten expectations of german inflation , the dollar could continue under upward pressure against the mark ; increases in german interest rates owing solely to such expectations would not necessarily affect real and nominal interest rates in the united states .
 bond prices in the u.s . will remain most sensitive to prospects for u.s . economic growth and inflation .
 incoming data on prices and the economy about in line with staff expecta- tions should not change market expectations that federal reserve policy will remain essentially unchanged for a time , and consequently would be associated with only minor movements in bond yields .
 under alternative b , m2 growth from march to june is pro- jected at a 6 percent annual rate -- about 1/2 percentage point below its average growth rate over the first three months of the year .
 nominal income growth is projected to slow next quarter .
 opportunity costs may narrow only a little from recently elevated levels .
 thrifts are discour- aging deposit inflows as part of their effort to trim balance sheets ; many of these deposits are going to banks instead , and these deposit shifts would be augmented as the rtc steps up the rate at which it resolves institutions .
 banks may be unwilling , however , to expand their assets in line with deposit inflows , given concerns about loan quality and the capital requirements associated with a pickup in asset growth .
 in such circumstances , offering rates on retail deposits are likely to stay some-
 what depressed relative to treasury bill rates .
 with opportunity costs little changed , velocity probably will be about flat in the second quar- ter.3 m1 is expected to continue expanding at a 4 - 1/2 percent annual rate from march to june , as a slowing of currency growth is offset by a little faster inflow to transactions deposits than over the first quar- ter.4
 m3 growth under alternative b is projected at a 4 percent pace , somewhat higher than the december - to - march rate of advance .
 the acceleration primarily owes to some pickup in bank credit growth from 6 - 1/2 percent over the first quarter to around a 7 - 1/4 percent pace , reflecting a resumption of business lending ; as a consequence , the decline in large time deposits at commercial banks should cease .
 in addition , the runoff of the term eurodollar component of this aggregate is likely to ebb .
 greater rtc activity would tend to hold down m3 growth to the extent that such activity necessitated additional government borrowing ; the expenditure of funds previously borrowed by the treasury would not affect m3 because such funds are already on deposit at commercial banks .
 thrifts are assumed to continue trimming their large time deposits at about the 25 percent annual rate of the first quarter , while their runoffs of term rps abate a bit because the outstanding stock of these liabilities has fallen to a rather low level .
 3 . revisions to the staff greenbook forecast for 1990 have counter- vailing effects on projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates for the year as a whole .
 projected m2 and m3 growth remains unchanged at 6 - 1/2 and 4 percent , respectively , as the impact of stronger gnp growth is about offset by higher nominal interest rates .
 4 . owing to the outlook for slower currency growth , the monetary base is projected to record a 4 - 3/4 percent annual rate of change from march to june , compared with the 10 percent increase from december to march .",0,"-- while the 8 - 3/4 percent funds rate of alternative c reflects borrowing of $ 200 million . predicting the rela- tionship between the federal funds rate and discount window borrowing remains difficult , however , justifying continued flexibility in the desk 's approach to the borrowing objective .
 the rise in the federal funds rate under alternative c to 8 - 3/4 percent also would surprise market participants , inducing an across- the - board increase of comparable size in other short - term rates .
 recent upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would continue .
 bond yields would tend to rise , though with inflation expectations lessened by the monetary policy tightening , the increases could be muted .
 the addi- tional policy restraint might reinforce current concerns about default risk on some loan categories , and would tend to encourage a further firm- ing in credit standards , implying additional restraint on economic activity .
-- under the tighter financial market conditions of alternative c , m2 and m3 growth from march to june likely would slow to 5 and 3 - 1/2 percent rates , respectively .",0.5,,,0.0
11,1990-05-15," the easing of reserve conditions under alternative a would tend to strengthen money growth over may and june to something more in line with rates incorporated in the committee 's expectations at the last meeting .
 opportunity costs would narrow even more , boosting m2 growth to nearly a 6 percent rate over may and june , leaving this aggregate notice- ably above the midpoint of its annual range .
 m3 growth would firm to a 4 percent annual rate , keeping this aggregate a little above the lower bound of its range .
 the easing of policy under alternative a would come as something of a surprise to most market participants , and money market rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate .
 the dollar would come under downward pressure , and , absent incoming information pointing to a weaker economy or a distinct improvement in underlying cost or price trends , the decline in bond rates would be limited , resulting in a steeper yield curve .
 if , however , evidence sug- gested a softening in economic activity , perhaps reflecting more powerful credit restraint than now seems apparent , the drop in short - term rates would feed through to bond yields .
 the decline in market rates would tend to buoy borrowing and spending by those with market access , helping to offset the effects of tighter credit availability on spenders dependent on depository intermediaries .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would be expected to continue to trade around 8 - 1/4 percent , with an initial level of adjust- ment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 350 million .
 interest rates generally would be expected to show little net change under alternative b . market expectations now embody federal funds continuing to trade around 8 - 1/4 percent , as under this alternative .
 similarly , incoming information on the economy consistent with the green- book forecast would be roughly in line with the continued economic growth and moderation in measured inflation -- though with little improvement in longer - term price trends -- that market participants now seem to be antici- pating .
 rates on treasury bills and notes , however , could be subject to transitory supply pressures if rtc activity accelerates appreciably and with it treasury financing needs .
 a breakthrough in negotiations on the budget between the administration and the congress in coming weeks would be likely to spark a rally in capital markets , which after a time might induce a downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 absent such a breakthrough , the dollar likely would remain around recent levels on foreign exchange markets ; with the dollar stable and german reunification impending , a tightening of monetary policy in germany and japan before the next fomc meeting appears unlikely .
 projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from march to june are given in the table below for all three alternatives .
 ( the table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data . )
 under alternative b , growth in both m2 and m3 would pick up over may and june from the sluggish pace of april .
 this pickup results in part from a cessation of the runoff of demand deposits and rps .
 in addition , the response of depositors to previous increases in opportunity costs would begin to wane .
 moreover , opportunity costs have already narrowed from april and , with market interest rates stable , this narrowing could con- tinue , buoying retail deposit inflows , as banks raise small time deposit rates , albeit slowly , in adjustment to increases in market rates on bal- ance this year .
 to an extent , the strengthening of m2 and m3 under this alternative rests on a rebound in bank credit growth and associated fund-
 ing needs in may and june -- given the evidence that reductions in willing- ness to lend are limited .
 again , the behavior of the rtc constitutes a major uncertainty in the outlook for money growth .
 to date in the second quarter , rtc spending still has been fairly modest .
 we have assumed pro- gressively more resolution activity over may and june , but well below rtc 's announced goal of 141 resolutions involving $ 50 billion of assets for this quarter .
 a surge in rtc activity could damp m3 growth as thrift assets end up on the government 's balance sheet .
 and it could affect m2 as well , if large volumes of retail deposits are transferred to commercial banks without accompanying loans and investments , reducing bank needs to raise deposit offering rates .
 on balance , m2 growth is projected to strengthen to a 5 percent pace on average in may and june , in line with average growth over the first four months of the year .
 m3 growth would remain quite sluggish as thrifts continued to shrink -- through rtc resolu- tions and through action to meet capital requirements -- but would pick up a little to about a 3 - 1/2 percent pace from growth of around 1 percent in march and april .

 short - term rates would increase by about the 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate , and the dollar would tend to firm .

 however , in the context of only moderate growth in the economy , the higher short - term interest rates and slower money growth would be seen as a policy response to inflation pressures , implying additional emphasis by the federal reserve on its price stability objective .
 in this context , the credibility of that objective could be enhanced , to the benefit of bond prices .
 directive language ( 14 ) draft language for the operational paragraph , including the usual options , is shown below .
 operational paragraph in the implementation of policy for the immediate future , the committee seeks to decrease somewhat / maintain/ increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions .
 taking account of progress toward price stabil- ity , the strength of the business expansion , the behavior of the monetary aggregates , and developments in foreign ex- change and domestic financial markets , slightly ( somewhat ) greater reserve restraint ( would / might ) or slightly ( some-
 what ) lesser reserve restraint would ( might ) be acceptable in the intermeeting period .
 the contemplated reserve condi- tions are expected to be consistent with growth of m2 and m3 over the period from march through june at annual rates of about   and
 [ del : 6 and 4 ] percent respectively .
 the chairman may call for committee consultation if it appears to the manager for domestic operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of   to
 [ del : 6 to 10 ] percent .

12,1990-08-21,"-- under alternative a , the drop in the federal funds rate to 7 - 1/2 percent would accom-
 the easing of reserve market conditions under alternative a would engender a like - sized decline in short - term interest rates .
 the response of long - term interest rates to an easing is unclear .
 if incoming information suggests sluggish economic growth or tighter credit condi- tions , inflation concerns may not be heightened further by the policy easing , and bond yields would fall .
 however , especially in the context of the oil price shock , if the easing were interpreted as signalling greater concern by the fomc with maintaining output growth than with containing inflation , the decline in the dollar could be particularly sharp , and bond yields could rise .
 m2 , and to a lesser extent m3 , would be a bit stronger under alternative a than with an unchanged funds rate ; the staff projects growth rates from june to september of 4 - 1/2 percent for m2 and 2 - 3/4 percent for m3 .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 8 percent in association with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window of $ 500 million .
 market participants no longer seem to be expecting a near- term easing in policy , and short - term rates would be unlikely to move substantially on balance with federal funds remaining near 8 percent under alternative b . absent a significant change in oil prices , long - term interest rates may stay around recent elevated levels .
 scope for a rally in bond markets seems to exist should a budget accord involving signif- icant deficit reduction be reached after all , counter to current investor skepticism .
 the exchange value of the dollar would be unlikely to retrace much , if any , of its decline since the last committee meeting .
 under alternative b , m3 over august and september is pro- jected to expand at a 3 - 1/2 percent average rate , implying growth of 2 - 1/2 percent from june to september .
 the pickup in m3 does not reflect a pro- jected acceleration in credit at depository institutions .
 rather , it re- flects some strength in elements of this aggregate that are not direct funding sources to such institutions -- money market mutual funds and term- eurodollar deposits.5 bank lending is projected to stay subdued as banks continue to exercise extra caution in extending credit , while thrift balance sheets will shrink further , especially as rtc activities pick up over the balance of the quarter .
 even so , the debt of nonfederal sectors 4 .
 the somewhat stronger incoming data for m2 , including revisions to past months , have led the staff to revise its projection for m2 growth consistent with the greenbook forecast to 4 percent for 1990 , from 3 - 1/2 percent in the last bluebook .
 nominal gnp growth for 1990 is now expected to be lower than in the previous greenbook , but its effects on m2 demand are about offset by the slight reduction in short - term nominal interest rates and opportunity costs .
 5 . data revisions , along with faster money fund inflows , have led to an upward revision to projected m3 growth for 1990 - -from 1 - 1/2 to 2 percent . is projected to continue to grow at a 6 percent rate over the third quarter , about in line with nominal income .
 federal debt growth , on the other hand , is expected to balloon to a 14 percent annual rate over the three months , as rtc working capital needs boost federal marketable borrowing to a record $ 68 billion level ( n.s.a . ) .
 total domestic non- financial debt growth as a consequence is projected at 7 - 3/4 percent over the three months , keeping this aggregate around the midpoint of its annual range .",0," under alternative c , a considerable backup in short - term rates would appear likely , as a monetary policy tightening would fly in the face of market expectations .
 long - term rates might rise only a little , as the increase in real interest rates would be at least partly offset by a lessening in inflation expectations .
 the moderation in inflation expectations would accompany a further downward adjustment of market participants ' outlook for real economic activity -- as the effects of higher real rates were reinforced by an even more cautious attitude of lenders -- and evidence that the federal reserve was leaning against the price effects of the oil shock .
 the dollar could find renewed strength on foreign exchange markets as interest differentials moved in favor of dollar investments .
 m2 and m3 growth over the third quarter would be restrained to 3 - 1/2 and 2 - 1/4 percent , respectively .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
13,1990-10-02," barring an immediate , credible agreement that had already reduced interest rates , the decline in the federal funds rate under alternative a would be expected to show through in other money market interest rates .
 private rates might drop a little more than those on treasury bills if the lower rates were seen as lessening financial stresses .
 with market participants generally viewing the economy as weak , some decline in bond yields may accompany this policy action .
 in the absence of a cred- ible budget agreement or a lessening of tensions in the middle east , any bond market rally would be quite limited , however , if the easing raised questions about the system 's commitment to containing inflation .
 the dollar could come under renewed downward pressure in response to the reduction in u.s . interest rates .
-- under alternative a , the drop in opportunity costs would boost alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m2 m3 m1 alt .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 8 percent .
 it appears that the expectation of an immediate easing of monetary policy is no longer so prevalent in the markets , although some relaxation still seems to be anticipated over coming months , partly reflecting an expected budget accord .
 the market response to unchanged policy under alternative b will depend crucially on budget developments in coming days .
 should an inadequate agreement appear to be in train , rates could reverse some of the declines of recent days , but there would be no effect from holding monetary policy unchanged . as noted above , however , a significant budget agreement would extend the recent market rally and engender expectations of near - term policy action .
 in this case , maintaining unchanged money market conditions for an extended period would disappoint these expectations and cause rates to back up .",0," the tightening of monetary policy under alternative c would be seen under current circumstances as signalling an aggressive stance against the inflationary consequences of the oil shock .
 such a tightening is not anticipated by market participants .
 given concerns about financial fragility , yields on private obligations could rise significantly , while the increase in bill rates could be limited by greater demands for safe assets .
 perceptions that the central bank would not permit inflation to rise permanently as a result of the oil shock would hold down any increase in yields on longer - term instruments .
-- velocity would still decline under alternative c , though by less as opportunity costs widened with the rise in short - term market interest rates .",0.5,,,0.0
14,1990-11-13," in view of the expectations of some easing already built into rates , short - term interest rates would decrease somewhat less than the 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate , under alternative a . banks may be encouraged to advance credit less reluctantly by the wider margins they would enjoy , and by greater confidence of repayment as lower interest rates countered weakness in the economy and bolstered asset prices .
 banks eventually would pass the drop in funding costs on to their customers through a lower prime rate , though the adjustment could be slug- gish , especially given the desire to limit footings at year - end , and mar- gins will remain unusually high .
 in the context of the softer economy and lessened pressures on resources , long - term rates , too , should decline , with fixed - rate mortgages dropping below 10 percent .
 the extent of the decline in long - term rates might be limited should the likely drop in the foreign exchange value of the dollar be especially steep , which would be seen as accentuating price pressures , possibly limiting the scope for further policy easing .
 the odds on a sharper drop in the dollar would be greater if the easing seemed to reflect especially heightened federal reserve concern about the strength of the financial system and the real economy , with reduced priority given to restraining price pressures .
 from this perspective , the risk that market participants would interpret a 1/2 percentage point cut in the federal funds rate as conveying such signals might be increased if the cut were accomplished by a reduction in the discount rate .
-- under alternative a , the drop in opportunity costs would boost m2 to a 2 - 3/4 percent rate over the alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m2 m3 m1 alt .
 m3 would be little changed over november and december under any of the alternatives .
 some pickup in rtc resolution activity from the pace of recent weeks also will tend to restrain growth of the aggregates , especially m3 .
 the slight differences in the growth of m3 under alternative a and c in december would owe largely to inflows to money market mutual funds , as their rate advantage temporarily rose or declined , respectively .
 in all cases , growth in m3 through the first quarter of next year would be around the lower end of its tentative range .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue trading around 7 - 3/4 percent .
-- the associated level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing under alternative b would be set at $ 250 million in the first maintenance period after the meeting and might need to be lowered another $ 50 million over the intermeeting period to accommodate the ongoing decline in the demand for seasonal credit .
 interest rates currently embody anticipation of a 1/4 point drop in the funds rate in the near - term .
 nevertheless , market rates are not likely to back up significantly under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b , since expectations of an easing would be maintained if , as expected , incoming information confirms a weakening economy .
 an un- changed policy would provide some underpinning for the foreign exchange value of the dollar , especially if market participants see that stance as in part motivated by concerns about potential further weakening in the dollar .
 quality spreads may widen further , reflecting year - end position- ing and mounting concerns about defaults .
 a number of large banks , espe- cially those with weak capital positions and eroding access to capital markets , expect to be holding down balance sheet totals to bolster capital positions and investor confidence .
 at the same time , many investors , particularly mutual funds and others publishing year - end statements , are likely to intensify efforts to shed assets of less than top quality , including holdings of some bank obligations .
 under these conditions , it will be difficult to distinguish transitory disturbances in relative interest rates and credit flows from signals of more fundamental and last-
 ing problems of borrowers .",0," under alternative c , the dollar would retrace at least some of its recent decline in response to a rise in the federal funds rate .
 a tightening of policy would come as a surprise to market participants , especially in light of the recent decline in the funds rate on the heels of the budget accord .
 short - term rates would generally rise by 1/4 percentage point or more , as expectations of further easing were extin- guished .
 bond rates also would increase initially .
 quality spreads might widen appreciably , with strains on lower - rated borrowers seen as being heightened as the federal reserve appeared willing to tolerate a weaker path for economic activity .
-- the firming in m2 growth under alternative c would be quite modest and this aggregate would be entering the new year around the lower end of its tentative 1991 range .",0.25,,,-0.25
15,1990-12-18,"-- ( 11 ) implementing alternative a through a reduction in borrowing would bring the funds rate below the discount rate and borrowing to fric- tional levels .
-- funds rate volatility would tend to increase a bit if borrowing were reduced to implement alternative a . in any case , over the intermeet- ing period the desk 's task will be complicated by uncertainties both about year - end effects on required and excess reserve demands and about the impact of the reserve requirement change on demands for excess reserves .
-- the potential for volatility in the funds rate under alternative a would be reduced a little if instead this alternative were implemented through a 1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate , leaving a larger cushion of borrowing .
 with the easing of the funds rate by 1/2 percentage point under alternative a , other short - term market rates would decline , but by smaller amounts given current market expectations .
 however , the prime rate likely would be reduced , perhaps promptly , by the full 1/2 percentage point .
 the policy easing also might make lenders a bit more willing to extend credit to marginal borrowers , in part as lower interest rates im- prove the economic outlook and borrowers ' prospective creditworthiness .
 bond yields would continue to move lower , but the extent of the rally would depend in part on the reaction in foreign exchange markets .
 the dollar would decline , especially if investors saw the action , coming on the heels of recent easing moves , as evidence of an inclination toward a more aggressive easing posture by the federal reserve .
 the reaction of foreign exchange and other financial markets to alternative a may depend on how it is implemented .
 however , any tendency for a discount rate cut to have an independent announcement effect would be muted in the current circumstances , given perceptions that for technical reasons an easing of this magnitude would necessarily involve a discount rate cut .
 selection of alternative a would provide added impetus to m2 growth but would affect m3 and credit expansion only a little , at least over the next few months .
 opportunity costs on retail balances would fall further , lifting m2 growth to a projected 5 percent rate over the november to march period .
 by march , m2 would be near the midpoint of the pro- visional range for next year .
 with banks slightly more inclined to lend , m3 growth would be stimulated a bit : its expected 1 percent rate of 7 .
 at the end of the third quarter , a sizable decline in large time deposits was accompanied by a surge in net eurodollar borrowing .
 the average level of domestic deposits at the ends of the third and fourth quarters of 1990 determine the base for the assessment of the deposit insurance premium over the first half of 1991 .
 growth from november to march would place this aggregate at the lower bound of its tentative annual range .
 directive language",-0.5," securities markets appear to be anticipating another small policy adjustment at some point in the coming intermeeting period , though not necessarily immediately after the meeting .
 hence , market interest and exchange rates would not react much to the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b , at least initially .
 moreover , expectations of further ease likely would be sustained if incoming data confirm the markets ' impression of a significant economic downturn .
 although borrowers and lenders 5 . a more moderate policy easing that involved a 1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate to 6 - 1/2 percent , combined with an initial borrowing specification of $ 125 million , could lessen a bit further the potential volatility of the funds rate , at least once the market recog- nized the new intended trading area of 7 percent for the funds rate .
 in this case , the funds rate would decline 1/4 percentage point , but its spread over the discount rate would return to 1/2 percentage point .
 already have made substantial adjustments to their portfolios in anticipa- tion of year - end pressures , strains still could emerge at times in coming weeks .
 in january , with the threat of year - end pressures and portfolio adjustments behind them , banks may reduce the prime rate . were current reserve conditions to be maintained through the intermeeting period in the face of weak economic data , markets might begin to reassess the federal reserve 's intentions , and interest and exchange rates might edge higher-- although favorable effects on inflation expectations would work to moder- ate any such rise in bond rates .
 in the staff 's judgment , m2 growth under the unchanged funds rate of alternative b will pick up to a 3 - 1/2 percent pace from november to march , placing the aggregate just above the lower bound of the cone associated with the committee 's provisional growth range of 2 - 1/2 to alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates alt .

 stronger growth of nominal income should bol-
 ster money balances in the first quarter .
 in addition , money market mutual funds and , to a lesser extent , retail deposits are expected to respond to the drop in their opportunity costs brought about by the de- clines in short - term market rates over recent months .
 even so , m2 growth on a quarterly average basis would edge up to only a 2 - 3/4 percent rate in the first quarter , which would be below the projected pace of nominal gnp and represent a reversal of the decline in m2 velocity experienced this quarter .
 some of the acceleration in m2 under alternative b would show through to m3 .
 nonetheless , m3 expansion would be held to a 1/2 percent rate from november to march , displaying only slightly less weak- ness than in recent months and coming in below the one percent lower bound of the committee 's provisional growth range for 1991 .
 a variety of fac- tors are expected to continue to limit growth in this aggregate .
 thrift credit is projected to contract further ; bank credit expansion , though likely to pick up after the turn of the year , should remain subdued , espe- cially if further losses in loan portfolios continue to put pressure on capital positions .
 in the near term , banks are likely to use some of the reserve balances released by the drop in reserve requirements to pay down managed liabilities and shrink their footings .
 for a time , this scale effect should dominate the longer - term impact of the reduced reserve cost of issuing nonpersonal time deposits and borrowing from own foreign branches .

 m1 growth of 4 percent is foreseen from november to march .
 with projected growth rates of 6 percent for currency and 3 percent for transaction deposits over the four months , the implied growth of the monetary base would be 5 percent .
 basis points on domestic deposits at commercial banks may marginally deter bank intermediation and encourage a shifting of large time deposits into term rps or offshore .
 of course , m3 would be little affected on net by such shifting since term rps and term eurodollars owned by u.s .
 residents are included in m3 .",0,,N,,,-0.25
16,1991-03-26,"-- however , the discount window becomes a marginally less effective buffer to unpredictable changes in reserve supply or demand , and the federal funds rate likely would be a little more volatile than if alternative a were achieved through a discount rate cut .
 under alternative a , money market rates would likely decrease by close to the full amount of the reduction in the federal funds rate , and the prime rate would be lowered 1/2 percentage point , given its already wide margin over funding costs .
 the dollar would decline promptly and substantially .
 the drop in interest rates and the dollar could be seen by market participants as adding further stimulus at a time when a rebound in the economy already is expected .
 in such circumstances , bond rates might not decline by much , and could even back up .
 a reversal of any adverse reaction would occur , however , if incoming data began to con- firm that the easing had correctly anticipated weaker money growth , more favorable trends in prices , or a substantial further shortfall in economic activity .
 under alternative a , m2 would strengthen to a 6 - 1/2 percent rate over the march - to - june period .
 the pickup would be concentrated in retail liquid accounts as their opportunity costs fell further .
 by june , this aggregate would be well into the upper half of its annual range .
 m3 would expand at a 4 percent rate over this period , buoyed by larger inflows to money funds and by some spillover of the strength in m2 .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 6 percent and would be associated with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially of $ 125 million .
 the structure of market interest rates does not now appear to incorporate expectations of any further easing in monetary policy in the weeks ahead ; thus under alternative b , short - term interest rates are unlikely to change substantially , though they may edge lower .
 private rates should slip off with the passing of quarter - end , and bills could well benefit from steeper reductions in outstanding supplies after the april tax date .
 the greenbook forecast implies some further unwinding of the recent sharp rise in the dollar under the unchanged policy of alternative b . still , with interest rate differentials now more favorable to dollar assets , the dollar should remain well above its february lows .
 longer - term securities markets are likely to continue to be quite sensi- tive to data about developments in the real economy over the intermeeting period , as investors search for indications as to whether consumer and business responses to the end of the war are helping to propel a turn- around in the economy .
 bond yields already seem to have built in some rebound in the economy , judging by their levels relative to inflation expectations and to short - term rates .
 thus , they might not rise much , if at all , even should incoming information confirm that the economy was reaching a trough .
 on a quarterly average basis , m2 under alternative b would expand at a 6 percent annual rate in the second quarter , a shade faster than nominal gnp .
 expansion at this rate would be a bit higher than pre- dicted by the staff money demand models , implying a partial makeup of the shortfall of recent quarters .
 the projection thus assumes a continuation of the very recent experience , in which some of the unusual factors that 5 . growth rates for individual months are likely to be influenced by tax payments this year .
 reflecting weakness in income last year , non- withheld tax payments due by april 15 could well fall short of those embedded in the seasonal adjustment factors for monetary aggregates .
 thus , both the buildup of balances prior to that date and the decline in balances after it may be smaller than usual ; in these circumstances , june growth could speed up a little more as the economic recovery fore- seen by the staff shows through to demands for money .
 6 . under alternative b , m1 also is projected to grow at an annual rate of 5 - 1/2 percent over the march - to - june period , as transaction deposits complete their adjustments to interest rate changes , and as currency demand abates with the end of war - related uncertainties .
 the level of demand deposits may be boosted to some degree by greater mortgage refinancing at the reduced levels of rates on fixed - rate mortgages of recent months ; prepayments of securitized mortgages generally are held in demand deposits for some time before being passed through to security holders .
 however , at current interest rates , the effects of this on m1 growth rates are expected to be quite small in coming months .
 growth of the monetary base is expected to slow to a 5 - 1/4 percent rate in the second quarter . had been damping money growth in earlier quarters seem less pronounced .
 the recent recovery in confidence by depositors and investors in the bank-
 ing system is not expected to be reversed , and against this backdrop , constriction of credit supplies by banks should not intensify .
 while opportunity costs will rise as offering rates continue to adjust , they are not expected to become unusually wide in coming months .
 growth in m3 would slow to a 3 - 1/2 percent rate over the march - to - june period in the case of alternative b . to be sure , a modest pickup in bank lending and in the associated needs for funds is antici- pated as credit demands strengthen with spending ; banks should be willing to meet this demand in light of improved prospects for borrowers , enhanced access to capital markets and the recent regulatory initiatives .
 however , rate relationships are expected to be less favorable to money funds .
 in addition , the unusual issuance of large time deposits by u.s . branches of foreign banks related to the reserve requirement cut is assumed to slow in the second quarter .
 rtc resolution activity will pick up over the quar- ter , so that increasing quantities of thrift assets will end up financed by treasury securities instead of m3 .
 even with its slowing , m3 would remain above the midpoint of its annual range by june .
 on a quarterly average basis , m3 would grow at a 4 - 1/2 percent rate in the second quar- ter , once again lagging growth in nominal income .",0,"-- under alternative c , the federal funds rate would rise to 6 - 1/2 percent and the initial borrow-
 the tightening of policy under alternative c would surprise market participants , coming on the heels of recent easing measures , and bill rates would rise by 1/2 percentage point .
 private money market rates could well rise by more and quality spreads retrace some of their recent declines .
 in particular , a portion of the improvement since year - end in the prices of securities of financial firms likely would be reversed by the unexpected increase in short - term rates .
 increases in bond yields might be limited , however , by a sense that the federal reserve was taking early action to check potential inflation pressures in the coming recov- ery .
 in this environment , the dollar would be subject to further upward pressure .
 the tighter money market conditions of alternative c would slow m2 from the pace of december to march , holding this aggregate down to the midpoint of its 1991 range by june .
 growth over the three months would moderate to a 3 percent rate , with some risk that expansion could be even more damped if there were an appreciable adverse reaction in bank capital and funding markets .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
17,1991-05-14,"-- under alternative a , federal funds would trade around 5 - 1/4 percent ; this level could be achieved either by a reduction in the initial borrowing specification to $ 175 million together with the current 5 - 1/2 percent discount rate , or by a cut in the discount rate to 5 percent combined with the $ 225 million initial borrowing specification .
 money growth projections under the two alternatives are shown below .
 ( more detailed data appear in the table and charts on the following pages . )
 under both alternatives , the monetary aggregates are expected to strengthen in may and june from their reduced april rates , keeping m2 and m3 in the middle portions of their annual ranges through midyear .
 the projected pickup in m2 growth primarily reflects the unwind- ing of apparently tax - related weakness in april .
 the effects of previous 5 .
 under any of these policy approaches , further increases in seasonal borrowing are likely to necessitate upward technical adjustments to the borrowing assumption over the intermeeting period .
 declines in interest rates continue to contribute to the growth of m2 relative to income .
 however , largely because of the downward revisions to forecasts for nominal income in the second quarter , we now expect m2 growth over march to june to fall short of the pace specified in the last directive .
 this shortfall occurs despite the slight easing in money mar- ket rates at the end of april and persists even with the further drop in rates under alternative a .
 the march - to - june growth projected for m3 also has been lowered since the last meeting , but in this case the reduction results entirely from the aggregate 's unexpected weakness in april .
 jected expansion of m3 in may and june is about the same as in the last bluebook , as additional issuance of cds by u.s .
 branches and agencies of foreign banks offsets the effect of slower growth in m2 and depository credit .

 because the immediate 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal funds rate under alternative a would come as a surprise to finan- cial market participants , most of it would be passed through to other short - term market interest rates , and the prime rate likely would be reduced again .
 bond yields are likely to decline in response , especially if this action were seen as signalling the federal reserve 's assessment that the economic situation was worsening or price pressures were sub- stantially reduced .
 however , with this easing coming on the heels of the recent discount rate reduction , alternative a would be seen as especially aggressive and could arouse concerns about the expected downward trajec- tory for inflation unless softness in the economy or prices were confirmed by subsequent data .
 with quality spreads already having narrowed con- siderably , any further decline in private interest rates relative to trea- sury yields is likely to be quite limited .
 the exchange value of the dollar would tend to adjust downward ; this movement would be limited to the extent the upward pressure on foreign currencies , against a backdrop of a general softening in economic performance abroad , occasioned a relaxation of monetary policy in some major trading partners .
-- ( 14 ) the lower market rates of alternative a would further en- hance the attractiveness of retail deposits , likely boosting the average growth of m2 in may and june to around a 5 - 1/2 percent rate , and to 4 - 1/2 percent from march to june .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , the federal funds rate would remain in the 5 - 3/4 percent area , in association with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 225 million -- an increase of $ 25 million from the current level to take account of the likely rise of sea- sonal borrowing .
 under alternative b , m2 is expected to strengthen to a 4 - 3/4 percent pace in may and june .
 much of the acceleration in m2 is likely to be concentrated in its transaction component .
 m1 should resume growing at nearly a 5 percent pace over the two months , as demand deposits and ocds recover from their tax - related weakness and are buttressed later in the quarter by the expected strengthening in nominal income .
 moreover , currency expansion is expected to reemerge with the waning of reflows from the persian gulf region .
 the nontransaction component of m2 also is likely to accelerate ; money funds should rebound a bit , and , with a smaller amount thought to be maturing , the runoff of retail time deposits probably will abate from the unusually rapid pace of april .
 the 4 percent growth of m2 from march to june under alternative b implies a quarterly average growth rate of 5 percent ; this exceeds the staff 's projected growth of nominal gnp by 2 percentage points , producing a third straight quarter of m2 velocity decline .
 still , the projected m2 growth remains below that forecast by the staff 's econometric model , but , at less than a percentage point , the model overprediction would be considerably smaller than in the last three quarters .
 some lessening of concerns about the soundness of depositories and the virtual cessation of rtc activity and associated disruptions to deposit flows may be the main factors behind the closer alignment of second - quarter m2 growth with historical patterns .
 the growth of m3 under alternative b is seen as picking up to a 3 percent average pace in may and june , lifting its march - to - june 6 .
 depositor confidence , however , might again erode should proposals to limit deposit insurance progress through congress , or should bank failures pick up .
 in the event of losses to uninsured depositors , any effect of these failures on m3 could be amplified .
 rate of change to 2 percent .
 in addition to heavier projected inflows to m2 deposits , rapid issuance of yankee cds seems to be resuming .
 more , the paydown by domestic banks of large time deposits , which was especially pronounced in april , should abate over may and june .
 under- lying depository financing needs should increase as a turnaround in lend- ing to businesses and households produces some expansion in bank credit in the last two months of the quarter .
 nevertheless , growth in overall private nonfinancial debt is expected to remain quite damped , in line with sluggish spending and reflecting the effects of continuing restraint on credit availability and still - elevated loan rates at depository institutions .
 in the federal sector , debt growth is expected to surge over the balance of the second quarter , in part to fund enlarged rtc payouts .
 even so , total domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to grow at only a 4 - 1/2 percent rate from march to june , putting expansion from its fourth - quarter base close to the lower bound of the aggregate 's monitoring range .
 the current structure of interest rates appears to embody market expectations of no further monetary policy move in the near term , so implementation of alternative b is unlikely to engender any immediate reaction in domestic financial or foreign exchange markets .
 over the intermeeting period , market participants no doubt will encounter mixed evidence about the outlook , as is typical in a period near a turning 7 .
 the likely gearing up of rtc activity as the quarter comes to a close will shift assets and associated funding needs from thrifts to the federal government and will accelerate the decline of large time deposits at thrifts , but the pickup is coming so late in the quarter that the effects on monthly m3 will not be felt until july .
 with expectations somewhat fragile , there may be frequent adjust- ments to financial asset prices in the face of these mixed signals .
 markets also may be particularly sensitive to clues about the federal reserve 's policy strategy around the cycle trough ; the unchanged policy stance of alternative b -- if maintained through the intermeeting period in the absence of clear evidence of a trough -- could be seen as incorporating a more cautious policy approach to assuring an upturn .",0,,N,,,0.0
18,1991-08-20,"-- under alternative a , the federal funds rate would decline to 5 percent .
 the 1/2 percentage point drop in the funds rate con- templated under alternative a is larger than the easing of policy currently anticipated in the markets ; thus , short - term rates are likely to move down under this alternative -- but not by as much as the cut in the funds rate -- with the three - month bill rate drifting to near 5 percent .
 if this alternative were implemented through open market operations alone , bringing the funds rate well below the discount rate , market participants might speculate about the need for a dis- count rate cut , and whether such a cut would be accompanied by an additional easing .
 the prime rate likely would decline by the 50 basis point drop in the funds rate , leaving the spread over funding costs at a historically high level .
 bond rates initially would de- crease a bit , but such declines might erode should incoming informa- tion
 suggest that the economic recovery is more solidly under way , along the lines of the staff forecast .
 the dollar would decline on foreign exchange markets .
 the easing of monetary policy under alternative a would boost m2 to a 4 - 1/2 percent annual rate of expansion in september and the pace would firm further in the fourth quarter , lifting growth of this aggregate for the year to around 3 percent .
 pacing m2 next month would be an 8 - 1/2 percent rate of growth in its m1 component and more rapid expansion in its other liquid deposits , whose opportunity costs would diminish still further .
 the opening of even larger intermedia- tion spreads on some credits would enhance bank efforts to raise capi- tal and encourage bankers to pursue more lending opportunities .
 with a little more bank credit to fund and larger inflows to institution- only money funds , m3 would pick up to a 2 - 1/2 percent pace in septem- ber and remain around that rate early in the fourth quarter .
 directive language",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 5 - 1/2 percent , at the discount rate , in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
 in light of persistent weakness in the broader monetary aggregates and other indicators pointing to a sluggish recovery , mar- kets currently see a distinct possibility of some further easing of policy in the weeks ahead .
 with reserve market pressures unchanged , as under alternative b , rates might firm a touch .
 such a firming would further diminish prospects for a cut in the prime rate .
 the extent of any backup in rates , though , would depend on incoming infor- mation : indeed , rates might remain near current levels should m2 run along the lower band of its annual range , as the staff expects , and if new information casts further doubts on the strength of the recovery .
 should pressures on insurance companies mount , quality spreads on lower - rated corporate debt could widen as insurers curtail lending to this segment of the market .
 the dollar likely would trade around current levels under alternative b , but could firm a notch if u.s .
 interest rates were to back up .
 under alternative b , m2 would be expected to increase over the balance of the quarter .
 on a monthly average basis , the sizable decline in m2 in july would be followed by a small drop in august and a 4 percent rate of expansion in september .
 absent a subsequent change in policy , m2 would be expected to continue to increase at about a 4 percent pace over the fourth quarter , as the anticipated strengthening of income offsets the waning effects of earlier declines in rates ; growth for the year would be 2 - 3/4 percent .
 the recent easing would be expected to have its greatest effect on liquid deposits , whose offering rates adjust especially sluggishly .
 m1 is projected to increase at a 7 - 1/2 percent rate in august and september , while outflows from the nontransactions component of m2 would ebb .
 on a quarterly average basis , m2 would be about flat in the third quarter -- well below the growth predicted by models of money demand incorporating the staff 's economic forecast -- and its velocity would rise at a 5 percent rate .
 m1 , in contrast , would grow at nearly a 7 percent annual rate in the current quarter and its velocity would fall at a 2 percent rate .
 m3 would resume growing in september under alternative b , albeit at just a 2 - 1/4 percent pace .
 still , on a quarterly average basis , m3 would fall at a 2 percent rate , its first quarterly decline in more than two decades .
 contributing to the expected sep- tember turnaround in m3 is the pickup in m2 and a resumption of flows to institution - only money funds , prompted by recent declines in market rates .
 on the other hand , acting to hold down m3 growth in the months ahead will be further large decreases in thrift assets owing in part to fairly brisk rtc resolution activity .
 moreover , banks remain quite reluctant to lend , as suggested by recent senior loan officer survey results and the unusually high prime rate in relation to funding costs , and banks involved in mergers could , given various uncertain- ties during the consolidation phase , be making more cautious credit decisions .
 in addition , credit demands are expected to stay light .
 weak capital spending and fairly strong equity issuance will be acting to hold down business credit demands in the months ahead .
 with bond yields down and rate spreads quite narrow , investment - grade borrowers are expected to continue to rely heavily on the bond market for funds .
 lower - rated firms , more dependent on banks and private placements with insurance companies , however , are likely to encounter continued dif- ficulties in getting credit .
 borrowing by state and local governments should remain light as these units struggle with budgetary shortfalls and debt downgradings .
 household borrowing is expected to strengthen a bit as single - family housing activity and consumption outlays con- tinue to firm .
 growth of debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors other than the federal government , while picking up a bit , is expected to remain at depressed levels .
 in contrast , federal borrowing will be robust as deposit insurance outlays remain substantial .
 total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at around a 7 per- cent rate over august and september , leaving this aggregate in the lower portion of its monitoring range in september .",0,,N,,,0.0
19,1991-10-01,"-- under alternative a , federal funds would tend to trade around 4 - 3/4 percent , which could be fostered either by lowering the borrowing specification by $ 50 million to $ 275 million or by lowering the discount rate by a further 1/2 point to 4 - 1/2 percent .
-- the latter approach to alternative a would preserve the present spread of the funds rate over the discount rate and thus the current degree of cushioning of transitory shocks to the supply and demand for reserves .
 the size and timing of the 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal funds rate of alternative a would tend to catch financial markets unawares , inducing almost as large a drop in other short - term interest rates .
 in the context of weak money growth , such an easing might be seen as signifying federal reserve concern that financial conditions , including credit availability , were not consistent with a moderate expansion of the economy .
 in these circumstances , long - term rates would be likely to drop , at least initially , in normal propor- tion to the decline in short - term rates .
 should subsequent data suggest , however , that the recovery is already on track and inflation progress only moderate , long - term rates might back up a bit , as the lower level of short - term rates appeared unsustainable .
 the value of the dollar on exchange markets would ratchet lower in response to the downward movement of interest rates in the united states relative to those abroad .
-- this reasoning yields projected m2 growth over the next three months under alternative a of 4 percent at an annual rate .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , the federal funds rate would be expected to remain centered on 5 - 1/4 percent , in as- sociation with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 325 million.7
 market participants in recent days appear to have built in some prospects for additional easing of monetary policy in the period ahead .
 nonetheless , the unchanged federal funds rate associ- ated with alternative b is unlikely to engender a marked backup in yields in financial markets over the intermeeting period , so long as incoming nonfinancial and monetary data are mixed , as would be the case under the staff 's forecast .
 under those circumstances , the re- cently lower exchange value of the dollar , too , probably will be sustained .
 with elevated federal borrowing needs over the intermeet- ing period continuing to place upward pressure on treasury yields , rate spreads on private instruments over treasury securities also would be anticipated to stay relatively narrow .
 7 . over the intermeeting period , seasonal borrowing would be expected to diminish , necessitating downward technical adjustments to the borrowing specification .
 under the unchanged interest rates of alternative b , m2 growth is projected to pick up to a 3 percent rate over the last three months of the year , leaving this aggregate at the lower bound of its alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m2 m3 m1 alt .

 m1 is expected to grow at a 6 - 1/2 percent pace from september to december , producing a similar growth rate on a quarterly average basis and another decline in m1 velocity in reflec- tion of the recent drop in its opportunity costs.9   on a quarterly average basis , a 2 - 1/4 percent rate of m2 growth would be implied for the year 's final quarter , up from the slight decline posted in the third quarter .
 the gain in the velocity of m2 in the fourth quarter-- given the staff 's projection of 6 percent growth for nominal gnp-- would be somewhat below the estimated 4 - 1/2 percent annual rate of increase in v2 estimated for the third quarter .
 the implied 3 - 1/2 percentage point error in the staff 's standard econometric model for m2 growth would be about half the size of the record miss of the third quarter .
 under alternative b , growth in m3 from september to december is expected to strengthen to a 1 - 1/2 percent annual rate .
 the runoff of commercial bank loans posted over the third quarter is forecast to cease over the fourth quarter .
 with the strengthening of bank capital positions progressing , and the default risk on some loan applicants tempered by improving income prospects , bank lending terms and conditions should remain stable and perhaps even start to ease a 8 .
 we have made no allowance for unusual runoffs of time deposits in october , when , according to news stories , there will be a bulge in maturing retail cds .
 the staff has no data to assess whether such a bulge will indeed occur .
 seasonally adjusted time deposits have not exhibited unusual volatility in past octobers relative to the ad- jacent months , nor did they last april when another bulge was said to be in train and time deposit rates had already decreased substan- tially .
 total reserves are projected to grow at an 8 percent annual rate from september to december .
 combined with a 7 percent growth of currency , the monetary base is anticipated to expand at a 7 percent annual rate .
 little . bank funding needs would be bolstered , cutting into the paydown of their managed liabilities .
 the contraction of thrift balance sheets , however , is likely to continue unabated in the fourth quarter , in association with sustained heavy rtc activity , assuming congressional appropriation of requested funding .
 large time deposits would still run off , albeit at a slower pace than over recent months , and m3 expansion would continue to be lower than growth of m2 .
 the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors under alternative b is projected to grow at a 6 - 1/2 percent annual rate from august to december , somewhat faster than the pace now estimated over july and august .
 the implied growth from the fourth quarter of 1990 of 5 - 1/4 percent to december would move this aggregate further into its 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 percent annual monitoring range .
 with the pickup in gnp expansion , nonfederal debt growth is projected to rise to around a 4 percent rate over the last four months of this year .
 the strengthening is expected in a number of components , though growth continues to be relatively sluggish , reflecting persisting credit supply restraint and high spreads of lending over borrowing rates at intermediaries .
 in the household sector , home mortgage debt growth strengthens a little through year - end in the forecast , as the recovery in housing sales remains subdued .
 consumer credit is expected to continue to contract , albeit at a slower rate .
 for businesses , issuance of long - term debt should be sustained if intermediate- and longer - term interest rates remain around current levels , while business loans at banks and commercial paper outstanding should fall noticeably less rapidly as inventory liquidation abates .",0,,N,,,0.0
20,1991-11-05," the easing contemplated in alternative a exceeds that now envisioned by the markets and thus money market interest rates would decline , perhaps by at least 1/4 percentage point .
 long - term rates , too , would come under some downward pressure , although declines would be muted if earlier market concerns about the stickiness of inflation reemerge at some point .
 the prime rate probably would be lowered 1/2 percentage point , still preserving the recently widened spread over funding costs .
 the dollar likely would fall somewhat on foreign exchange markets .
 m2 is projected to strengthen to a 4 percent rate by december under alternative a and would be entering the new year well into its tentative range .
 enlarged inflows to liquid deposits would boost both its nontransactions and m1 components , as sluggish deposit rates contribute to the attractiveness of such accounts .
 tending to limit the pickup in m2 , though , would be declines in rates on retail cds and money funds in relation to expected returns on capital market instruments ; also , cost pressures might induce more banks to overcome their hesitancy to lower rates on passbook and now accounts , which could prompt established customers to reconsider investment options and move account balances to market instruments .
 under alternative a , m3 would expand at a 1 - 1/4 percent rate in november and december , on a trajectory to begin the new year within its tentative range .
 buoying m3 would be heightened inflows to institution - only money market funds , whose holders would respond to the temporary improvement in their yields relative to those of money market instruments .
 in addition , banks ' needs for m3 liabilities would be raised by a little additional lending .
 improvement in some lending margins and firmer asset values would enhance access of many banks to capital and funding markets and encourage lending to some previously marginal credits .
 nevertheless , the major credit - market beneficiaries of the easing would continue to be those more highly rated credits having ready access to the commercial paper and capital markets .
 directive language :",-0.5," the markets appear to have built in a high probability of a further easing move in the period just ahead , and thus with the unchanged funds rate of alternative b , other market interest rates may tend to firm .
 the reversal in yields would be modest should incoming data on the real economy point more decisively to faltering near - term expansion , as in the staff forecast , engendering the expectation that the next easing has only been postponed .
 any rise in long - term yields also would be mitigated to the extent that indications of a softening in the economic outlook were seen as improving prospects for disinfla- tion .
 however , quality spreads on bank and corporate debt would widen marginally if the market 's economic outlook turns more downbeat .
 if rates do firm a little , the dollar could rise a bit on foreign ex- change markets .

 m2 would be expected to continue to expand at a 3 per- cent rate in the november and december period under alternative b , the same as expected at the october fomc meeting .
 the negative impact on m2 of the weaker picture for income and spending growth is likely to be about offset by the effects on opportunity costs of the most recent policy easing and by what promises to be a larger than previously expected slowdown in rtc resolution activity in the fourth quarter .
 in october , resolutions fell to a much reduced level that now seems likely to persist through year - end owing to legislative delays , which largely removes one restraining influence on retail deposits .
 growth of demand deposits , however , is expected to fall back from october 's atypical surge and show through to a slowing in m1 growth to a 7 - 1/4 percent pace over november and december.4   in the fourth quarter of this year , m2 expansion at a 2 percent rate on a quarterly average basis would imply a rise in its velocity of 1 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate , down markedly from the 4 - 1/2 percent pace of the third quarter .
 under this policy alternative , m2 would be on a trajectory to enter 1992 only a bit above the lower end of its tentative 1992 growth range of 2 - 1/2 to 6 - 1/2 percent .
 m3 under alternative b is seen as continuing to grow at a 1 percent annual rate over november and december , which would mean this aggregate would be entering next year around the bottom of its tentative 1992 range of 1 to 5 percent .
 despite the reduced projection for rtc activity , growth of m3 over the rest of the year is likely to be a little slower than expected at the last fomc meeting .
 the weaker outlook for m3 stems from our anticipation that the 4 . total reserves , currency , and the monetary base all are ex- pected to grow at rates of 8 to 9 percent over the last two months of the year .
 substitution of non - m3 liabilities for yankee cds at branches and agencies of foreign banks surfacing in october probably will persist to some degree .
 projected weakness in bank credit continues to damp the outlook for m3 .
 growth of c&i loans will be anemic owing to continued restraint by banks and , more important , to weak demand .
 business outlays for fixed capital and inventories are likely to be soft , and offerings in bond and equity markets should remain robust , as those firms that can access these markets seek to strengthen balance sheets .
 lending for commercial properties will remain depressed by sustained difficulties in this sector .
 household mort- gage growth will be restrained by the modest recovery in housing activity envisioned in the staff forecast .
 consumer credit should contract further over the remainder of the year , largely reflecting subdued spending on durables .
 in the aggregate , borrowing of domestic nonfederal sectors is expected to remain sluggish through year - end .
 in contrast , federal borrowing will stay brisk to finance a burgeoning deficit .
 overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to register a 5 percent rate of expansion over the september - to - december period , placing growth for the year about 1/2 percentage point above the bottom of the fomc 's 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 percent monitoring range for this aggregate .",0,,N,,,-0.25
21,1991-12-17,"-- although the former variant of alternative a , which involves funds trading 1/2 percentage point below the discount rate , would be technically possible , it likely would be associated with somewhat greater day - to - day volatility in the funds rate .
 under alternative a , the 1/2 percentage point fall in the funds rate to 4 percent would foster a smaller drop in other short - term interest rates , given the expectations of near - term policy easing al- ready incorporated in current market quotes .
 the three - month treasury bill rate would probably drop to around 4 percent or a bit below .
 the prime rate would be cut by 1/2 percentage point , preserving its current wide spread over funding costs .
 bond yields also probably would decline immediately , though by less than the drop in short rates . unless data were clear - cut in pointing to continuing weakness in the economy , the half - point easing of alternative a -- closely following the quarter - point decline in the funds rate last week -- would be seen as signalling a priority on encouraging a strong recovery .
 as a result , any reduction in inflation expectations would tend to be delayed .
 the exchange value of the dollar likely would extend its recent decline .
 the staff anticipates only modest decreases in foreign interest rates on average over coming months , as cost pressures in germany remain intense and german interest rates put a floor under rates in other ec countries .
-- even under the lower short - term inter- est rates associated with alternative a , these aggregates probably would remain noticeably below the midpoints of their ranges .
 the lower short - term interest rates associated with alternative a would put m2 on a path that would carry it toward the middle portion of its range later in 1992 .
 this impetus would be supplied in the first months of the year by lower opportunity costs of holding money , and later by the boost to income flows from the decline in interest rates .
 from november to march , m2 is projected to turn in a 3 - 3/4 percent growth rate under alternative a .
 the acceleration would be wholly concentrated in liquid deposits , which should respond to the narrowing of their opportunity costs .
 while deposit rates will be reduced further -- perhaps appreciably at some institutions , if lower market rates jolt them into reassessing long - standing rates on now accounts and passbook savings -- they are not likely to drop enough to eliminate the additional stimulus to money growth of the lower interest rates in alternative a . the induced pickup of inflows to liquid depos- its should more than offset greater outflows from small time deposits and m2-mmmf shares into capital market instruments with increasingly attractive relative returns .
 the faster m2 growth under alternative a will show through to m3 , though in muted form , since bank and thrift credit growth will accelerate by less than m2 in the short run .
 directive language",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , the federal funds rate would continue to center around 4 - 1/2 percent , in association with the allowance for ad- justment plus seasonal borrowing staying at $ 75
 under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b , interest rates may exhibit an initial tendency to firm a little , as market expectations of another modest policy easing in the near term are disappointed .
 if incoming data tend to confirm the staff 's forecast of some slippage in economic activity this winter , however , expectations of policy easings of the scope now contemplated by the market are likely to resurface , restoring the three - month treasury bill rate to around its current quote of 4.15 percent .
 similarly , the exchange value of the 3 .
 on january 9 , the rate on seasonal credit will begin to float with market interest rates , which presumably will affect the demand for such credit .
 in the past , seasonal credit has begun to rise in february .
 dollar could edge higher temporarily , but would probably end up trading around recent lower levels .
 bond yields could well move lower on bal- ance by early next year , as the market 's realization of the extent of economic sluggishness tends to reduce both real rates and inflationary expectations .
 however , any such bond market rally could be derailed if it looks as though a political consensus is emerging on measures for substantial fiscal stimulus ; the effects on bond yields would be especially adverse if it appeared that such measures would undermine the discipline in last year 's budget agreement intended to produce smaller deficits over time .
 announcement of a significant shift in treasury auctions away from longer - term notes and bonds and toward bills would precipitate some decline in bond rates and rise in bill rates -- judging from recent market reactions to such proposals .
-- under alternative b , both m2 and m3 are projected to be only somewhat above the lower edges of their tenta- tive 1992 target cones in march .
 under alternative b , both m2 and m3 are projected to grow a little more slowly than their average rates over october and november .
 m2 would be expected to post a 3 percent growth rate from november to march , and m3 a 1 - 1/2 percent rate .
 nominal income is projected to grow at about the same rates in the fourth and first quarters , and given the usual lags , the effects on money demand of the declines in interest rates through early december also would be roughly comparable in the two quarters .
 it is the resumption of rtc activity early next year that is responsible for the slight ebbing of m2 growth .
 restraint 4 .
 over the four months through march , m1 is expected to grow at a 10 - 1/2 percent rate , spurred by strong growth of transactions depos- its . required and total reserves are projected to advance at a 16 percent rate , while the monetary base expands at an 8 percent rate .
 this projection has made no allowance for an unwinding of an ongoing reserve avoidance practice involving now accounts and large time deposits , which would be disallowed under a proposed revision to regulation d to be considered by the board in january .
 the staff estimates that closing this loophole could add around 1 percentage point to growth in m1 over the first quarter .
 on m3 growth will be exerted not only by heavier rtc activity but also by a moderation in the expansion of bank credit and funding needs with the fading of special factors that have boosted bank lending recently .",0,,N,,,0.0
22,1992-03-31," the steepening yield curve for maturities out to two years and the pattern of futures market quotations suggest some firming of expectations that policy will tighten beginning later in the year .
 in this context , the unexpected easing of money market conditions of alternative a might cause a market reassessment of the intentions of the federal reserve , leading to a significant downward revision in the expected course of short - term interest rates for the next year or so .
 short - term rates would fall by about the 1/2 percentage point drop in the funds rate , and some intermediate - term rates might drop quite sub- stantially as well .
 effects on expected rates at longer
 horizons are more difficult to judge .
 in the absence of a worsening in the economic outlook , the easing might be interpreted as expansionary -- and poten- tially inflationary -- and short - term rates would be expected to rebound ultimately to even higher levels than market participants now antici- pate ; in this event , bond yields might drop relatively little , if at all .
 if the policy ease came to be seen as needed to counter threats to the expansion , however , arising perhaps from recent upward movements in long - term interest rates and exchange rates , the action could be viewed as promising lower short - term rates for a considerable period , and bond rates would move down appreciably .
 in either case , the dollar would fall .
 under the lower interest rates of alternative a , m2 is expected to grow at a 4 - 1/2 percent rate over the march - to - june period , keeping this aggregate around the midpoint of its 1992 target range .
 the decline in market rates would boost inflows to m1 accounts and money market mutual funds , although the still - lower return on retail balances in m2 relative to those seen on capital market instruments would again encourage some m2 holders to divert balances to the bond and equity markets .
 m3 would continue to grow at a 2 percent rate over the march- to - june period , remaining noticeably above the lower end of its range .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 4 percent in association with an initial bor- rowing allowance of $ 100 million .
 markets appear to anticipate no change in policy over the intermeeting period , and thus interest rates should remain close to current levels under alternative b . nevertheless , there could be a downward bias to rate movements over coming months .
 information on the economy consistent with the greenbook forecast may be somewhat more mixed than recent releases , and with aggregate price measures damped and money growth slower , expectations of future inflation and the likelihood of monetary tightening later in the year could be revised down .
 any tendency toward rate declines might be reinforced if the market became convinced that a fiscal stimulus package had been definitively ruled out .
 under these circumstances , the dollar could reverse some of its recent gains .
 absent an easing of reserve conditions , expansion in m2 and m3 is expected to be slower over the second quarter than over the first .
 projections for money growth over the march - to - june period under all three alternatives are given in the table below and on the table and charts on the following pages .
 under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b , m2 growth is projected to moderate to a 3 - 1/2 percent rate from march to june .
 leaving this aggregate below the midpoint of its annual range .
 although more rapid income growth would tend to boost demands for m2 at the relatively stable interest rates of this alternative , the lagged effects of the rise in market interest rates over the past few months will be restraining money growth relative to income .
 in addition , a number of the special factors boosting money growth in the alt .

 2 1 - 3/4 1 - 1/2 first quarter will no longer be at work , and in some cases their effects will be reversing .
 one such factor is the shifting of tax refunds into february from later months .
 another involves mortgage refinancing ; such activity already may have leveled out with depressing effects on growth of demand deposits , and refinancing could well decline subsequently in response to the rise in mortgage rates , causing currently swollen demand deposit accounts of mortgage servicers to be drawn down .
 the slowdown in m2 over the march - to - june period would be concentrated in the m1 component , which still is expected to expand at a 11 percent rate.8   given that opportunity costs on its more liquid 7 .
 projections of money growth are especially uncertain at this time of year owing to the massive payment flows associated with the april 15 tax date .
 changes in nonwithheld tax payments this year are projected to be well within the experience of recent years .
 thus , we are assuming that these flows are captured by existing seasonal factors .
 the cut in the reserve requirement on transaction deposits is expected to have little net effect on m1 .
 banks may bid slightly more aggressively for now accounts , but compensating balance requirements , which are usually calculated to incorporate the cost of reserve re- quirements , will be lower .
 the continued strength in transaction components results in projected growth over march to june in required and total reserves at rates of 13 - 1/2 and 14 - 3/4 percent , respectively , after adjusting for the effects of the change in reserve requirements .
 the monetary base would expand at a 7 - 1/2 percent rate .

 estimated level projected level 4.5 % 8.5 % components remain favorable , inflows to nontransaction m2 are expected to continue to be concentrated in savings deposits ( including mmdas ) , while sizable outflows from retail time deposits persist .
 as a consequence of rising opportunity costs and waning effects of special factors , m2 velocity is projected to increase sig- nificantly in the second quarter -- at about a 2 percent annual rate under alternative b . the modest deceleration of m2 embodied in this alterna-
 tive is expected to be consistent with the greenbook forecast of a con- tinued pickup in the economy .
 with credit flows concentrated in longer- term markets , depositories will remain fairly unaggressive bidders for deposits , and households will continue to direct savings to capital market instruments .
 in these circumstances , the staff is forecasting a 1 - 1/2 percent increase in m2 velocity over the four quarters of 1992 under the greenbook forecast , the same change in velocity as was fore- cast in february .
 for the year , m2 now would be expected to increase around 4 percent , a little faster than projected in february in line with stronger projected nominal gdp .
 growth in m3 under alternative b would moderate slightly to a 1 - 1/2 percent pace over the march - to - june period .
 in addition to weaker m2 growth , m3 money funds should be about unchanged over the second quarter under conditions of stable money market rates .
 on the other hand , deposit inflows at banks might firm as their asset growth strengthens a bit . with improving capital positions and better access to funding markets , banks might become a little more willing to hold the loans that they originate , rather than sell them .
 demands for
 commer- cial and industrial loans are likely to strengthen a little , as inven- tory liquidation abates .
 nonetheless , businesses are expected to con- tinue to concentrate much of their financing in bond and equity markets as they repair balance sheets .
 net mortgage borrowing by households is expected to rise , accompanying the recovery in housing activity , with the bulk of these funds coming from the open market through mortgage securities .
 indebtedness of the nonfederal sectors should grow a little faster over the march - to - june period , but , at only a 3 percent annual rate of expansion , will remain quite anemic .
 federal debt , in contrast , will accelerate noticeably , boosting overall debt growth to a 6 percent pace over the second quarter and lifting the debt aggregate to within its 1992 monitoring range at quarter - end .",0," the tightening of policy under alternative c would lead to about a 50 basis point rise in money market rates , which likely would be passed through fully to the prime rate .
 long - term rates also would rise and the dollar would firm , especially if the federal reserve 's action were taken as confirming views that a robust expansion was well established with inflationary potential .
 on the other hand , to the extent that market participants saw the early move as improving pros- pects for disinflation or that the action would be reversed quickly because it risked undermining an acceptable economic recovery , effects on bond yields would be limited .
 m2 growth would slacken to a 2 - 1/2 percent rate over the march - to - june period under alternative c , bringing this aggregate ap- preciably below the midpoint of its annual range .
 much of the slowing would be in its m1 component .
 in the context of a somewhat more uncer- tain outlook for the recovery , bankers might remain highly cautious lenders and continue to hold their balance sheets in check ; sluggish bank credit growth and likely runoffs of m3 money funds would imply m3 growth of only 1 percent at an annual rate over the march - to - june period .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
23,1992-05-19," the extent of the easing of reserve market conditions under alternative a would catch market participants unawares , and the 1/2 point drop in the federal funds rate would induce a nearly compar- able decline in other money market interest rates .
 commercial banks are likely to pass through the funds - rate reduction fully to the prime rate , while retaining a relatively wide spread over costs of funds .
 recent declines in long - term rates , occurring as markets were beginning to build in a possible easing , suggest that a decrease in bond yields might accompany such an action .
 however , following an easing move , especially of the dimensions of alternative a , investors would become more assured of sustained economic expansion , but also less confident of any longer - term decrease in inflation , which together would limit any reductions in long - term rates .
 with interest rates on dollar - denomi- nated securities becoming less attractive relative to returns abroad , the exchange value of the dollar would adjust downward .
-- if the lower funds rate of alternative a is maintained through year - end , growth of m2 for the year could be expected to come in around 4 percent .",-0.5,"-- the same federal funds rate could be achieved by cutting the discount rate 1/2 percentage point to 3 percent and specifying borrowing at the alternative b level of $ 100 million .
 although market participants apparently view the prospects for the next policy action as more heavily favoring an easing than a tightening , no immediate policy change seems to remain the predominant view .
 consequently , prices in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets probably would not show much reaction should the committee main- tain current reserve market conditions by choosing alternative b at this meeting .
 economic expansion along the lines projected in the greenbook and money growth remaining near the lower end of the committee 's range ( discussed below ) are likely to continue to foster some downward bias in 4 . upward technical adjustments to the borrowing assumption may be required to allow for some continued uptrend in seasonal borrowing during the spring ; the extent of such adjustments will be limited by the new market - based rate on such credit .
 market expectations for reserve market pressures for a time .
 maintain- ing unchanged conditions over the entire intermeeting period eventually could cause some short - term rates to edge higher and dollar exchange rates to strengthen a little as markets reassessed the federal reserve 's intentions .
 however , long - term yields are likely to remain fairly steady or possibly even edge down as expectations for growth and infla- tion are trimmed back ; the passage of an effective balanced budget amendment would add to downward pressures on long - term rates .
 growth of m2 is projected to average 2 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate over may and june with the essentially stable money market interest rates of alternative b . most of the pickup should stem from the liquid components , as outflows to cover tax payments prove to be smaller than implicitly anticipated by seasonal factors .
 in particular , ml is likely to return to a double - digit pace over may and june , led by a sharp reacceleration of demand and other checkable deposits .
 even so , m2 growth from march to june would be only 1 percent , as would its growth on a quarterly - average basis , far below the staff 's projected pace of 5 percent for nominal gdp .
 the staff believes that m2 velocity will continue to increase in coming quarters but at a much slower rate as the unusual factors inducing the current quarter 's increase in m2 velocity wane .
 for the year as a whole , v2 is projected to be up about 2 percent in association with annual m2 growth of 3 - 1/2 percent .
 5 . adjusted for the change in reserve requirements , total reserves and the monetary base would grow by 10 - 1/4 and 7 - 3/4 percent , respec- tively , over may and june .

 under alternative b , the projected turnaround in m2 over may and june should show through to m3 , which is expected to register an annual growth rate of 1 - 3/4 percent ; from march to june , m3 would be about unchanged .
 the slower expansion of m3 than of m2 would reflect continued runoffs of large time deposits , as net credit extension at depositories lags behind inflows to retail deposits .
 the decline of business loans at banks might moderate as inventory liquidation slows and banks become more willing to lend , especially to smaller businesses .
 however , business credit demands are expected to be restrained overall , as projected cash flow about matches capital spending , and to remain focused on longer - term markets .
 the modest projected rise in spending for new homes and durable goods , together with continuing cautious attitudes toward debt , should limit household borrowing as well .
 conse- quently
 , growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to con- tinue at only a 2 - 3/4 percent annual rate from march to june .
 federal debt , by contrast , is expected to post a more rapid 13 percent rate of growth over these three months .

24,1992-08-18," under alternative a , short - term interest rates would fall by nearly the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate , espe-
 cially were the easing to take the form of a discount rate cut , which 3 .
 the borrowing allowance likely will need to be reduced in late september to reflect the usual fall - off in demands for seasonal credit . would be seen as implying that the reduction more likely would be sus- tained .
 banks would be expected to trim another 1/2 percentage point off the prime rate , still preserving large spreads over funding costs .
 some market participants might read the easing as increased emphasis on spurring economic activity , at the cost of limiting progress against inflation .
 nonetheless , given the outlook for tepid economic expansion and slower inflation that recently has come to be more firmly embedded in market expectations , nominal as well as real bond yields would be likely to decline noticeably .
 easing in the united states might lessen constraints on more expansive monetary policies in a few other coun- tries , but with many countries , especially in europe , highly unlikely to follow suit , the dollar would tend to depreciate significantly further .
 growth rates of the monetary aggregates under the three alternatives are presented below .
 the table gives projected money growth rates through year - end , on the assumption that the contemplated reserve conditions under each alternative are maintained over that period .
 growth rates for m2 and m3 are projected to be quite subdued .
 for the june - to - september period , expansion in the broad aggregates is likely to fall well short of the rates envisioned at the time of the last committee meeting , even if alternative a is adopted .
 moreover , growth of m2 and m3 over the rest of the year would remain damped , leaving these aggregates below their annual target ranges under all the alternatives.4   ml , on the other hand , is likely to expand at a double - digit pace over coming months , boosted by mortgage prepayments , low time deposit rates , and special factors.5 alt .

 the lower interest rates of alternative a would be expected to buoy money growth over the balance of the year .
 although there is some question about the strength of the near - term response of m2 to lower short - term rates , the anticipated decline in long - term rates under this alternative should damp additional adverse yield curve effects .
 over time , the lower real and nominal interest rates would raise income growth and , through that channel , further augment demands for money , though the effects through year - end would be small .
 the slightly faster growth in m2 deposits would feed through partly to m3 , as would relatively more attractive rates on m3 money funds , leading to a resumption of 1 percent expansion in this aggregate over the balance of the year .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 - 1/4 percent in combination with an initial allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 250 million.3 under alterna-
 market sentiment of late seems to have tilted toward some prospect of another policy ease in coming months .
 although money market interest rates might firm a bit over the intermeeting period under the unchanged policy of alternative b , any increase would be limited if , consistent with the greenbook forecast , information continued to suggest modest economic expansion .
 bond rates also should remain around their current reduced levels , and could even edge down if inaction by the federal reserve , along with indicators of wages and prices , were seen as reinforcing disinflationary trends . if political dynamics seem to portend even higher budget deficits ahead , these downward pressures on bond yields may tend to be offset .
 the dollar , under alternative b , would be expected to trade around its recent lower levels .
 under alternative b , m2 is expected to resume expanding this month and to grow at a 2 - 1/4 percent pace on balance over the remainder of the year .
 m2 growth will be supported by large inflows to demand deposits in the months ahead , owing to the resumption of strong mortgage refinancing activity and a buildup in compensating balances occasioned by recent declines in market rates .
 with flows into ocds also strong , ml is projected to expand at a 10 percent pace over the balance of the year .
 beyond ml , outflows from m2 money funds are projected to abate , although the very steep yield curve is expected to continue to draw balances from such accounts and
 6 . actual growth in the fourth quarter will be boosted relative to expectations at the last meeting effects .
 7 . nearly half of the growth in m2 over the balance of the year is projected to come from increases in demand deposits and mmdas associ- ated with mortgage prepayments .
 total reserves and the monetary base would be expected to in- crease at around a 10 percent pace over june to december .
 from retail time deposits to capital market investments .
 on a quar- terly average basis , m2 would contract slightly this quarter , and increase at a 2 - 1/4 percent rate in the fourth quarter .
 this projec- tion assumes the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b ex- tended through year - end and the greenbook economic forecast .
 it im- plies
 velocity growth at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter and 3 - 1/4 percent in the fourth .
 with the assumed income and interest rates , standard money demand models predict velocity decreases through this period ; experimental models that embody yield - curve effects and other alternative measures of opportunity costs are predicting veloc- ity increases in the second half of the year , though not as large as embodied in the staff forecast .
 the firming in m2 under alternative b shows through in part to m3 , which bottoms out in coming months and then edges higher .
 acting to limit any pickup in this aggregate is the likelihood of anemic advances in bank credit and funding needs and some further declines in thrift credit .
 the failure of m3 to grow this year , as implied in all the alternatives , would be unprecedented in the official series , which begins in 1959 .
 the extraordinary behavior of m3 is a function not only of weak depository credit but of restrained credit growth overall .
 with spending financed out of higher profits and by drawing down liquid assets , the debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to expand at only a 2 - 3/4 percent pace over the balance of the year , implying a further drop in debt - to - income ratios for both households and businesses .
 continued strong federal borrowing will boost total debt growth to 4 - 3/4 percent for the year -- near the lower end of its annual monitoring range .",0," a reversal of the july easing would take market partici- pants completely by surprise and short - term interest rates would rise by at least 1/2 percentage point under alternative c . bond rates , too , would retrace some of their recent declines under this alternative , at least initially , and quality spreads on private debt could widen if such a tightening were seen as placing the recovery at risk .
 the dollar would rebound appreciably .
 under alternative c , m2 and m3 would drop further below their annual ranges , as opportunity costs widen , banks become even more cautious lenders , and income growth is more restrained .
 the effects on m1 would be especially marked in the fourth quarter , given the drop in mortgage prepayments that would accompany the backup in long - term rates .
 still , m1 would be expected to increase at a 10 per- cent rate from june to december .
 directive language",0.5,,,0.0
25,1992-10-06,"-- under the easier policy stance of alternative a , the expected federal funds rate would be cut to 2 - 1/2 percent .
-- with a 1/2 percentage point drop in the dis- count rate , for example , an initial borrowing assumption of $ 200 million would be retained under alternative a .
 the immediate 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal funds rate under alternative a would exceed the market 's expected change .
 short - term market interest rates would decline by as much as 1/4 point further , and banks would reduce the prime rate by 1/2 point , maintaining an unusually wide spread over funding costs .
 the dollar probably would depreciate somewhat further ; since the policy easing would occur in a situation of persistent macroeconomic slack and ongo- ing disinflation , the decline in the dollar is most likely to be con- tained .
 in such circumstances , long - term market rates probably would move still lower , pulled down by the weight of a reduced expected path for short - term rates over at least the intermediate term .
-- ( 15 ) under alternative a , m2 and m3 likely would grow at rates of 2 - 3/4 and 1 - 1/4 percent over the september - to - december interval .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent , in association with an initial assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
 the spate of weak incoming economic information since late last week has reestablished market expectations that another easing of reserve conditions may well be imminent , involving an an- ticipated further decline in the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point .
 under these circumstances , selection of the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b would initially induce some backup in interest rates across the maturity spectrum and some rise in the ex- change value of the dollar .
 this upward pressure would be muted to the extent that market participants viewed any policy action as merely 5 . to attain the lower bounds of their annual ranges , m2 and m3 would need to grow by 5 and 3 - 1/4 percent , respectively , from septem- ber to december .

 the market 's expectations of an eventual ease would be strengthened should incoming data confirm the tepid expansion and disinflationary trends in the greenbook forecast .
 that forecast en- compasses the possibility of some decline in short - term rates over coming months , but keeping the funds rate at 3 percent over the six weeks of the intermeeting period would not necessarily be inconsistent with that possibility .
 in any event , a decline in long - term rates could eventually develop even at an unchanged funds rate as evidence of disinflation takes firm enough hold to offset skittishness about fiscal policy ; indeed , failing to meet market expectations about policy easing could well strengthen perceptions that the disinflation trend will be sustained .
 under alternative b , m2 is projected to grow at a 2 percent rate from september to december , somewhat slower than in the last two months .
 monetary growth will be boosted for a time by addi- tions to demand deposits associated with prepayments on mortgage- backed securities arising from robust refinancings and to ocds from the reclassification of sweep accounts however , nominal income growth is projected to moderate in the fourth quarter .
 moreover , despite the special factors and lingering effects of pre- vious policy stimulus , projected m2 growth stays below that of nominal gdp because of the probable persistence of the forces that have been boosting m2 velocity for some time .
 in particular , the further de- clines in liquid deposit rates in prospect , in combination with a still steep treasury yield curve , will continue to encourage shifts into bond and stock mutual funds from m2 balances .
 in addition , the 6 . about $ 4 - 1/2 billion of such accounts , which have been clas- sified as large time deposits since their introduction in july 1990 , will be reclassified as transaction deposits at the end of october .
 ml as a whole is expected to record a 12 - 1/2 percent rate of growth from september to december .
 with currency and total reserves growth projected at 9 - 1/2 and 17 - 1/2 percent , respectively , over these three months , the monetary base would expand at an 11 percent rate .
 gap between consumer loan rates and deposit rates will stay wide by historical standards , tending to foster a further rechannelling of funds away from m2 and toward household debt repayment or avoidance .
 the growth in m2 velocity in the fourth quarter of nearly 1 percent would bring its expansion over this year to 2 - 1/2 percent .
 were the federal funds rate to be maintained at 3 percent beyond the committee meeting in november , m2 growth in the first quarter
 probably would be on a trajectory below the committee 's tentative 2 - 1/2 to 6 - 1/2 percent range , with continued sizeable velocity increases .",0,,N,,,0.0
26,1992-11-17," two alternatives for money and debt growth ranges are shown below for 1993 , along with the staff projections .
 the alternative a ranges represent the current provisional ranges announced last july ; the lower ends of these ranges are above the staff forecasts for broad money growth .
 alternative
 ii ranges are 1 percentage point lower for m2 and m3 and encompass the staff forecasts for these aggregates .

-- or the committee could put some emphasis on m2 and still select alternative a if the greenbook forecast were viewed as involving unacceptably weak economic activity and unnecessarily rapid disinflation .
-- the policy ease envisaged under alternative a would trim the expected federal funds rate to 2 - 1/2 percent .
-- technically , though , the lower federal funds rate of alternative a could be achieved by reducing the borrowing assumption $ 25 million with an unchanged discount rate .
 against a backdrop of public readings that suggested some firming in economic activity , market participants would be sur- prised by the 1/2 point decline in the funds rate under alternative a . most short - term interest rates would match the decrease in the federal funds rate .
 major commercial banks would take that cue , cutting the prime rate 1/2 percentage point ; even with a 5 - 1/2 percent prime rate , banks still would enjoy a swollen margin over funding costs , at least in comparison to the historical record .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline .
 long - term interest rates are likely to drop , reversing much of the recent runup .
 such a decline would be limited , however , should the easing engender market fears that the lagged effects of the monetary stimulus , reinforcing a boost provided by a prospective fiscal policy package in 1993 , would undercut the downward tilt to in- flation .
 while the impetus to the monetary aggregates imparted by choosing alternative a would be barely discernible in 1992 , the lower market interest rates embodied in that choice would push up both m2 and m3 to the lower end of their current tentative ranges for 1993 by march .
 the anticipated drop in nominal interest rates across the term structure should speed balance - sheet adjustments , lowering debt service burdens for households and corporations , and by reducing real rates as well , provide some spur to spending .
 directive language",-0.5,"-- ( 12 )  the lower ranges embodied in alternative b might be chosen on the rationale that since july experience with substantial further increases in velocities and additional analysis have reduced the uncertainty regarding the strength of the forces acting to boost veloci- ties in 1993 .
-- accordingly , even if the projected relationship among money demand , spending , and interest rates foreseen by the staff proves to be correct , the lower portions of the current ranges still could be seen as representing appropriate intermediate targets for m2 and m3 growth next year , more so than the lower portions of the alternative b ranges .
-- under alternative b , the trading range for the federal funds rate would remain centered at 3 percent , in conjunction with an initial assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 75 mil-
 the absence of system action over the current intermeet- ing period and the flow of data releases pointing more clearly to sus- tained expansion in economic activity have solidified the notion that monetary policy will remain unchanged for some time .
 thus , market par- ticipants would be unlikely to react to the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b , especially if incoming data conform to the greenbook assessment of moderately expanding real activity in the fourth quarter .
 treasury bill rates would hold at their current levels , as would the 7 . to attain the lower bounds of their target ranges by december , m2 and m3 would need to grow at average rates of 4 - 1/4 and 4 percent , respectively , in november and december .

 private money market rates , however , may rise should skittishness about the availability of funds at year - end intensify .
 as the december 19 date for implementation of prompt corrective action approaches , pres- sures on quality spreads in the banking sector might be exacerbated by uncertainty about the circle of candidates subject to early closure .
 in capital markets , yields could edge down on balance as the readings that trickle in over the intermeeting period indicate a modest pace to the economic expansion and imply further progress toward price stability .
 at the same time , concerns about the prospects for fiscal stimulus and uncertainties about the economic policies of the new administration more generally , which may not be resolved for some time , will continue to weigh upon market sentiment .
 under alternative b , the growth of m2 is projected to slow somewhat from its pace of the last two months .
 special factors are continuing to boost m2 growth in november but will partly reverse there- after , pulling average growth over the five month forecast horizon back to an underlying rate of about 2 percent .
 on a quarterly average basis , the near - term pickup in m2 puts that aggregate on a growth tra- jectory somewhat below that for nominal gdp in the fourth quarter but 8 .
 additions to demand deposits and mmdas to support mortgage refinancings account for about $ 4 billion of the increase in m2 from october to december , but the anticipated contraction in mortgage refinancing activity subtracts a like amount from the change in that aggregate over the december - to - march period .
 the reclassification of sweep accounts as other checkable rather than large time deposits adds about $ 4 billion to m2 from october to december but has no further effect .
 m1 growth is slowing , but the lagged effects of previous reductions in short - term market interest rates still show clearly in the projected near double - digit expansion of the narrow aggregates . with currency and total reserves projected at 7 - 3/4 and 6 percent , respectively , over these five months , the monetary base would increase at an 8 percent rate .
 about 3 percentage points below it in the first quarter of 1993 .
 this upward tilt to m2 velocity over the two quarters reflects a continuation of those forces that have been boosting velocity for some time -- the ongoing process of balance - sheet restructuring and deleveraging that makes investors less willing to acquire monetary assets and depository institutions less willing to compete aggressively for funds .",0,,N,,,0.0
27,1992-12-22,"-- ( seasonal borrowing ordinarily would be expected to edge down in january , but with such borrowing already at a very low level of about $ 20 million , little change is likely over the intermeeting period . ) alternative a incor- porates a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate .
 the 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds rate under alternative a would be passed through fully to other short - term interest rates .
 the three - month treasury bill rate would drop into the 2 - 3/4 percent area , or a bit below , and the prime rate would be reduced to 5 - 1/2 percent .
 market expectations about the trajectory of interest rates over the next few months would be marked down , but anticipations that the easing move might need to be reversed before much time had passed -- especially in the context of possible fiscal stimulus -- would limit declines in longer - term rates .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar could drop noticeably , although in present circumstances , foreign central banks might ease their own policies somewhat sooner than they are likely to otherwise , muting the dollar 's decline .
-- ( 13 ) the lower interest rates of alternative a would boost m2 growth well into 1993 , putting this aggregate near the lower end of the current provisional range by march .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent , in association with the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing remaining at $ 50 million .
 in view of the stronger tone of economic data in recent weeks , market participants seem to be anticipating a firming in the stance of monetary policy some time next year , but likely not between now and the early february fomc meeting .
 with an unchanged federal funds rate under alternative b , other private short - term rates will decline over the intermeeting period as remaining year - end pressures unwind .
 apart from year - end effects , rates along the maturity spectrum might tend to drift lower should developments unfold as in the staff forecast ; in these circumstances , expectations of substantial policy tightening in 1993 are likely to fade , albeit slowly , as inflation re- mains subdued and the pace of expansion stays moderate .
 intermediate- and
 longer - term rates may be importantly influenced by new proposals on fiscal policy .
 markets apparently are anticipating some modest fiscal stimulus , but there is considerable uncertainty about the size of any short - term package and the scope and credibility of proposals for longer - term deficit reduction .
 interest rates could also be affected by discussions of other policy measures apparently being considered by the new administration , which also have not been assumed in the staff fore- cast .
 for example , efforts to increase bank lending by relaxing regula- tions , intended to ease the cost and availability of credit to borrowers dependent on banks , might boost some market interest rates if such a relaxation were seen as having a significant impact on spending and as shifting bank portfolios toward loans and away from government securities .
 proposals to put greater emphasis on shorter maturities in treasury debt management , while motivated primarily by possible saving in federal interest expense , may flatten the yield curve a little .
 m3 is expected to be unchanged on balance over the november - to - march period under the reserve market conditions of alternative b , as a decline that appears to be in train in december offsets sluggish growth over the following three months .
 restraint on balance- sheet growth by depository institutions and slack demands for loans at banks and thrifts will continue to stunt the growth of this aggregate .
 around year - end , certain bank liabilities , including large time depos- its , could decline noticeably , as banks seek to minimize deposit in-
 surance charges and capital requirements , but such maneuvers in them- selves should have little effect on growth over the november - to - march period .
 growth would be about 3/4 percentage point below its tenta- tive 1 to 5 percent target range in march .
-- much of the higher money growth over coming months relative to alternative b would reflect stronger expansion of m1 .
-- with issuance of managed liabilities weak , growth in m3 would be boosted only slightly as compared with alternative b , and that aggregate would remain below its provisional target range in march .",0,"-- the 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c could be implemented by raising the borrowing allowance by $ 25 million .
 m2 is projected to expand at only a 1 percent rate from november - to - march under alternative c and m3 would decline at a 1/4 percent rate .
 m1 growth would be limited to 4 percent over november - to- march by the higher opportunity costs of demand deposits and now ac- counts under this alternative .
 losses on capital market instruments as long - term rates rise could limit flows into bond and stock mutual funds , cushioning the restraining effect on m2 and m3 .
 still , m2 would be just 1 - 1/4 percent above its fourth - quarter base by march .

28,1993-03-23,"-- under alternative a , the federal funds rate would decline to the 2 - 1/2 percent area .
-- ( 9 ) the easing of policy under alternative a would surprise market participants and would lead to a decline in short - term rates , including the prime rate , commensurate with the 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal funds rate .
-- ( 14 ) under alternative a , m2 would strengthen to a 3 percent rate over the february - to - june period .
-- m3 would grow at a 1 - 1/4 percent pace over february to june under alternative a , but would remain below its fourth - quarter base even by june .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent in association with the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially remaining at $ 50 million .
 market participants are expecting neither tightening nor easing in the stance of monetary policy for some time .
 they appear to anticipate that the recent runup in inflation will subside in large part .
 the gains in stock prices and sustained narrow quality spreads suggest that investors now also believe that the bond market rally , together with the economy 's existing forward momentum , will keep the contractionary effects of the deficit - reduction package from derailing the economic expansion .
 thus , under alternative b , short - term interest rates would stay around current levels .
 intermediate- and long - term rates will remain sensitive to news on the fiscal front and
 correspond- ing implications for the economy , as well as reports bearing on the inflation outlook .
 bond rates could edge lower should incoming news on prices confirm the extent of moderation in inflation embodied in the staff economic forecast .
 the dollar would be expected to fluctuate around current levels under alternative b , but could firm somewhat if rate declines in europe prove to be faster and larger than now expected .
 under alternative b , m2 is expected to resume growth over the february - to - june period .
 the projected 2 - 1/2 percent average rate implies growth of 1 - 3/4 percent for the second quarter .
 with nominal gdp in the staff forecast decelerating to a 5 - 1/2 percent pace , growth in m2 velocity would slow to a 3 - 1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter .
 slower velocity growth partly results from the positive ef- fects on m2 of the turnaround of the temporary factors related to sea- sonal adjustment and prepayments of mortgage - backed securities .
 their impact , which represents a diminishing drag on m2 growth in march as a whole , acts as a stimulant to growth in the subsequent months ,
 reflect- ing a reversal of the effects of seasonal distortions and a resurgence in prepayments.4 on balance , these factors raise money growth per- ceptibly over the february - to - june period .
 much of the pickup in m2 comes from its m1 component , which would expand at a 10 percent annual 4 . still another factor , related to depressed individual refunds and elevated individual nonwithheld tax payments , is expected to re- strain m2 growth in march and may and boost it in april and june , but to have a negligible effect over the february - to - june period as a whole .

 by june , growth in m2 from its fourth - quarter base would be only 1/2 percent at an annual rate .",0,,0.5,,,0.0
29,1993-05-18," the 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative a would surprise market participants and should show through almost completely to other short - term interest rates .
 the three - month bill rate would fall to around 2 - 1/2 percent , and the prime rate probably would be reduced to 5 - 1/2 percent .
 with the economy likely to exhibit a bit more strength than otherwise over the inter- mediate run as a result of the easing , banks may feel a little more confident about the ability of borrowers to repay loans .
 as a result , banks might further ease other terms and standards on lending .
 risk premiums in short- and long - term market interest rates , already histori- cally narrow , would probably remain around their current levels .
 any initial decline in longer - term yields could be limited by concerns that the easier monetary policy stance indicated more emphasis on supporting the economic expansion and less emphasis on containing inflation , par- ticularly against the backdrop of the recent disappointing wage and price behavior and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal policy debate .
 absent corresponding actions abroad to ease monetary policy , downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar would resume .
 the lower interest rates of alternative a would be ex- pected to provide some added lift to growth of the monetary aggregates .
 banks and thrifts , while continuing to price their deposits unaggres- sively , likely would not immediately match the downward movement in market rates .
 yields on money market mutual funds , likewise , would lag the decline in market rates .
 the lower opportunity costs of deposits and money funds relative to short - term market rates should provide a small boost to the aggregates , even though attractive yields would continue to induce heavy inflows into bond and stock mutual funds .
 m2 growth over may and june would come in at about a 6 percent rate , with much of the additional strength resulting from its m1 component .
 m3 would expand at a 4 - 1/4 percent rate .
 despite the more rapid growth , both of the broad monetary aggregates would remain well below their annual ranges in june .
 m2 growth is projected to post a 2 - 3/4 percent pace from june to september , bringing the rate of expansion for the april to september period to 4 percent .
 even with the lower interest rates and consequent economic stimulus of this alternative later in the year , m2 would be unlikely to reach the lower end of its annual range by the fourth quarter .",-0.5," in light of recent price reports , market participants now generally seem to expect that the next change in the stance of monetary policy is somewhat more likely to be toward tightening than toward ease , but few appear to anticipate any move immediately after the may fomc meeting .
 thus , market interest rates are unlikely to react to the implementation of alternative b . the odds are that bond yields will retrace at least some of their recent back - up if -- as anticipated in the greenbook forecast -- the news on inflationary pressures proves more favorable .
 the ongoing budget debates and the prospective announcement of the administration 's health reform plan suggest that the volatility associated with an uncertain fiscal outlook may persist .
 shorter - term rates could rise some with the approach of larger auction volumes of bills and shorter - term notes .
 the value of the dollar on foreign 5 .
 further increases in the allowance for borrowing likely will be needed over the intermeeting period to account for expected growth in the demand for seasonal credit during the late spring .
 exchange markets probably would remain around current levels under alternative b .
 under alternative b , m2 is projected to increase at about a 5 - 3/4 percent average rate over may and june , a considerable pickup from recent months.6
 some of the strength in may , and to a lesser extent in june , reflects reversals of previous temporary depressants involving tax effects , the late - winter lull in mortgage refinancing activity , and seasonal - adjustment distortions.7 apart from effects of these temporary factors , underlying m2 probably will exhibit a speed- up over the two months , owing to an abatement of the more fundamental influences that had boosted its velocity to a 5 - 3/4 percent growth rate over the previous two quarters .
 quarterly average growth of m2 for the second quarter is projected at about a 1 - 1/2 percent rate , with temporary factors having little net impact .
 thus , with nominal gdp expected to rise at about a 4 - 1/4 percent rate , m2 velocity would increase at only about a 2 - 1/2 percent pace .
 if the money market condi- tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer , m2 growth would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal gdp in the third quarter .
 m3 under alternative b is seen as accelerating to about a 4 percent rate over may and june .
 this speedup would stem solely from the pickup in m2 , as managed liabilities in m3 , including large time deposits , should resume running off over the two months .
 bank credit expansion is expected to remain moderate , with loan growth quite weak , 6 . m1 is projected to rise at an 18 percent annual rate from april to june .
 the expansion in m1 deposits should show through in rapid growth in required reserves , and total reserves would be expected to expand at a 19 - 1/4 percent annual rate from april to june .
 with currency growth anticipated at 11 percent over the two months , the monetary base would rise at an 11 - 1/4 percent pace .
 this year 's seasonal adjustment factors for february and march appear to be elevated artificially by the influence of system easing actions around year - end 1990 and 1991 rather than evolving seasonal patterns .
 and the balance sheets of thrift institutions are anticipated to con- tinue to contract .
 while inflows of core deposits are projected to meet most of the added funding needs of banks and s&ls , banks are likely to obtain some funding from abroad and from other nondeposit sources , in part to avoid higher deposit insurance premiums .
 looking further ahead , moderate average growth of m3 during the third quarter would be expected to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative b over that period .
 households and businesses are expected to stay cautious in using credit in coming months .
 in the household sector , mortgage refinancing activity is likely to remain brisk .
 overall mortgage debt , however , is expected to expand at about its first - quarter pace , as cash- out refinancing activity continues to be limited and home purchases rise only gradually .
 growth of consumer credit is projected to remain moderate , despite heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other incentives .
 given still - favorable conditions in longer - term markets under alternative b , issuance of corporate bonds and stocks should remain relatively heavy .
 with the shortfall of internal funds relative to capital expenditures remaining small , businesses are likely to con- tinue to use the proceeds of securities issuance to pay down higher - cost bonds and bank loans .
 treasury borrowing should pick up in coming months to finance a widening deficit , with more issuance in the shorter end of the market , reflecting the recent shift in debt management policy .
 domestic nonfinancial debt would be expected to move further above the lower edge of its 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 percent monitoring range through june .",0,"-- federal funds would trade in the neighborhood of 3 - 1/2 percent under alternative c , in association with an initial borrowing allowance of $ 125 million .
 market participants also would be surprised by the policy tightening under alternative c at this fomc meeting .
 bond yields may well increase , but with the rise probably tempered by the sense that the federal reserve was moving promptly to head off a resurgence of infla- tion .
 bill rates likely would jump by nearly the increase of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate , and private money market rates could rise a bit more , reflecting widening risk premiums .
 banks would likely boost the prime rate by 1/2 percentage point .
 bank stock prices , which have benefited from wide spreads between short - term deposit rates and rates on longer - term assets , likely would extend their recent declines .
 overall stock price indexes probably would drop as well , and the result- ing capital losses on bonds and stocks could restrain inflows to long- term mutual funds , at least temporarily .
 the dollar would strengthen on foreign exchange markets .

 under alternative c , the higher money market interest rates and opportunity costs would restrain the monetary aggregates .
 the restraint on the aggregates could be limited to the degree that capital losses on bond and stock funds prompt investors to shift back into deposits , but on balance the tighter monetary stance should act to slow monetary growth .
 m2 would expand at only a 5 - 1/2 percent rate over may and june , and m3 at a 3 - 3/4 percent pace .
 the moderate upward trajec- tory of m2 expected under unchanged interest rates later in the year would be trimmed , with growth from june to september likely at only a 1 - 1/2 percent rate ; and m2 would finish the year well below its target range .
 maintenance of the money market conditions of alternative c probably would induce m3 to contract on the year .

30,1993-08-17," the easing under alternative a would come as a surprise to market participants , and short - term rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the funds rate .
 intermediate - term rates would decrease noticeably , and longer - term rates also would move lower , at least in the immediate aftermath of the easing action .
 the fall in longer - term nominal interest rates might be limited if inflation expec- tations were worsened by a sense that the federal reserve was putting less weight on its longer - run price stability objective .
 even if longer - term nominal rates were little affected , real rates across the maturity structure would fall .
 however , unless the easing itself prompted a more downbeat market assessment of the underlying strength of spending , the drop in real capital market rates might be muted to some extent by questions about how long the reduced federal funds rate could be sustained , given its already low level in real terms .
-- ( 12 ) in light of the likelihood of some decline in an array of real interest rates , as well as the real foreign exchange value of the dollar , alternative a might be favored if economic growth in the staff forecast were seen to be unsatisfactory and the committee were willing to accept little or no further disinflation . or this option might appear attractive if the risks to the staff forecast were seen to be tilted significantly toward the downside , especially in view of con- tinued fiscal drag .
-- m3 under alternative a would expand slowly over the final four months of the year as bank credit growth remained damped in the context of continued heavy financing in the securities markets .",-0.5," market participants are not expecting a change in policy over the relatively short upcoming intermeeting period .
 thus , under alternative b , short - term interest rates should remain around current levels in the weeks ahead .
 the prime rate , at 6 percent , is unlikely to move , as banks ' increased willingness to lend will probably take the form of narrower spreads relative to benchmark rates and more attractive nonprice terms .
 although the passage of the deficit reduction package has removed one element of uncertainty , questions remain about its effects , suggesting that rates could be quite sensitive to information bearing on household and business spending .
 currently , market partici- pants appear to be anticipating a tightening of monetary policy by early next year , on the presumption that short - term rates will have to move up to forestall any incipient buildup of inflation pressures .
 given these expectations , intermediate- and perhaps long - term rates could drift lower if , in line with the staff economic forecast , incoming indicators point to more subdued spending and inflationary pressures than now seem 5 .
 the flood in the mississippi river basin and its aftermath are expected to have little effect on discount window borrowing .
 built into market expectations ; in such circumstances , market partici- pants would likely see tightening actions as being pushed further into the future .
 the dollar should trade around recent levels on foreign exchange markets , with any downward pressure from possible declines in u.s .
 interest rates being balanced by projected reductions in rates abroad .
 the interest rates under alternative b are consistent with those of the staff greenbook forecast , which has the federal funds rate around current levels through 1994 and long - term rates edging lower .
 in that forecast , persistent low levels of real short - term interest rates are needed to counter fiscal drag and other impediments to economic growth .
 under these circumstances , the unemployment rate does not de- cline from its current level , while core inflation slows only modestly .
 with this configuration of income and interest rates , broad money ag- gregates are projected to expand sluggishly while total nonfinancial debt increases around the pace of nominal gdp .
 over the balance of 1993 , m2 is projected to grow at about a 1 - 1/2 percent pace under alternative b , and , as shown in the table below , to finish the year around the lower bound of its new annual range .
 although special factors that have boosted m2 growth in recent months are seen as fading somewhat , underlying growth in this aggregate is boosted by a little faster growth in nominal income .
 the lure of capital market instruments -- from the still fairly steep yield curve and reported capital gains on securities to date -- is expected to remain strong , and inflows to mutual funds probably will stay near the record pace of the year thus far .
 as a consequence , the velocity of m2 6 . growth rates in the table are based on the assumption that the federal funds rate is held for the remainder of the year at the level established under each of the alternatives .
 is expected to increase at a 3 percent rate in the second half of the year , only a little less than the 4 percent rate of the first half.7 m3 under alternative b is projected to bottom out in august and to edge higher over the remainder of the year .
 although bank credit growth should slow a bit , more of it is expected to be funded by deposits , given the very comfortable capital levels of many banks .
 still , m3 would finish the year a little below its fourth - quarter 1992 base and the lower bound of its range .

 9 - 3/4 9 - 1/4",0," the tightening of policy under alternative c would come much sooner than is now envisioned by market participants .
 as a conse- quence , rates at the short end would increase by the half - point boost in the federal funds rate .
 the prime rate would rise , likely by one - half point , although a quarter - point increase in the federal funds rate might not elicit any change in the prime rate .
 intermediate - term rates , both nominal and real , would move higher , with the extent of the increase depending on whether market participants viewed the action as merely moving forward the current trajectory of expected rate increases or as a fundamentally more aggressive posture that was more certain to achieve price stability .
 perceptions of a firmer stance against inflation would put some downward pressure on more distant forward rates , muting the likely rise in bond yields .
 in any case , the dollar would move higher on foreign exchange markets .
 an outlook for economic growth and inflation stronger than in the staff forecast would bolster the rationale for a policy firming action .
 such an outlook might follow from a view that the more aggressive posture being adopted by banks and other lenders would provide , with lags , considerable stimulus to the economy and prices .
 with the staff 's outlook for spending propensities , m2 would expand at only a 1 percent pace over the final five months of this year under alternative c , ending the year about 3/4 percent above its fourth- quarter 1992 level .
 growth in this aggregate would be restrained not only by larger opportunity costs but also by slower income growth as year - end approached .
 weaker m2 would show through to m3 which would be about flat over the remainder of the year .
 directive language .",0.5,,,0.0
31,1993-09-21,"-- under alternative a , the federal funds rate would decline to 2 - 1/2 percent , either through a reduction in the initial borrowing allowance or a cut in the discount rate by 50 basis points and an unchanged initial borrowing allowance .
 under alternative a , money market interest rates would drop by the full 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate .
 the prime rate would also decrease by this amount .
 intermediate - term rates would fall appreciably , as expectations of the path of short- term rates in the months ahead were revised down , and the dollar would weaken on foreign exchange markets .
 real long - term rates would move lower as well , and the drop in interest and exchange rates would provide additional stimulus to spending over time .
 the extent of the decline in nominal bond rates , however , would depend importantly on how the market interpreted the committee 's rationale for this action .
 this alternative might seem attractive if the committee saw the lack of progress toward full employment in the staff outlook as unsatisfactory and was willing to settle for essentially no further disinflation in this expansion ; market perceptions that the committee had down - weighted its price stability objective could limit declines in nominal long - term rates .
 although the longer - term effects of lower interest rates on money demand may be uncertain , over the next several months deposit rates would lag declines in market rates , boosting money growth under this alternative and providing a little more assurance that the broad monetary aggregates would finish the year within their ranges .
 given the staff spending forecast , m2 would expand at a 2 - 1/2 percent rate over the remainder of the year , ending the year 1 - 1/2 percent above its fourth - quarter 1992 base .
 the boost to growth in income beginning late in the year would tend to lift this aggregate further into its tentative 1994 range early next year .
 some of the more rapid growth in m2 would show through to m3 under alternative a , but expansion of this aggregate would remain quite weak as borrowers continued to direct their credit demands toward long - term markets .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent in combination with an initial allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 250 million .
 in that forecast , short - term rates are assumed to remain at current levels through the end of 1994 .
 growth in output settles into a pace broadly in line with that of potential output , preserving the current modest slack in resource markets .
 accordingly , core inflation edges lower .
 market participants apparently believe that the federal funds rate will remain at 3 percent , at least for the next several months , and under alternative b , money market interest rates would remain around current levels .
 however , participants seem to expect stronger economic growth over coming months than implicit in the staff forecast and little further progress in reducing inflation .
 in the absence of stronger growth , intermediate- and longer - term rates might well drift lower as incoming data tilt market sentiment and investors continue to reach for yield .
 bond yields could remain unusually volatile for a time as market participants continue to assess the 7 .
 demands for seasonal credit are likely to diminish over the intermeeting period , as they typically do in the fall , calling for downward technical adjustment to the borrowing allowance .
 sustainability of the much reduced levels of long - term rates that have recently been reached .
 this skittishness may focus particularly on indicators bearing on the outlook for prices , partly in light of their possible implications for monetary policy going forward .
 consistent with the staff forecast of policy easings in germany and japan , the dollar should trade on the high side of recent levels under alternative b .
 as shown in the table below , m2 under alternative b is projected to grow at a 2 percent average rate over the final four months of this year .

 10 - 3/4 should boost m2 growth a little over this period .
 underlying growth in this aggregate , however , will remain quite sluggish .
 although the flatter yield curve should eventually damp the shift from m2 to capital market assets , we do not expect any slowing in the near term : indeed , with recent capital gains enhancing the advertised returns on mutual funds , inflows could remain quite brisk .
 on a quarterly average basis , growth in m2 would slow to a 1 - 1/2 percent rate in the fourth quarter , implying growth for the year on a q4-to - q4 basis of 1 - 1/4 percent.9 growth in m2 velocity would pick up to a 4 percent rate in the fourth quarter , bringing the increase for the year to 3 percent .
 under alternative b , m3 would grow at a 3/4 percent rate over the remainder of this year , leaving this aggregate just above both its fourth - quarter 1992 level and the bottom of its 8 .
 we expect that nationsbank will transfer its government secur- ity dealer operations , with associated rps , to a nonbank affiliate in october , reversing the transaction it made in july and depressing m2 .
 in part reflecting the surge in refinancing , m1 is projected to ac- celerate to a 12 - 1/4 percent pace over the august - to - december period .
 accompanying this strength in m1 , total reserves are expected to increase at a 16 - 3/4 percent pace over the period and the monetary base at a 10 - 3/4 percent rate .
 the growth of m2 continues to fall short of staff money demand models by substantial margins .
 more conventional models are predict- ing about 5 percent growth this year ; even the expanded models that include the effects of the steep yield curve call for about 3 - 1/2 percent growth in 1993 .

 sluggish demand for bank loans is expected to hold down banks ' needs for funds .

 money market rates would increase by the full 50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate .
 although markets seem still to expect a tightening in policy at some point , action under this alternative would come much sooner than now built into the yield curve .
 intermediate - term rates would increase significantly , especially if the tightening were seen as signalling a more aggressive posture of the federal reserve against inflation and a higher trajectory of short - term rates for a considera- ble period .
 however , lower prospective inflation might decrease far- ahead forward rates , limiting advances in nominal bond yields .",0.5,,,0.0
32,1993-11-16," short - term interest rates , including the prime rate , probably would fall by about the 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate , and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets likely would decline .
 in these circumstances , any lasting reduction in intermediate- and longer - term interest rates likely would be limited by a belief that the action would need to be reversed before too long , as well as by perceptions that the federal reserve was placing less weight 13 .
 the reduction in the federal funds rate would be accomplished either through a commensurate cut in the discount rate or through a reduction in the borrowing allowance to $ 75 million .
 on containing inflationary pressures and more weight on promoting near- term growth in output and employment .
 issuance of bonds and mortgages likely would be heavy , as borrowers reacted to a sense that this was the last window of low long - term rates for quite some time .
 lower short rates might also be seen as desirable if the committee were concerned about the possibility of renewed weakness in economic growth over coming quarters , perhaps brought on by tax increases becoming effective in 1994 .
 this alterna-
 tive would provide somewhat greater assurance that growth of the broad monetary aggregates would be well within their annual ranges in the first half of next year .
 although the steeper yield curve under alternative a would make bond and stock funds more attractive , experience of the last few years suggests some net shift of funds from market instru- ments to m2 in the months following monetary policy easings .
 thus , the staff projects that m2 in march would be 3 - 1/4 percent at an annual rate above its fourth - quarter base , a little above the middle of its tenta- tive range , and m3 would be higher by 2 percent , around the middle of its range .
 directive language",-0.5," three policy alternatives are presented for consideration by the committee .
 under alternative b , the federal funds rate would continue to trade around 3 percent.10
 this alternative is consistent with the monetary policy assumption of a steady federal funds rate for several quarters ahead that underlies the greenbook projection of eco- nomic activity and inflation .
 in that forecast , real gdp growth settles into a 2 - 1/2 percent pace next year , as the stimulus imparted by past interest rate declines and diminishing balance - sheet and credit supply constraints about offsets the drag from continued fiscal retrenchment ; the unemployment rate remains around 6 - 3/4 percent , and core inflation edges down .
 market participants generally seem to believe that the economic expansion will run a little faster than projected by the staff and to avoid a pickup in inflation down the road the federal reserve will begin to firm reserve conditions in the first half of next year .
 if economic and inflation data over coming months instead prove to be closer to the staff forecast , bond yields probably will retrace some of their recent runup .
 as shown in the lower panel of the above table , m2 under alternative b is projected to grow at a 2 - 1/2 percent rate over october to march .
 this would leave m2 in the fourth quarter 1 - 1/4 percent above its q4 1992 base , just within its 1 to 5 percent annual range .
 by next march , this aggregate would be 2 - 3/4 percent at an annual rate above its fourth quarter 1993 base , and well within its provisional range .
 the firming in m2 growth over the next several months reflects forecasts of stronger expansion in nominal gdp late this year , the effects of the recent surge in mortgage refinancing activity , and lagged stimulus from alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m2 m3 m1 alt .

 j the previous flattening of the yield curve .
 despite the latter two effects , m2 velocity rises noticeably further in the fourth and first quarters as funds continue to be diverted from deposits into longer - term mutual funds .
 for that reason , the velocity of m2 + , which adds the market value of net holdings of bond and stock mutual funds to m2 , seems likely to remain more stable than that of m2 in coming quarters .
 ml , which is projected to expand at a 10 - 1/2 percent rate from october to march , would still account for all of the increase in m2 .
 the continued brisk pace of m1 growth mainly owes to earlier declines in its oppor- tunity cost , but sustained strong foreign currency demands also are seen as supporting expansion of this aggregate .
 with core deposits and non - deposit sources continuing to fund the bulk of moderate expansion of bank credit , issuance of managed liabilities in m3 should remain weak .
 m3 would increase at a 1 - 1/2 percent rate from october to march .
 this aggregate would be a little above the lower bound of its 0 to 4 percent range for 1993 and more distinctly within its tentative 1994 range by march .",0," under alternative c , the federal funds rate would rise 1/2 percentage point to 3 - 1/2 percent.12 an immediate firming of reserve market conditions is not embedded in market interest rates , and consequently , short - term interest rates are likely to rise by nearly the full 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds .
 long - term rates probably would rise appreciably at first , but some of those in- creases could be reversed over time as market participants interpreted that action as trimming the trajectory of economic activity and prices and reducing the need for more aggressive tightening in the future .
 in association with continued rapid growth in m1 and required reserves , total reserves would expand at a 9.6 percent pace over the october - march period and the monetary base at a 9.3 percent rate .
 the borrowing allowance would be increased to $ 125 million .
 with dollar - denominated returns rising significantly , the dollar likely would appreciate considerably on foreign exchange markets .
 the committee might favor alternative c if strength in recent economic data were seen as implying that any delay in firming ran an unacceptably high risk that economic activity could develop excessive momentum that would rapidly erode the remaining degree of slack and produce an acceleration of prices .
 even if growth in aggregate demand turns out to be as moderate as in the staff forecast , a tightening would better ensure a resumption of a distinct downward trend to inflation .
 under this alternative , m2 would expand at a 2 percent rate from october through march of next year , leaving growth from the fourth quarter of this year in the lower half of its tentative range .
 m3 would expand at a 1 - 1/4 percent rate from october through march , also in the lower half of its provisional range .",0.5,,,0.0
33,1993-12-21,"-- in the case of alternative a , the federal funds rate would decline to 2 - 1/2 percent and borrowing would fall , perhaps to $ 25 million .
 the easing of policy under alternative a would come as a surprise to market participants , and short - term interest rates would fall by about the 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate .
 intermediate- and
 long - term rates would decline by less ; indeed , the extent of any decline would be quite limited if the easing were seen by market participants to be unsustainable .
 the dollar would weaken on foreign exchange markets .
 under alternative a , m2 would expand at a 2 - 1/4 percent pace , close to that evident since midyear , buoyed partly by less of a slowdown in m1 than under alternatives b and c
 , m3 would grow at a 1 - 1/4 percent pace from november to march .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window of $ 50 million .
 in that forecast , short - term rates are maintained at around current levels through most of 1994 .
 the spurt in output in the current quarter , related importantly to production adjustments in the automobile industry , is not sustained .
 output decelerates in the first quarter , and then settles into a growth pace broadly in line with that of potential over the balance of the year , held down to an extent by scheduled fiscal retrenchment .
 with economic slack persisting , albeit at around the current diminished level , prices decelerate modestly further .
 relative to the staff forecast , market participants appear to be anticipating a bit more strength in aggregate demand through next year , and have built into interest rates substantial odds that policy will begin to tighten in the first part of the year to keep inflation from increasing .
 nonetheless , market interest rates are unlikely to move down much on balance under the steady funds rate of alternative b in coming months , since the market would continue to expect a tightening before long .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar under alternative b should stay around current levels .
 c growth from november to march m2 2 - 1/4

 -1/2 2 1 - 3/4 m3 1 - 1/2 1 - 1/4 1 m1 7 6 - 1/2
 growth of the broad monetary aggregates , shown in the table above , is expected to slow a little through march under alternative b from the faster pace of recent months , but to stay above the pace of 1993 as a whole .
 this moderation is entirely accounted for by identifiable special factors .
 in particular , the recent falloff in mortgage refinancing applications portends a marked reduction in demand deposits associated with this activity .
 this effect subtracts around 3 percentage points from the expansion of m1 and 1 percentage point from m2 over the november - to - march period .
 ( increases in refinancing over the summer and early fall added an estimated 1 - 3/4 and 1/2 percentage points of growth to m1 and m2 from august to november . )
 abstracting from this factor , growth of m2 is projected to pick up a little in coming months .
 shifts from m2 should continue to moderate a little as balance sheets become better aligned with the current structure of interest rates .
 we expect flows into long - term mutual funds to average below the record pace of most of 1993 , react- ing also to heightened investor perceptions of risk after the backup in yields and associated capital losses of october and november .

 nonetheless , substantial portfolio shifts are expected to persist , as the yield curve remains relatively steep , and these shifts will continue to damp the growth of m2 relative to nominal income .
 the velocity of m2 in the first quarter would rise at a 4 percent rate , down only a bit from the 4 - 1/2 percent rate projected for the current quarter .
 m2 by march would have expanded at a 2 per- cent annual rate from its fourth - quarter 1993 base under alternative b , placing this aggregate well above the lower end of its provisional 1 to 5 percent growth range for next year .
 however , monthly money growth in the first quarter could be especially volatile and difficult to interpret .
 seasonal factors were distorted by policy - induced surges in money in early 1991 and 1992 .
 in addition , amounts and patterns of tax payments , and associated adjustments in money hold- ings , could be atypical , given the uncertain effects of the new tax law .
 under alternative b , m3 would advance at a 1 percent annual rate over the november - to - march period ; by march this aggregate would be 1 - 1/4 percent above its fourth - quarter 1993 base , well within its 0 to 4 percent provisional range for 1994 .
 bank credit should continue to expand around the 5 percent pace of 1993 , and banks are expected to persist in funding much of the growth with lower cost , non - m3 sources , in part to avoid deposit insurance premiums .
 the debt of the nonfederal sectors will grow at a 4 - 3/4 percent rate through march , in line with the stepped - up pace of the second half of 1993 .
 household borrowing is expected to continue to be strong , reflecting more comfortable financial positions and the high level of spending on housing and durable goods .
 overall financing needs of businesses are expected to grow as advances in capital spending outstrip growth in internal funds , and as net equity issuance is held down by a major merger .
 total debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to increase at a 5 - 3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter of 1993 to march , well above the lower end of its provisional 4 to 8 percent range for next year .",0,"-- under alternative c , the federal funds rate would move up to 3 - 1/2 percent and the borrow- ing allowance to $ 75 million .
 the rise in the federal funds rate under alternative c , to 3 - 1/2 percent , would come sooner than now anticipated by market participants and built into markets interest rates .
 rates at the near end of the maturity spectrum would rise by almost the full 50 basis point increase in the funds rate ; intermediate- and long - term rates would go up , but as usual by less .
 the extraordinary spread of the prime rate over funding costs and the more aggressive lending posture of commercial banks suggest that the prime rate might notch up only 1/4 percentage point .
 the eventual increase in long - term rates could be limited because such a tightening at this time might be seen as better ensuring continuing moderate expansion and disinflation in the years ahead .
 quality spreads would be expected to remain fairly nar- row as a firming in the policy stance in the context of market expec- tations of a more solid economic expansion would not be likely to raise many concerns about credit quality .
 higher yields on dollar assets would put upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar .
 m2 would grow at a 1 - 3/4 percent annual rate over the november - to- march period , restrained by higher opportunity costs .
 m3 would expand under alternative c at only a 3/4 percent pace over the november - to- march period .
 such concerns could arise from a view that current - quarter strength in economic activity suggested that the economy was on an appreciably higher growth track , perhaps because financial factors damping expansion have faded , allowing the current accommodative stance of monetary policy to show through more fully into aggregate demand .
 in that event , the output gap would be closing more quickly than in the staff forecast , raising the risks of an overshooting of activity relative to its potential and hence greater inflationary pressures over time .
 a timely firming in policy now could obviate a more aggressive tightening later to keep inflation from picking up , involving perhaps even higher real interest rates if delays permitted inflation expectations to deteriorate .",0.5,,,0.0
34,1994-03-22,,N,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 3 - 1/4 percent in association with ad- justment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 75 million .
 with market participants expecting appreciable increases in the federal funds rate in coming months , including 25 basis points at the march fomc meeting , interest rates could tend to drift lower under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b . rate de-
 clines would be quite small initially if market participants still believed that the next tightening step was imminent but had merely been delayed , perhaps by the unsettled market conditions of late .
 as the intermeeting period unfolds , economic data in line with the green- book projection should suggest moderate economic growth and no inten- sification of inflation pressures , and interest rates could fall noticeably under this alternative as markets reassessed the trajectory of federal reserve tightening .
 the scope for any rate decreases , especially at the long end of the market , could be quite limited , however , if the hiatus in tightening were to call into question the federal reserve 's anti - inflationary resolve .
 later in the intermeeting period the borrowing allowance may need to be raised to reflect normal increases in the demand for seasonal credit . head off additional inflationary pressures .
 the staff economic fore- cast assumes that policy needs to tighten eventually to maintain high enough real rates to avoid an overheating of the economy .
 however , that forecast does not necessarily assume a move as soon as the march meeting .
 even if long - term rates were expected to decline appreci- ably , alternative b might be selected were the economy nevertheless seen as remaining below
 its long - term potential and inflation pres- sures contained .
 such an assessment could be based on a sense that recent data suggested less momentum in the economy or on a judgment that the behavior of costs and broad price indexes has been indicating a greater degree of slack in the economy than embodied in the staff forecast .
-- ( 16 ) growth in m2 would average 2 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate over the february - to - june period under alternative b , up from only 3/4 percent over january and february , even as growth in nominal income continues to slow .
-- nonetheless , m2 velocity would con- tinue to rise in the second quarter under alternative b , but its 2 - 3/4 percent annual pace of expansion would be well below that of the two previous quarters .",0,"-- under alternative c , the federal funds rate would increase 50 basis points , to 3 - 3/4 percent through an increase in the initial borrowing allowance to $ 100 million .
 in addition to possibly contributing to more settled market conditions , alternative c might be preferred if the committee saw significant risks of greater inflation going forward .
 to fore- stall this possibility , the committee may wish to take prompter action than assumed in the staff forecast .
 the 50 basis point increase in the funds rate under this alternative would tend to sustain the backup in real intermediate- and long - term rates , which may be seen as needed to restrain inflation pressures , especially in the context of a con- siderably more accommodative lending posture of intermediaries .
 instead of tightening to the degree contained in alternative c , the committee could firm reserve conditions by enough to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points .
 such an action would validate market expectations for the outcome of the meeting , and the effect on most interest rates would be small .
 this alternative might be favored if the committee were not certain that the strength of demands in the economy and credit markets required a 1/2 percentage point hike in the funds rate at this time .
 however , such a smaller action could leave market participants with a sense that another tightening might be forthcoming fairly soon , perhaps contributing to continued market skittishness .",0.5,,,0.25
35,1994-05-17,,N,,0," the case for increasing the intended federal funds rate only 25 basis points as under alternative c would seem to hinge on the judgment that financial market participants have exaggerated the like- ly strength of future spending relative to the economy 's potential and hence of prospective inflation pressures .
 in this view , taking the fundamentals reasonably into account , the markets have gotten "" ahead of the curve "" and the risk of disappointing them should not be allowed to divert the federal reserve from a gradual course of 25-basis - point adjustments in the stance of policy toward neutrality .
 with the loca- tion of a neutral funds rate itself a moving target -- and lower to the extent that real long - term interest rates are higher -- such an approach would allow more time to assess the needed federal funds rate in- creases as new information on the economy and prices becomes avail- able .
 short - term rates likely would edge off immediately after a modest policy tightening .
 the initial reaction in capital and foreign exchange markets could be adverse if the small size of the move were seen as signalling a reluctance to move aggressively to head off an inflationary buildup .
 however , the odds on such a reaction may have been reduced by the recent favorable price data .
 in this context , market participants might be more inclined to interpret the smaller move as sufficient to counter coming inflation pressures and to project a lower trajectory of short - term rates , which would pass through to lower longer - term rates .",0.25,"-- under alternative d , the federal funds rate would be raised to 4 - 1/4 per- cent , either by increasing the initial borrowing allowance to $ 225 million or by raising the discount rate to 3 - 1/2 percent , while keep- ing the initial allowance for discount window borrowing at $ 175 mil- lion .
 compared with the staff 's assessment , financial market participants now appear to be anticipating appreciably more federal reserve tightening by the fall , judging by the rate of 5 - 1/4 percent on federal funds futures for october .
 many in the market expect the committee to increase the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting , though others anticipate only a 25 basis point increase , and the federal funds futures quote is in between .
 very short - term rates might thus increase slightly under alternative d .
 the behavior of rates on instruments of a few months ' maturity or longer would depend importantly on whether the market interpreted the larger increase of alternative d as indicating a steeper trajectory of future policy actions , and perhaps the need for greater cumulative tightening .
 if expectations were to ratchet up in this manner , as appeared to have been the case in some of the tightenings earlier this year , there could be sizable hikes along the maturity spectrum .
 however , several factors suggest that the market may react more favorably this time .
 for one , such a move -- larger than recent ones -- might assuage concerns that the federal reserve was "" falling behind the curve .
 "" a rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar , which would be expected under this alternative , would also help to reduce inflation concerns .
 moreover , an action of this magnitude coupled with a discount rate increase , depending perhaps on the wording of the associated announce- ment , might be seen as suggesting that the federal reserve thought it had reached the neighborhood of "" neutrality .
 if the action is seen this way , policy would be expected to be kept on hold for a while , or at least to tighten more slowly and be more dependent on incoming data .
 with one source of uncertainty diminished , at least for a time , investors who had been avoiding longer - term instruments pending the federal reserve 's action might be tempted to extend maturities .
 bond yields could still back up somewhat in the aftermath of an announce- ment of the federal reserve 's choice of alternative d , but these other influences should limit any increase and work to reduce yields over time .
 provided incoming data on the economy indicate a moderate path for activity , in line with the staff forecast .

36,1994-08-16,,N," such a view might follow from placing more weight on recent 8 .
 later in the intermeeting period it may prove necessary to reduce the borrowing allowance a little to reflect the onset of the typical unwinding of the summer bulge in seasonal borrowing .
 soft spending indicators , on undesired inventory buildups , or on the effects of previous policy tightenings . waiting for more clarifica- tion of how much slowing in spending growth is already in train would be seen as posing fewer risks than implied in the staff forecast if it were thought that favorable readings on price indexes suggested that some slack remained in the economy .
 market participants now seem to expect at least a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate at the august meeting , with some possibility of a 50 basis point increase ; a 4 - 3/4 percent funds rate is anticipated by late september .
 in these circumstances , the choice of no change in the stance of policy under alternative b would result in some decline in short - term interest rates , and the dollar might tend to weaken on foreign exchange markets .
 long - term rates could move lower , at least initially .
 market participants might view the absence of action as indicating a milder degree of tightening into the future as well -- perhaps because the federal reserve saw less inflation in the outlook than previously thought .
 however , rate de-
 clines would be limited to the extent that market participants ques- tioned the fed 's anti - inflation resolve ; absent subsequent data point- ing to further weakening in aggregate demand or surprisingly modest price pressures , concerns about inflation would mount , pushing up longer - term interest rates .
-- the path for alternative b is based on the assumption of no change in the federal funds rate for the rest of this year .
-- moreover , with short - term rates unchanged under alternative b , insti- tution - only money funds should be stable after large runoffs through the spring .",0," an increase of this size , by itself , would be unlikely to have a substan- tial effect on spending or prices , but a small tightening could lend assurance that policy had firmed enough to keep the economy around its potential .
 although further tightening could prove to be necessary , the committee might judge that the case for a larger move is not yet estab- lished .
 as noted above , alternative c is about what is built into the structure of market interest rates , and neither interest nor exchange rates are likely to react very strongly to such an action .
 however , this would be the first move since the announcement in may that excess accommodation had been substantially removed and could be seen as mark- ing a return to the usual practice of reacting to incoming data with small changes in reserve conditions .
 markets could become somewhat more unsettled and volatile , especially if the rise in short - term rates were perceived as less than needed and therefore likely to be followed by another increase but of uncertain timing .",0.25,"-- ( 12 ) the more forceful move of alternative d might be chosen if the committee viewed the economic situation as highly likely to require substantial additional monetary tightening , for example , of the scope embodied in the steep tilt to the yield curve over the next few years .

 inaction might be deemed particularly appropriate if the committee believed that strains on capacity could be less pressing than in the staff forecast , either because potential output might be greater than assumed by the staff or because more restraint on spending could be in the pipeline in view of the substantial increases in interest rates over the past year .
 more- over , slow growth of a broad array of monetary and credit aggregates might be seen as suggesting that financial conditions are not con- ducive to a pickup in underlying inflation .
 a pause would allow the committee to accumulate more evidence on these questions . such a wait - and - see posture would accord with the tone of the press statement announcing the policy action taken at the august meeting .
 market opinions on what the committee might do at this meeting are split .
 some analysts have interpreted the recent economic news as implying sufficiently greater inflation potential to overcome any presumption of a policy pause ; they expect a firming action , per- haps of 50 basis points .
 others still anticipate a hiatus in the process of policy tightening ; however , even many of those in the latter camp seem to expect some action no later than the november meeting .
 while few actually foresee a 25 basis point increase , the composite effect of these different views has produced a federal funds futures rate for october that is 25 basis points above the current funds rate .
 nonetheless , maintenance of existing reserve conditions under alternative b might elicit little reaction in rates beyond the very shortest maturities because market participants would assume that tightening had simply been postponed .
 in these circumstances , longer- term instruments might trade in their current ranges at least for a time , although security prices probably will remain quite sensitive to news bearing on inflation pressures as market participants attempt to gauge the extent of future policy restraint .
 in that regard , under the staff forecast , economic releases over the next few months would suggest that inflation is on a slightly higher track and that final demand remains fairly vigorous .
 absent unanticipated changes in policy abroad , the foreign exchange value of the dollar most likely would remain around its current level , though it could come under some downward pressure if inflation expectations began to deteriorate further .
-- for illustrative purposes , the path under alternative b was derived assuming that the funds rate would hold at its current level for the remainder of the year .
 over the september - to - december period , m2 would expand at a 1 - 1/2 percent rate under alternative b .
 the staff has assumed that deposit rates will continue to adjust sluggishly to market rates .

 waiting in these circumstances might risk the development of a degree of infla- tion momentum -- partly through expectations channels -- that could make it more difficult to contain inflation at recent rates , much less achieve the long - run goal of price stability .
 the 50 basis point firming of alternative d is the most likely of the three policy options to keep the federal reserve "" ahead of the curve "" of inflation pressures and consequently to limit the extent to which policy might later need to tighten .
 if the committee were uncertain about how much tightening would be required but wanted to respond to recent data , the more modest 25 basis point move of alternative

-- a considerable portion of the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate under alternative d would pass through to other short - term rates .
-- the path for the aggregates under alternative d assumes that the funds rate moves up to 5 - 1/4 percent at this meeting and stays there for the balance of the year .",0.5,0.0
38,1994-11-15,,N," choice of the unchanged policy of alternative b might be based on the judgments that most of the effects of previous increases in interest rates are still in the pipeline , that convincing signs of higher inflation have not yet appeared , and that under these circum- stances the committee can await evidence indicating whether the effects of previous monetary tightening will be sufficient to restrain spending adequately .
 the weakness in the monetary aggregates and moderate expansion of overall measures of credit may be seen as offering support for the view that financial conditions are not con- ducive to a sustained pickup in inflation .
 indeed , even without another tightening move , m2 seems likely to come in just below the 1 percent lower bound of its annual growth range this year and m1 to come in at only 2 percent .
-- under alternative b , offering rates through the first quarter would continue to adjust upward in the face of steady money market rates .
-- both m2 and m3 would record slower growth over the next five months than under alternative b .",0,"-- a still larger increase in the federal funds rate than envisioned under alternative c is also discussed .
 the 50 basis point rise in the funds rate under alternative c could be favored on the grounds that the incoming data on economic activity again have been stronger than expected .
 with the economy perhaps overshooting its potential rather than settling into a "" soft landing , "" the risks of an associated future pickup in inflation pressures would seem to have increased .
 a 1/2 point move in the federal funds rate , perhaps accompanied by an equal increment to the discount rate , could be seen as keeping pace with the need for policy firming in a deliberate manner consistent with the size and frequency of recent policy actions .
 the resulting real federal funds rate would be a bit above its long - run average , but restraint of at least this magnitude might be appropriate in light of the current pressure on capacity and the stimulative effects of the drop in the dollar and the easing of terms and standards of bank lending .
 with market participants generally appearing to have built in a move of at least this size , interest rates could exhibit little initial reaction to the implementation of alternative c . the receipt of information on output and price developments over the intermeeting period along the lines of the relatively robust greenbook forecast might reinforce the market 's perception that additional system tightening is required , and interest rates could edge higher later in the period .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar could remain around recent trading levels if nominal interest rates move sufficiently higher to offset the effects of a heightened sense of potential inflationary pressures .
-- ( 16 )  under the 50 basis point increase in the funds rate of alternative c ,",0.5,,,0.75
39,1994-12-20,,N," two policy alternatives are presented below for con- sideration by the committee .
 the associated level of adjust- ment plus seasonal borrowing would initially be $ 125 million , but borrowing would subsequently drift lower in keeping with the typical winding down of demands for seasonal credit .
 alternative
 c entails a 50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate , to 6 percent , achieved either through an equivalent increase in the discount rate with the same path for the borrowing allowance or an increase in the initial borrowing allowance to $ 175 million , with the same seasonal reductions thereafter .
 keeping the stance of policy unchanged , as under alternative b , might appear warranted in light of the size of the recent action and of current financial conditions .
 real short- and long - term interest rates now look to be somewhat above longer - term averages , the dollar has moved higher , and all money measures have remained slug- gish . if the committee thought these developments implied a reason- able probability that policy actions to date had put in place suffi- cient restraint to contain inflation , it might want to await addi- tional information in gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any future action .
 moreover , the committee might have gained some leeway to pause in its tightening , despite persistent strength in production and spending indicators , because the larger move in november , together with favorable wage and price data , has helped to calm developing inflation fears .
 furthermore , after the news on orange county and on derivatives - related difficulties at some bank holding companies , mar- ket participants seem to be especially wary of additional announce- ments of large losses on leveraged or derivatives positions .
 through year - end , lenders are likely to be particularly conscious of possible credit quality problems of the counterparties that show up on their published statements .
 while a policy tightening on december 20 is unlikely to trigger market dislocations , such a possibility can not be ruled out ; in any case , the chances of such problems will be even more remote after year - end .
 as noted above , market participants now assess the probability of a near - term tightening as fairly low , but they see an intermeeting move before the next scheduled fomc meeting on january 31 and february 1 as more likely .
 in these circumstances , and given the seemingly greater confidence of late in financial markets that the system will act as appropriate to counter a buildup in inflationary pressures , interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to change very much in the immediate aftermath of a deci- sion to leave policy unchanged , as under alternative b . movements in financial markets subsequently will depend , of course , on the nature of incoming data .
 continued strength in employment or final demand , especially if accompanied by adverse wage and price developments , would firm market expectations of system action early next year .
 inaction in the face of such data could risk the re - emergence of con- cerns that the federal reserve was falling behind in its efforts to contain inflation , raising long - term interest rates and weakening the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 under alternative b , m2 would strengthen to a 1 - 1/4 percent rate over the november - to - march period .
 opportunity costs of holding m2 - -especially the small time deposit and money market mutual funds components -- should narrow from current high levels as retail deposit and money fund rates continue to adjust upward to recent in- creases in market rates .
 as a result , growth in m2 velocity would slow to a 5 percent rate in the first quarter of next year from a 7 percent rate in the current quarter .
 m1 would continue to edge down- ward in response to previous increases in opportunity costs , although the drag from the slowdown of mortgage refinancing activity will be diminishing as such activity stabilizes at relatively low levels.7 boosted in part by faster growth in m2 , m3 would be expected to grow at a 2 - 1/4 percent rate over the november - to - march period .
 in addition , a pickup in m3-type money market mutual funds , as rates on such funds catch up with market rates , would act to lift m3 growth .
 with the deposit components of m1 contracting over the november - to - march period , total reserves would fall at a 5 percent annual rate .
 in contrast , the monetary base would rise at a 6 percent pace , supported by the growth of currency .

 the resulting 6 percent federal funds rate would imply a real federal funds rate that falls more assuredly in a zone that could be characterized as moderately restrictive .
 following so soon after the november move , a policy tightening at this meeting would consolidate , or even extend , the gains made in reducing infla- tion expectations in financial markets .
 the inclination to adopt alternative c would be bolstered by a belief that financial markets have largely absorbed the orange county shock and the risks of further disruptions are de minimus .
 under alternative c , money market interest rates would firm somewhat , especially those at the shortest end , as the tightening would come somewhat sooner than now expected .
 to the degree that market participants saw such an action as evidence of an even stronger anti - inflationary resolve of the committee , nominal forward rates at intermediate- and longer - term maturities would tend to decline , limit- ing any increase in longer - term rates .
 real interest rates , however , would rise , bolstering the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 quality spreads could widen a bit as higher rates increased debt - ser- vicing burdens and raised questions about the ongoing strength of the expansion .
 projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from november to march are shown below under both alternatives .
 ( more detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following pages . )
 the staff expects the growth of the monetary aggregates to remain damped over coming months , restrained by prior ( and under alternative c , current ) increases in opportunity costs .
 nonetheless , growth rates for the aggregates generally are a little faster than envisioned in november .
 expansion in nominal income is now seen as stronger over the late months of 1994 and early months of 1995 .
 in addition , the broader aggregates are likely to be buoyed slightly by shifts from longer - term mutual funds in the wake of less attractive returns and unfavorable publicity ; however , with deposit rates still well short of market rates , most of the savings diverted from mutual funds is likely to continue to go into direct purchases of securities .

40,1995-03-28," the easing in reserve market conditions under alternative a could be justified if the unexpected weakness in the recent economic data were read as indicating that previous policy tightenings risked an unacceptably sharp slowdown in spending later this year-- especially since a real federal funds rate remaining above its longer- term average might add to the restraint on demand already in the pipe- line .
 concerns in this regard might be accentuated by the further deterioration in the mexican situation and repercussions on u.s .
 net exports .
 in this view , with pressures on resources possibly abating appreciably , the risks of worsening inflation would seem minimal .
 in effect , choice of alternative a would imply a view that not only have longer - term interest and exchange rates not overshot on the downside , but that policy may still be too tight to allow markets to compensate fully for oncoming economic weakness .
 the 50 basis point easing of the federal funds rate under alternative a also would surprise market participants .
 both long- and short - term rates are likely to fall substantially as a result , as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 although the federal reserve 's anti - inflationary credibility has apparently increased over the last few months , it could begin to erode if incom- ing data were to indicate that inflation pressures were not abating , prompting the market to judge that the easing had been unwarranted .
 under those circumstances , long - term rates would begin to retrace their initial declines , particularly if the dollar came under persist- ent , intense downward pressure .
-- the growth of the broader aggregates be expected to breach the upper or lower bands of their annual ranges , although m3 is virtually at the upper end of its range under alternative a . (",-0.5," a key element in assessing the appropriate stance of policy going forward is the interpretation of the causes and conse- quences of the sizeable movements in prices on securities and foreign exchange markets over recent months .
 as discussed in paragraph 2 , the drop in dollar interest and exchange rates seemed primarily a response to the perceived softening in aggregate demand .
 the question is whether the market reaction has been appropriate to the new informa- tion in the sense of leaving rates at levels consistent with the com- mittee 's objectives for the economy and prices .
 with an unchanged federal funds rate in the staff forecast , interest and exchange rates close to recent levels are associated with activity growing slowly enough to move the economy back to the neighborhood of its potential and core cpi inflation flattening out at a somewhat higher rate than in 1994 .
 if the committee believes such an outcome were both likely and acceptable , then it may be inclined to leave the current level of the federal funds rate in place , as under alternative b , unless and 6 . over the upcoming intermeeting period , the borrowing allowance likely will have to be raised to reflect the normal upturn in seasonal credit in the spring of the year . until incoming economic data or a clarification of prospective fiscal policy begin to point to a different outlook .
 the softer cast to recent economic data along with statements by federal reserve officials have led market participants to the virtually unanimous opinion that the fomc will keep its policy stance on hold at this committee meeting .
 consequently , there would likely be little change in interest rates in response to the choice of alternative b .
 while sentiment in foreign exchange markets has proven difficult to predict , no clear rationale presents itself for signifi- ca nt further dollar depreciation over the intermeeting period .
-- the alternative b growth from march to september m2 2 - 1/2",0," a case for the 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c could be made on the grounds that , with economic activity having already overshot its potential and the persistence of the slowdown in economic growth not yet firmly estab- lished , more insurance should be taken out against a serious deterior- ation in inflation trends .
 the risk of such an outcome would seem even greater if it were judged that markets have overreacted , implying undesirable additional stimulus from the declines in interest and exchange rates and the rise in stock prices .
 the need for prompt further policy firming would be especially pressing to the extent that the committee were dissatisfied with the prospects in the staff fore- cast for a sustained higher level of core inflation .
 judging from the alternative simulations in the greenbook , even a 50 basis point
 crease in the federal funds rate would leave the core cpi inflation rate in 1996 above that in 1994 and might not be sufficient to restore a downward tilt in subsequent years .
 with financial markets having built in no near - term monetary policy tightening , choice of alternative c would come as a surprise .
 market participants might alter their perceptions of the federal reserve 's longer - term intentions and likely reactions to future economic data .
 the resulting higher expected path of short- term interest rates over the intermediate term would act to raise bond rates , especially in real terms .
 but for nominal yields , the more favorable inflation prospects for the out years , and the associated reduction in expected short - term interest rates for those years , would serve as a partial offset .
 the unexpected rise in u.s .
 real interest rates across the term structure , other things equal , would provide support for the dollar on foreign exchange markets .",0.5,,,0.0
41,1995-05-23," the committee might consider the easing of monetary policy under alternative a appropriate if it saw substantial risks that the recent sluggish growth of final demand and the associated inventory correction could develop into a prolonged period of growth below potential .
 in this view , the declines this year in the dollar and market interest rates might not be adequate in themselves to sus- tain the expansion , given underlying trends in aggregate demand .
 real rates could be seen as still too high ; for example , the 6 percent funds rate implies short - term real rates above longer - term averages , assuming inflation settles down at 3 percent as in the staff forecast .
 committee members might have particular concerns about the level of real rates if they perceived strong odds of a significantly tighter stance of fiscal policy than is incorporated in the staff forecast .
 such a policy shift would lower "" equilibrium "" real interest rates by directly reducing government spending and , perhaps , by increasing private saving propensities .
 markets do not currently appear to have built in a trajectory to a balanced budget and would probably respond to credible measures to reach this target by bidding down longer - term yields .
 these declines would , by themselves , help to bolster activity in the near term .
 to cushion the fiscal restraint adequately , how- ever , declines in long - term rates might need to be reinforced through an easing in monetary policy .
 short - term market rates under alternative a would like- ly drop close to one - half percentage point .
 long - term markets could rally further and lower rates would persist , at least until economic data pointed to a vigorous bounceback in economic activity .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline .",-0.5,"-- under alternative b , federal funds would continue to trade around 6 percent .
-- if the committee sees the staff forecast as the likely and desired outcome and the risks around it to be reasonably well - balanced , then selection of unchanged reserve market conditions , as under alternative b , would be favored .
-- 7 . to accommodate rising demands for seasonal credit , the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowings would be raised initially to $ 225 million under alternative b . further increases would likely be necessary during the intermeeting period under all of the alternatives .
 market participants generally anticipate no change in the stance of monetary policy at this meeting .
 thus , market rates would not be expected to react to selection of alternative b by the committee .
 however , the recent shifts in the yield curve seem to embody expectations of continued underlying softness in aggregate demand sufficient to induce the federal reserve to ease policy later in the year .
 under the staff forecast , incoming information on spend- ing would suggest a bit more vigor in the economy than would be con- sistent with the market 's outlook , and interest rates may tend to edge higher on balance over the intermeeting period .
 market conditions could remain volatile .
 expectations about the economic and policy outlook may be especially prone to revision , given the size and recency of the shift in sentiment .
 in addition , financial asset prices may be sensitive to progress through the congress of the various fiscal policy initiatives currently under discussion .
-- ( 14 ) growth of the monetary and credit aggregates under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alternative b is presented in the table below .
 m2 growth , by contrast , is projected to edge up slight- ly from that of the previous four months , to a 2 - 1/2 percent pace over april through september ; this aggregate would remain in the lower half of its l - to-5 percent annual range under alternative b . although slower growth of nominal income over the second and third quarters will damp the demand for money , opportunity costs of holding m2 assets have leveled off and begun to fall ; as the depressing effects of earlier increases in opportunity costs diminish , m2 should grow more closely in line with income .
 m2 velocity is projected to continue 8 .
 the effect of the reduction in loan growth on bank credit is expected to be buffered by slower runoffs of securities from bank portfolios .
 9 . despite reduced opportunity costs , m1 is projected to contract at a 3/4 percent annual rate over the april - to - september period , reflecting a reversal of the tax - related buildup in april and the ( the sweeps are estimated to be lowering m1 growth by a little over 3 percentage points in may ; because funds are swept into mmdas , m2 is not affected . )
 the m1 projection assumes that no further sweep programs will be instituted .
 with required reserves contracting in association with the decline in m1 deposits , total reserves are ( footnote continues on next page ) to rise over the second and third quarters , but at only a 1 - 1/2 per- cent average annual rate -- far more slowly than the 5 percent increase over the previous four quarters .
 the projected growth rate of m2 averages just a bit below predictions of the standard staff model over the second and third quarters -- consistent with the recent small pre- diction errors of the model and the staff 's judgment that deposit rates will run below what historical patterns would suggest .
 flows into stock and bond mutual funds are expected to continue at around the modest pace experienced over the first four months of the year , and m2 + is forecast to expand at about a 4 percent rate over the april - september period , bringing its growth from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 3 - 1/2 percent .
 ( footnote continued from previous page ) projected to fall somewhat over the april - to - september period ; the monetary base is nevertheless expected to expand at about a 7 - 1/4 percent annual rate , supported by continued strong net shipments of currency abroad .
 directive language",0,"-- under alternative c , the federal funds rate would be boosted 1/2 percentage point , to 6 - 1/2 percent .
 the fifty - basis - point firming of alternative c might be favored by the committee if it wished to provide more assurance that pressures on resources would soon diminish , so as not to perpetuate the recently elevated rate of inflation and , over time , to return the economy toward a disinflationary path .
 the depreciation of the dol- lar , the rise in bond and equity prices , and the continued relaxation of terms and conditions on bank loans this year
 have in effect eased financial conditions substantially .
 markets seem to have reacted strongly to what could prove to be only a moderate downshift in underlying demand conditions , and current financial conditions may therefore provide excessive stimulus to an economy already operating around its potential .
 with markets apparently having concluded that rates are unlikely to rise significantly further , the response in the financial markets to the 50 basis point increase of alternative c could be sub- stantial .
 short - term rates , including the prime rate , would likely rise by the full amount of the increase in the federal funds rate , and intermediate - term rates would climb considerably as well .
 the boost to nominal yields on long - term treasuries would be limited by any reductions in premiums for expected inflation , but yield spreads on private paper -- including bank funding instruments -- could widen if market participants saw a significantly greater risk of a downturn in business activity or if higher interest rates were seen as impairing profit margins .
 bond market volatility could be appreciable as market participants attempted to sort out the implications of unanticipated tightening for inflation , the strength of the expansion , and credit risks .
 the dollar probably would strengthen noticeably , extending the firming evident over the past week or so .",0.5,,,0.0
42,1995-08-22," a further easing of policy , as under alternative a , could be supported if recent price and wage news were read as suggest- ing that the underlying determinants of inflation were more favorable than in the staff forecast .
 with inflation and inflation expectations decreasing in these circumstances , nominal rates would have to be reduced to keep real rates from rising .
 indeed , the committee might want to lower real rates as well if it wished to realize a little higher output as well as lower inflation .
 in addition , the committee might want to consider lowering the federal funds rate if it were concerned that risks to the economic outlook were still seen to be concentrated on the down side .
 such risks might be viewed as height- ened by the recent increases in longer - term interest rates and in the foreign exchange value of the dollar , if the committee thought that markets had overreacted to stronger data , especially in light of on- coming fiscal restraint .
 the drop in the federal funds rate of 1/2 percentage point contemplated under alternative a would be much larger and sooner than market participants currently expect .
 as a consequence , short- term interest rates would fall nearly 50 basis points and banks prob- ably would cut the prime rate 1/2 percentage point .
 the immediate effect of an easing likely would be to reduce intermediate- and long- term rates as well , especially if the federal reserve 's perceived optimism on inflation were to influence the market 's assessment of the outlook . unless incoming data confirmed an improved inflation pic- ture , however , market participants would come to question the sus- tainability of the drop in short - term rates , and intermediate- and long - term rates could back up .
 in any case , the dollar likely would fall as system action reduced real interest rates .
 growth rates of the broad monetary aggregates are ex- pected to continue to slow from their recent very rapid pace , but to remain relatively strong .
 portfolio shifts into m2 assets should abate with the stability of short - term rates and now - higher long - term rates , which make bond funds more attractive .
 the velocity of m2 is expected to decline in the third quarter , but primarily because of the bulge in m2 growth already experienced .
 in the fourth quarter , velocity is projected to be flat .
 for the year , m2 is expected to remain below the 5 percent upper bound of its annual range , even under alternative a .4
 the projected softening in m3 owes primarily to lower growth in institutional money funds as their yields become better aligned with market rates .
 bank credit is expected to expand at a moderate pace , and issuance of managed liabilities in m3 should remain strong , perhaps encouraged to a small degree by the recent decline in deposit insurance premiums .
 m3 appears likely to break the upper bound of its new range under any of the alternative policy 4 .
 m1 is expected to continue to decline as more banks introduce arrangements to sweep funds from now accounts to mmdas to reduce re- serve requirements . assuming only a moderate amount of about $ 1 bil- lion of additional sweeps over each of the last four months of the year , this financial innovation will reduce m1 growth over the four quarters of 1995 by 1 - 3/4 percentage points .
 such programs , of course , leave m2 unaffected .

 thus , the choice of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b should have little immediate impact on market interest rates .
 over the intermeeting period , data in line with the staff 's forecast of a pickup in output growth to a moderate pace might remove any lingering expectations of policy ease among market participants ; but with inflation also projected to be quite subdued , substantial shifts in the anticipated course of policy are unlikely .
 at the cur- rent ceiling for federal government debt , the staff does not expect the treasury to alter financing patterns much until late september or to run out of cash until the first half of november .
 nonetheless , as the room under the debt ceiling shrinks , absent signs of some narrow- ing of the differences between the president and congressional leaders , financial markets may begin to focus more on the implications for debt markets and the economy of a disruption in federal financing .
 or possibly even a temporary default .
 to date , interest rates appear to have been unaffected by the possibility of such a disruption , and over the intermeeting period , which ends before the new fiscal year , markets will probably remain of the view that in the end some com- promise will be reached to avert the most dire consequences .
 the stronger economic data available over the recent intermeeting period could be read as suggesting that policy in the latter part of 1994 and first part of 1995 might not have been as restraining as suggested by the level of short - term real rates relative to their long - run averages .
 nominal values of the foreign exchange value of the dollar and of bond yields are still appreciably below their levels of last fall , even though the nominal federal funds has been raised 1 percentage point on balance since that time .
 with inflation relatively subdued , it seems highly likely that real exchange rates and long - term interest rates have fallen notice- ably as well over the last nine months .
 these declines , together with generally supportive credit conditions , could be viewed as underpin- ning the continued momentum in business and household spending .
 in any event , an unchanged stance of policy would buy time for more in- formation to accumulate to determine whether the economy is indeed on track to a sustainable pace of expansion .
 moderate growth in gdp in the staff forecast is expected to be associated with some slowing in borrowing by nonfinancial sec- tors in the remaining months of the year .
 business requirements to fund inventory accumulation are diminishing , and borrowing for share retirements is likely to pause a bit before accelerating later this year and early next year to finance the consummation of recently announced mega - merger deals .
 in the household sector , debt should continue to expand around its recent pace , further increasing debt - to- income ratios .
 a pickup in mortgage financing in association with a little stronger residential housing activity will tend to be offset by a modest slowing in growth of consumer credit as repayments on loans for big - ticket items catch up with the earlier surge in extensions .
 credit should be readily available to private borrowers , though we expect an end to the trend of easing terms and conditions as lenders reassess risk and returns in an environment of moderate real income growth and rising debt of households and businesses .
 very large retirements of tax - exempt bonds and anemic gross issuance will further drag down the stock of tax - exempt debt , and , in the federal sector , debt growth in the near term is projected to slow even apart from debt - ceiling disruptions .
 consequently , as shown in the table below , total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at a 3 - 3/4 percent rate over the final five months of this year , placing this aggregate in the fourth quarter 5 percent above its year - earlier level .

 growth rates based on alternative b .",0," the choice of the higher rates of alternative c would seem to rest on concerns about the longer - term inflation outlook .
 as noted , in the staff forecast , inflation holds steady through 1996 , and , with no slack in the economy at the end of the forecast period , would not be expected to decline appreciably in 1997 . if the commit- tee were intent on making measurable progress toward price stability in the next several years , a rise in the real federal funds rate from its current level would seem to be needed based on the relationships embodied in the staff forecast . to be sure , unexpected developments could reduce inflation pressures , perhaps by putting slack in the economy , but there can be no assurance of such a surprise on either the supply or demand sides .
 the need for a tightening of policy - reestablish a disinflationary trend might seem all the more pressing if the firmer spending data of late and the brisk pace of broad money growth , with the economy already producing around its potential , were seen as suggesting risks on the side of more inflation than in the staff forecast .
 intermediate- and long - term rates also would in- crease , with the extent of the rise depending on whether market par- ticipants saw the action as implying more underlying strength in aggregate demand and greater inflationary pressure than currently envisioned or whether this tightening were interpreted as suggesting more resolve by the committee to bring inflation down .",0.5,,,0.0
43,1995-09-26," if the committee saw reasonably high odds of more restrictive effects on the economy than the staff forecast , it might favor an easing of the funds rate , as under alternative a . such effects would come at a time when the economy already is expected to be expanding at a rate less than the growth rate of its potential and with monetary policy possibly seen as also on the restrictive side .
 in july , the committee reversed only a portion of the move toward policy restraint it made last winter when the risks to the economy of rising inflation were much larger .
 real rates across the maturity spectrum remain elevated by historical standards , though , to be sure , the level of equilibrium real rates is uncertain .
 moreover , real rates could move up a little further over time with an unchanged funds rate , as current expectations of a policy ease were frustrated .
 the downward adjustment of short - term market interest rates that would accompany the unanticipated implementation of alternative a would be a little smaller than the 1/2 percentage point cut in the funds rate operating target .
 market participants may well interpret the action as responding to prospective fiscal restraint or to receding inflation pressures , so inflation expectations might not react adversely .
 on the other hand , they are not likely to project significant further rate cuts pending new information on these fac- tors , limiting rate decreases .
 on balance , the associated declines in intermediate- and longer - term interest rates probably would be smaller than the fall in short - term rates , which is the historically typical market reaction .
 the dollar 's exchange value could be expected to extend its most recent decline .",-0.5," although the data received over the intermeeting period have strengthened market participants ' conviction that federal reserve easing has become more likely by year - end , only a small probability of a move at the september meeting is seen .
 thus , choice by the commit- tee of alternative b 's unchanged funds rate likely would engender just a minor increase of short - term rates .
 any immediate reaction in bond or foreign exchange markets should be muted .
 over the upcoming inter- meeting period , economic reports consistent with the subdued growth in the staff forecast could keep alive expectations of subsequent mone- tary easing , allowing intermediate- and long - term interest rates to remain near current trading ranges .
 the exchange value of the dollar would be little changed .
 of course , markets may be buffeted by developments in the legislative process suggesting shifting odds on the extent of deficit reduction .
 without serious disruptions to governmental operations , federal debt growth should slow from its pace earlier in the year to a 3 - 1/4 percent annual rate over the last four months of the year .
 federal debt growth would continue at a 4 - 1/4 percent pace over the same interval .
 for businesses , borrowing will remain below the first half of the year , held down by lower inventory investment and slower growth in capital spending ; the composition of borrowing , however , should tilt back toward the bond market .
 for households , some pickup in mortgage borrowing should counter a further moderation in consumer credit . concerning credit supply conditions , banks remain comfortably positioned to lend , although the growing strains on households may lead to a little more caution in this area .
 as shown in the table be- low , total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to ex- pand at a 4 percent rate over the final four months of this year , placing this aggregate in the fourth quarter
 a little more than 5 per- cent above its year - earlier level .

 the broad monetary aggregates are expected to grow over the remainder of this year somewhat more rapidly than forecasted in the last bluebook .
 the additional projected strength primarily owes to the recent decline in market interest rates , both short- and long- term , which has further narrowed the opportunity costs of holding retail money balances.4 under alternative b , m2 is projected to grow at a 5 - 3/4 percent rate over the final three months of the year .
 m3 is foreseen as expanding at a 6 percent rate , somewhat faster than the staff 's projection of bank credit expansion , reflecting the an- ticipated ongoing shift from nondeposit to deposit sources of funding .
 in the fourth quarter , the velocities of both monetary aggregates would continue to decline , albeit at a reduced pace .
 m2 in the fourth quarter would be quite near the top of its 1 to 5 percent annual growth cone , while m3 would be well above its 2 to 6 percent annual growth range .
 ( a table showing the growth rates of the monetary aggregates over the balance of the year under each of the alternatives is attached . )
 m1 is expected to continue to decline over the remainder of the year , at about a 1 - 1/2 percent rate under alternative b , as still more banks introduce sweep accounts that transfer funds automatically from now accounts to mmdas to reduce reserve requirements .
 assuming about $ 10 billion of additional sweeps over the last three months of the year , revised up from $ 3 billion in the last bluebook , this effect will reduce the m1 growth rate over the last three months of the year by 3 - 1/2 percentage points and over the four quarters of 1995 by 2 - 3/4 percentage points .

 target ranges : 1 to 5 2 to 6 directive language",0," the 1/2 percentage point policy tightening of alternative c could be favored if the inflation performance projected by the staff to accompany an unchanged federal funds rate were seen as repre- senting an insufficiently rapid approach to the committee 's ultimate objective of price stability .
 indeed , the staff forecast shows very little downward tilt to inflation rates .
 moreover , the current un- employment rate is a little below the staff 's estimate of the nairu , and economic growth going forward at a pace below potential is by no means assured -- especially in light of current bond rates and stock prices .
 on the basis of relationships embodied in the greenbook alternative simulation , a policy tightening of the dimensions of alternative c would nudge economic growth to below 2 percent over the next two years , opening up enough slack in labor and product markets to make more noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and beyond .
 the 1/2 percentage point hike in the funds rate of alternative c would catch market participants off guard .
 their inter- pretation of the action , of course , would be conditioned by the word-
 ing of the accompanying announcement , which presumably would emphasize more aggressive pursuit of the committee 's longer - run price stability objective .
 in that context , the sharp jump in money market interest rates may be accompanied by a much more muted increase in bond yields , if longer - term inflation expectations were favorably affected .
 if the impact on inflation expectations were negligible , though , an appreci- able selloff in the bond market could result .
 in any event , some intermediate - term rates -- real and nominal -- would rise significantly as market participants revised up their expected path for short - term rates for some time into the future .
 the exchange value of the dollar likely would strengthen .",0.5,,,0.0
44,1995-11-15," the choice of easing under alternative a might be favored if it were thought that some information about spending -- for example , soft industrial commodity prices and a sluggish manufacturing sector or slowing growth of broad money and credit -- was suggesting a weakening in aggregate demand not yet evident in more general statis- tics .
 these indicators might be signalling that real interest rates already have been on the high side , and these rates could be rising further , especially at the short end of the maturity spectrum , in light of the recent decline in inflation and , most likely , inflation expectations .
 in effect , the downward slope to the near - term yield curve and narrow spread of the entire curve could be signalling that real short - term rates are above those consistent with moderate growth , especially in the face of impending fiscal restraint .
 the cut in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points under alternative a would come sooner and be larger than now expected in the market .
 consequently , it would show through to other money market interest rates , and banks would trim 1/2 percentage point off the prime rate .
 the dollar would be expected to weaken on foreign exchange markets as interest rates on dollar - denominated assets fell in relation to those on other major currencies .
 the sustainability of any decline in bond rates would depend on whether market participants similarly saw the easing to be called for or rather viewed it to be premature and unsustainable , as might become the case if indicators in the period just ahead were broadly in line with the staff forecast .",-0.5," the greenbook forecast assumes no significant macro- economic effects from any temporary disruptions incurred in the process of determining the longer - run stance of fiscal policy .
 as noted above , the current funds rate is judged to be consistent with core consumer inflation staying at about 3 percent .
 despite the lack of a downward tilt to the inflation projection , the committee still might favor the unchanged stance of policy in alternative b if it viewed the benefits of further disinflation as insufficient to justify a more restrictive policy stance that pushed the economy below its potential .
 the case for alternative b would be even stronger if the committee viewed the staff inflation forecast as too pessimistic-- either because spending would be weaker or because the price - output relationship would be more favorable than the staff assessment .
 a government shutdown would disrupt the normal flow of economic data .
 retail sales for october would be released on november 14 , but consumer prices would not be available on the next day .
 moreover , uncertainties about the economic outlook might seem par- ticularly large , both because of the fiscal situation and because of conflicting signals about spending and production .
 such circumstances could reinforce the desire to stand pat , awaiting clarification of the outlook .
 earlier expectations of the possibility of easing at the november fomc meeting have largely been erased and , thus , the choice of alternative b should have little impact on market interest rates .
 the dollar would trade on foreign exchange markets around its current level .
 although market attention over the intermeeting period is likely to remain focused on the budget deliberations , evidence of persistent strength in private final demands along the lines of the staff forecast might cause markets to begin to question their expecta- tions about the path of interest rates going forward , and intermedi- ate- and long - term rates could edge higher .
 the table below presents expected growth of money and debt under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative b . in credit markets , supply conditions are expected to remain generally favorable .
 however , the likely cutback in business lending by japa- nese banks and possible tendency for consumer lenders to become more selective suggest that credit may become less freely available for some borrowers .
 nonetheless , borrowing by nonfederal sectors is expected to firm a little from the subdued pace of recent months .
 for businesses , strong cash flow and some slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation will act to hold down financing needs , although this effect will be offset by the scheduled completion of some large merg- ers and associated share retirements in coming months .
 in the house- hold sector , debt growth will be sustained in the near term in financ-
 ing further healthy advances in durable goods outlays and fairly robust housing activity .
 total nonfederal debt is projected to expand at below a 5 percent annual rate over late 1995 and early 1996 .
 fed- eral borrowing will be light in the months immediately ahead , even absent a spending lapse or debt - ceiling crisis , before strengthening late in the winter .
 taken together , total nonfinancial sector debt is projected to grow 5 - 1/4 percent in 1995 , around the middle of its monitoring range , and to maintain that pace early in 1996 .
 annualized growth from m2 4 - 1/2 m3 5 - 1/2 m1 -1
 -1/2 debt 5 - 1/4 federal 7 nonfederal 4 - 1/2
 the broad monetary aggregates , especially m2 , are expected to strengthen after october .
 moderate nominal income growth and fairly narrow opportunity costs will tend to buoy expansion in household demand for m2 , helping to return growth in this aggregate to the 4 - 1/2 percent area over the october - to - march period under alternative b . the rebound in m2 growth , combined with still - brisk issuance of large time deposits to fund bank credit , would result in about 5 - 1/2 percent m3 growth under alternative b . as a consequence , m3 velocity would continue to decline over the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year , albeit at a slower pace .
 the velocity of m2 , in contrast , should edge up over these two quarters , reversing part of its unexpectedly large third - quarter decline .
 while , m1 is projected to remain on a downward trajectory , owing to the further spread of retail sweeps .
 for the year 1995 , the staff projects m2 to rise 4 - 1/4 percent , in the upper portion of its 1-to-5 percent range , and m3 to advance 6 - 1/2 percent , a little above its 2- to-6 percent range .
 in march of 1996 , both aggregates would be near the upper ends of their tentative ranges for next year .
 contingencies regarding a treasury default",0," the choice of alternative c might be favored to the extent that the committee wished to have greater assurance that infla- tion would continue to edge down .
 a more restrictive policy to accomplish this objective might be seen as all the more needed in light of recent strength in broad measures of output and labor input .
 furthermore , intermediate- and long - term interest rates have declined substantially in recent months , potentially providing considerable further impetus to spending .
 a move to tighten policy by 50 basis points as under alternative c would especially surprise market participants , who con- tinue to hold the view , supported by statements from some committee members , that the next policy move will be to ease .
 money market rates would rise by at least the 50 basis point increase in the fed- eral funds rate .
 the dollar would tend to strengthen on foreign exchange markets , and intermediate- and long - term interest rates would retrace some of their recent declines as a higher path for real short- term rates came to be built into market expectations .",0.5,,,0.0
45,1995-12-19," although market participants expect monetary policy to be eased over the next few months , a reduction of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate implemented at this meeting , as called for under alternative a , would be larger than generally expected .
 other short - term rates would fall appreciably , and the value of the dollar would probably decline on foreign exchange markets .
 the response of long - term yields would depend on the market 's interpretation of this action , which in turn could be influenced by the content of the announcement .
 bond rates might decline only modestly to the extent that the action were viewed as merely realigning nominal rates to the surprisingly damped inflation of the last half of the year .
 if mar- kets thought the committee were anticipating further moderation of inflation , especially as a consequence of underlying weakness in aggregate demand that implied lower real as well as nominal rates going forward , then rate declines would be more pronounced .
 such substantial reductions in bond yields would fuel additional increases in equity prices as investors discounted expected earnings at the lower rates .
 while there is some risk that market participants would interpret an easing as indicating insufficient regard for the longer- term inflation outlook , this risk would be greater for a 50 basis point cut than for a 25 basis point move .
 the latter is closer to market expectations and , judging from the yield curve , would be seen as consistent with moderate economic growth .
 thus , the smaller cut is less likely to spark major changes in market rates .
 under the staff forecast , alternative a would risk fostering greater inflation pressures , and the move would eventually need to be reversed .
 thus , choice by the committee of this alterna-
 tive would presumably be based on an assessment that aggregate demand is more likely to flag than under the staff forecast and that infla- tion and inflation expectations are more likely to decline .
 optimism on inflation might be based on the observation that inflation has come in lower than expected at mid - year and inflation expectations have abated significantly .
 as a consequence , real short - term rates are perhaps higher than the committee had anticipated when it established the 5 - 3/4 percent funds rate .
 the good performance of the economy in the face of these real short - term rates may be seen as reflecting in part the rally in capital markets , which , however , has been based to a degree on expectations of policy ease .
 in the absence of policy action , real longer - term interest rates and exchange rates would be pushed higher , and an easing could be based on concern that these higher real rates risked an unduly sluggish economy in the future .
 indeed , the favorable inflation - output mix of the second half of 1995 might be seen as indicating that the economy is capable of operating on a sustained basis at a higher level of output and hence lower levels of real interest rates than in the staff forecast .",-0.5," in these circumstances , adoption of the unchanged money market conditions of alternative b could prompt a small backup in market interest rates .
 the rise in yields is likely to be damped , as investors would continue to expect monetary policy easing before long .
 the sense that policy action was merely postponed would be more pro- nounced if a budget agreement had not been reached by the time of the committee meeting .
 maintenance of the current monetary policy stance over time , however , particularly after a budget agreement has been struck , would lead market participants to reexamine their expectations for monetary policy . if they saw the current 5 - 3/4 percent funds rate being sustained for a considerable period in the context of a satis- factorily performing macroeconomy , then long - term rates might ulti- mately rise by no more than the approximately 1/2 percentage point "" surprise "" in the funds rate .
 such an increase would reverse only a small portion of the drop in rates over the last year , returning nominal long - term rates to about their levels of late summer , while leaving real rates perhaps a bit higher than they were at that time given the downward drift in inflation expectations over recent months .
 the greenbook forecast embodies a backup of longer - term yields of this magnitude with a flat federal funds rate through most of the forecast period .
 nonetheless , because the staff assessment is that aggregate demand will be slightly stronger than implicit in financial markets or the blue chip survey , the higher trajectory of interest rates is seen as consistent with output remaining close to potential and inflation running around 3 percent over the next two years .
 accordingly , in the staff forecast , alternative b keeps policy on a path that produces results for economic growth and inflation over 1996 closely in line with the committee 's expectations for next year that were reported in july .
 the table below presents staff forecasts for money and credit growth for the november - to - march period under the unchanged money market conditions of alternative b .7 broad measures of money 7 .
 the forecast for m2 is presented in terms of the current defini- tion but would differ little under the revised definition , to be implemented early next year , that excludes overnight rps and euro- dollars . and credit are expected to pick up some in coming months , partly in conjunction with stronger growth in nominal gdp .
 credit supply condi- tions should remain favorable under that outlook , especially for firms .
 households reduce their borrowing a bit in view of slackening growth of spending on durables and rising debt - service difficulties , but growth of their debt still outpaces that of nominal income .
 ness borrowing picks up , buoyed by a brisk pace of merger deals .
 although firms are drawn to the bond market by attractive long - term rates , borrowing from shorter - term sources , including banks , remains substantial .
 total debt growth accelerates to a 5 percent pace over the november - march period , leaving domestic nonfinancial sector debt near the middle of its provisional 3-to-7 percent monitoring range .
 annualized growth from m2 5 - 1/4 m3 5 - 3/4 m1
 -3 - 3/4 sweep - adjusted 1 - 3/4 debt 5 - 1/4 federal 6 - 1/2 non - federal 4 - 3/4
 in the staff forecast , bank credit growth edges up in the next few months from its recent depressed rate , as banks stop running off securities .
 with japanese branches and agencies already having shifted financing to their home offices or other affiliates , the runoff of cds at these institutions should wind down , so that going forward depository institutions as a whole rely more on liabili- ties in m3 to finance credit growth .
 expansion of m3 picks up to a 5 - 3/4 percent annual rate over the november - to - march period under alternative b . m2 growth also firms from its unexpectedly weak pace so far in the fourth quarter .
 the projected rebound in nominal income growth supports an acceleration of retail deposits , and the lagged effects of recent declines in short - term rates and associated reduc- tions in opportunity costs also buoy money demand .
 m2 would be just above the upper end of its provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range in march , and m3 would be at the upper end of its tentative 2 to 6 per- cent range .",0," with market participants expecting an easing rather than a tightening of policy , the 50-basis - point increase in the federal funds rate under alternative c would lead to a sharp jump in other money market interest rates .
 yields on intermediate- and longer - term issues would likely rise as well , as real interest rates expected over coming quarters firmed considerably , and probably by more in the short run than any decline in inflation expectations .
 the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would increase appreciably .
 the fomc might select alternative
 c if it saw the risks to inflation at current interest rates as reasonably well balanced and wished to gain more assurance of making longer - term progress toward price stability .
 despite declines this year , survey - based measures of inflation expectations have only reached levels of recently observed inflation and still do not anticipate further disinflation .
 given the demand and inflation relationships incorporated in the staff forecast , the rise in the federal funds rate under alternative c would tilt the inflation rate down slightly in 1997 .
 with the economy already operating in the neighborhood of its potential and aggregate demand possibly bolstered by the sharp declines in interest rates of the past year , an increase in inflationary pressures can not be ruled out .
 although growth of the standard monetary aggregates has been slow recently , the broad aggregates have expanded fairly briskly for 1995 as a whole , and credit through intermediaries and in the securities markets remains readily available .",0.5,,,-0.25
46,1996-03-26," given the staff 's assessment of the economy , the 1/2 percentage point easing in reserve market conditions offered under alternative a would boost the economy marginally further beyond its potential and tilt the inflation rate up a bit more noticeably .
 with the latter outcome apparently inconsistent with the committee 's strategy for achieving its long - run goals , adopting alternative a would seem to require that , relative to the staff , committee members expect somewhat weaker spending or better inflation .
 for example , policy relaxation might be seen as buying further insurance against the risk that the recent rise in bond yields would truncate the ap- parent strengthening in activity this year or as attaching weight to the possibility that the nairu is lower .
 in light of the uncertainty about the current economic situation and the widespread expectation that system policy is on hold , it is difficult to gauge how market participants would react to the 1/2 percentage point of policy ease envisioned under alternative a .
 it is safe to say that most of the decline in the federal funds rate would carry through to other shorter - term market rates .
 market participants might read the action , coming on the heels of 1/4 point moves at two successive meetings , as revealing the judgment of policy makers either that the economy could work with a thinner margin of unused capacity without higher inflation or that aggregate demand is weaker than most analysts are now expecting .
 with market participants particularly uncertain about the economy , they might give the commit- tee the benefit of the doubt , at least for a while , and infer from the policy action that the economic situation had changed .
 in that cir- cumstance , intermediate- and long - term rates could fall significantly .
 alternatively , this policy easing might be seen to reflect a misread- ing of the economic situation or evidence that the committee was will- ing to tolerate upside risks to inflation in the interest of stimulat-
 ing growth for a time .
 should this interpretation predominate , infla- tion expectations would rise ; although real interest rates probably would fall , the prices of debt instruments could come under downward pressure .
 under all these scenarios , the foreign exchange value of the dollar would weaken , and especially so if inflation expectations deteriorated .",-0.5," an unchanged policy stance , as in alternative b , would probably be preferred if the committee concurred with the staff 's as- sessment of the economy , viewed potential risks as about evenly balanced , and was willing to accept the possibility of a slight inten- sification of price pressures .
 of course , this alternative might be even more attractive if the committee saw smaller odds of rising in- flation , as it did in january judging from the cpi forecasts submitted by the members .
 moreover , in light of the unusual number of temporary disruptions and distortions to economic activity in the last few months and the difficulties in understanding the implications of the recent movements of stock and bond prices , a pause might be favored to allow sufficient time to establish a firmer bearing on the likely course of spending and inflation , even if the committee saw the risks to the outlook as possibly tilted to one side or the other .
 with market participants apparently expecting no policy action over the next few months , maintenance of current reserve condi- tions , as under alternative b , would elicit little reaction in credit markets .
 capital market prices could remain volatile as incoming information continues to be difficult to interpret in the wake of the winter 's economic disruptions .
 although the anticipated softening of many indicators in march , such as payroll employment and industrial production , might boost markets for a time , data consistent with the staff forecast would seem , on balance , to imply little net change in longer - term yields .
 market participants have largely discounted any chance of a multi - year budget agreement before the elections , so a renewal of meaningful negotiations on long - term deficit reduction has the potential to raise bond and stock prices .
 absent such a develop- ment or unanticipated changes in policy abroad , the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would remain around its current level .",0," a 1/2 percentage point tightening in reserve conditions , as under alternative c , might be favored if the committee agreed with the staff forecast but viewed its outcome for inflation as undesir- able , particularly if the committee wanted to make some progress to- ward price stability .
 indeed , given that the economy is already operating at or beyond many estimates of its potential , the committee might see significant upside risks to the inflation forecast .
 in this regard , the recent behavior of asset prices and some financial ag- gregates could potentially be signalling inflationary pressures .
 part of the rise in bond yields might be associated with higher inflation expectations , and the gains in equity markets have the potential to provide excessive stimulus to spending .
 moreover , the broad monetary aggregates have been growing rapidly of late , suggesting ample li- quidity in household balance sheets and readily available funds for depositories .
 relative to the staff forecast , a 1/2 percentage point firming in reserve conditions would take a little pressure off re- source markets , raising the odds that the inflation rate would not tend to drift higher .
 the 50 basis point tightening of alternative c would catch market participants unawares and show through to instruments at the shortest maturities .
 the response further along the term struc- ture of interest rates could also be substantial , as the action would likely be interpreted as suggesting that the federal reserve saw con- siderable inflation risks .
 even so , the rise in longer - term rates likely would reflect a significant real component and the dollar would tend to increase on exchange markets and stock prices to weaken .",0.5,,,0.0
47,1996-05-21,,N," despite these potential problems on the inflation front , the minimum wage has not yet been raised , measures of industrial prices and of strains on production capacity remain quiescent , and recent information on core ppi / cpi inflation provides little evidence of an incipient acceleration .
 moreover , the rise in intermediate- and long - term rates this year may have left these measures not far from levels consistent with the economy producing at its potential .
 in these circumstances , the committee may prefer to adopt alternative b , 3 .
 some supply shocks could also raise the nairu and reduce poten- tial output by more than they would damp aggregate demand , increasing the equilibrium real interest rate .
 while a minimum wage hike prob- ably falls into this category , an increase of the magnitude currently being debated would not have much impact on the equilibrium real rate . awaiting more concrete evidence that inflationary pressures are emerg-
 ing before adopting a tightening action .
 financial market partici- pants are anticipating that the fomc will leave its policy stance unchanged at this meeting , implying that selection of alternative b would have little market impact .
 although the greenbook is forecast- ing a strong second quarter , many market economists have a similar view , and hence release of economic data in conformity with the green- book forecast should not elicit much response in security prices or dollar exchange rates .
 the interest rates of alternative b and associated staff forecast for the economy are thought to be consistent with a slight moderation in the growth of money and credit over coming months relative to their pace of expansion so far in 1996 .
 ( projected growth for april to september and from the fourth quarter to september are shown in the table below . )
 the staff anticipates that the terms and conditions of bank lending will remain on the accommodative side , though perhaps continuing to firm a little for consumer credit .
 only partly as a consequence , growth of consumer credit is projected to continue its downtrend , accompanied by sustained moderate expansion of home mortgage debt .
 business borrowing may edge off as the recent rise in long - term yields continues to restrain bond issuance , while subdued inventory investment keeps the lid on bank loans and commer- cial paper .
 near - term borrowing by the federal government is now shaping up as rather weak in light of the build - up in the treasury 's cash balance stemming from outsized individual tax payments in april .

 even without an assumed minimum wage
 crease , the committee may see the gradual upcreep in core cpi infla- tion projected by the staff as a likely and undesirable outcome .
 if the higher rate of overall inflation so far this year were feeding through in some part to inflation expectations , a rise in the nominal funds rate would be needed at some point to forestall an effective easing of the policy stance .
 the federal reserve is not expected by market participants to tighten for several months , and hence , investors would be caught off guard by the fomc 's choice of alternative c at this meeting .
 short - term interest rates would rise by 1/2 percentage point .
 a sense that the fomc would be assuming a more aggressive anti - inflationary posture than previously anticipated , at least over the near term , might limit increases in nominal intermediate- and long - term rates , but would lead to an appreciable increase in real interest rates on instruments of these maturities .
 the value of the dollar would probably ratchet higher on exchange markets .",0.5,,,0.0
48,1996-08-20,,N," nonetheless , the committee may well feel that it can afford to wait , as in alternative b , for additional data to accumulate to allow a more confident judgment concerning whether an underlying process of rising inflation seems to be taking hold .
 arguably , the upturn in the compensation trend is not firmly established in a statistical sense , leaving questions about the level of the nairu .
 and even if wages have begun to accelerate , the profit share may be sufficiently high to cushion the extent to which faster increases in labor compensation are passed through to prices for a time .
 even if the staff assessment of emerging price pressures is confirmed , with the economy still close to its potential , the pickup in inflation would be gradual .
 consequently , as long as a slowdown in real gdp growth of the dimension foreseen by the staff still appears to be in train , the case for an immediate policy tightening may not be seen as compelling .
 while keeping policy on hold for a time in these cir- cumstances might imply the need for a greater tightening later to reverse the pickup in inflation , so long as the action were not post- poned too long , a wrenching adjustment to output should be avoidable .",0," the committee instead may wish to implement the 25 basis point increase in the intended federal funds rate involved in alternative c . especially in light of the recent low level of initial claims and the upside potential for inventory stocking , the committee may question the staff forecast that economic activity is likely to down- shift in the near term by enough to stabilize resource utilization .
 alternatively , even if the committee does expect growth in real ag- gregate demand soon to line up with that of potential output , it may be troubled by the strains on resource availability and the uptrend in core inflation embodied in the staff forecast .
 particularly with the upward pressure on prices from the minimum wage hike , a rise in the nominal funds rate would be necessary at some point just to keep the real rate from falling and thus the stance of policy from effectively easing , unless the economy is appreciably weaker or output - price tradeoffs considerably more favorable than the staff predicts .
 an immediate tightening of 1/4 percentage point would increase the like- lihood of holding the line against an upcreep in core inflation by better ensuring an eventual relief of pressures on resources .
 such a tightening might be viewed as a fairly typical policy reaction to the revision to the outlook since the committee last eased at the end of january .
 from the february monetary policy report to that in july , the members ' central tendencies for real gdp growth and cpi inflation for 1996 were revised up by 1/2 and 1/4 points , respectively .
 in light of these revisions and their implications for the longer - term outlook , an immediate 25 basis point tightening , or perhaps one of 50 basis points , would be even more warranted if the committee were seek- ing to move policy over time to a stance restrictive enough to put a downward tilt to the inflation rate in 1997 and beyond .
 given the recent adjustment to their expectations for monetary policy , market participants would be somewhat surprised by a committee decision to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points , as under alternative c . other short - term market rates would immediately adjust upward by a like amount .
 because the likely trajectory of short - term interest rates would be higher over the in- termediate run than previously expected by the market , some increases in longer - term interest rates and in the exchange value of the dollar would occur .
 the size of the upward adjustments would depend in part on whether the market saw the policy firming as an isolated event or the first of a series of policy tightenings .
 some market participants apparently sense that the committee may require extra evidence to change direction in monetary policy , and hence might assume that committee members now see the potential inflationary situation as having worsened appreciably and may be contemplating more than one small move .
 in that regard , the announcement accompanying the policy tightening presumably could provide some guidance to the market on these matters .",0.25,,,0.0
49,1996-09-24,,N," the committee thus might view such an inflation outcome as unacceptable .
 nonetheless , there are reasons why the committee might choose the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b for the upcoming intermeeting period .
 although labor markets are tight and wages accelerating , the extent and timing of any feedthrough of this acceleration to overall compensation and ultimately prices remain uncertain .
 real interest rates are in the neighborhood of levels that over the past fifteen years have been associated on average with little change in inflation , and the growth of money and credit has been moderate , suggesting perhaps that if the stance of policy is stimulative , it may not be greatly so .
 indeed , the staff forecast has only a gradual pickup in core inflation , which in any event will start from a level in the third quarter that is probably lower than the committee had anticipated .
 in these circumstances , waiting to assess better the economic situation might not incur much risk of a signifi-
 ca nt deterioration in inflation expectations , provided the delay were not too long , because containing inflation will still be possible before it has risen appreciably above the general level of recent years .
 moreover , the soft cast to the recent trend of retail sales and continued surprisingly favorable readings on broad price indexes may lead the committee to consider the staff forecast as too pessimis- tic about likely inflation pressures .
 if so , inflation is more apt to be kept within acceptable bounds without policy adjustment .
 with market participants apparently placing greater than even odds on policy tightening at this meeting , interest rates would likely decline and the dollar weaken on foreign exchange markets if the unchanged policy of alternative b were adopted .
 even before the discount rate story earlier this week , markets had built in close to 50/50 odds of a slight policy tightening , and alternative b probably would trigger rate declines that not only reversed the increases associated with the story , but some of those registered earlier in the intermeeting period as well .
 many would likely view the committee as merely delaying policy action until the november meeting rather than changing its fundamental assessment of the potential inflation threat , and this reaction would tend to limit the decline in long - term rates .
 there is a risk that policy inaction would induce some in the market to question the committee 's commitment to holding down inflation , or its willingness to take forward - looking action to do so , which would tend to boost inflation expectations .
 given uncertainties about the outlook and the perceived lack of a policy consensus within the federal reserve , markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to new economic data and to indications of committee members ' inclinations .
 in view of slower - than - expected m2 and m3 growth in recent months , the staff has revised down projected growth for those aggregates in 1996 .
 m2 is now expected to increase at a 4 - 1/2 percent rate this year and m3 at a 5 - 3/4 percent rate under alternative b , somewhat below the upper ends of their growth ranges for the year .
 over the august - to - december period , the expansion of m2 is projected to pick up to about a 4 - 3/4 percent pace , broadly in line with gdp growth under alternative b . the pickup in m2 should show through to m3 , and growth in the latter is forecast to strengthen to a 6 percent rate over the final four months of this year , abetted by a strengthen- ing of the expansion of bank credit .
 continued large sweeps of other checkable deposits and demand deposits will distort measured m1 .
 deed , m1 is projected to run off at about a 5 percent annual rate over the august - to - december period , while expansion of sweep - adjusted m1 increases to a 6 - 1/2 percent rate .

 in the alternative scenarios in the greenbook , an increase of one percentage point in the federal funds rate over the next year is sufficient to tilt core inflation down .
 a 25 or 50 basis point tightening at this meeting could be seen either as a first installment in moving more deliberately toward lower inflation , or as a more limited action aimed at holding the line .
 with labor markets tight and wage gains already strengthening , the committee may see it as only a matter of time before total compensa- tion puts sufficient pressure on profit margins to prompt businesses to raise their prices faster .
 especially if aggregate demand has more momentum than in the staff forecast , waiting for very long to tighten , given the lags in the effects of monetary policy , risks embedding some rise in inflation and inflation expectations into the economy and financial markets .
 that result would necessitate more aggressive and potentially disruptive policy action at a later date to return infla- tion to recent levels .",0.5,,,0.0
50,1996-11-13," a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate , as under alternative a , might be favored if the committee viewed the recent softness of final sales as likely to persist .
 under those circumstances , inventories may turn out higher than firms desire , imparting an additional drag on production over the next couple of quarters .
 but even if the staff forecast of spending is accepted , the committee may view the recent favorable performance of wages and prices as suggesting that the natural rate of unemployment is still lower than that implicit in the staff 's inflation forecast .
 if so , the economy may not have overshot its potential , and price pressures may be weaker than in the staff forecast .
 while some talk has surfaced in the market that the next policy move might be toward ease , participants do not foresee a reduction in the intended federal funds rate at this meeting .
 a 50 basis point reduction in the funds rate , as under alternative a , would most likely be read as evidence that the committee has serious reservations about the prospects for spending .
 in this event , sizable reductions in nominal and real market yields would likely be induced across the term structure .
 however , the easing might also be taken by the market as revealing a greater willingness on the part of the committee to risk an uptick in inflation as it undertook to test the upside of potential output .
 if doubts about the committee 's resolve to contain inflation were to become prevalent in the market , which might be especially likely should incoming data indicate buoyant spending or increased inflation pressures , nominal intermediate- and longer - term yields could begin to reverse their initial declines .
 in any case , the dollar would most likely weaken on foreign exchange markets .",-0.5," if the committee views the staff forecast as both likely and acceptable , it presumably would favor standing pat -- alternative b . even if the committee found unacceptable the forecasted upcreep in core inflation ( abstracting from technical cpi adjustments   , it might want to wait for more evidence that such an outcome is in train before taking action .
 the overutilization of resources may be seen as staying modest in any event , and thus policy inaction at this meeting would not seem to risk allowing inflation to rise so much that jarring adjustments to employment and output would be required eventually .
 with market participants widely expecting policy to remain on hold for some time , the committee 's selection of alternative b should elicit little response in financial markets . assuming that developments over the intermeeting period play out in accord with the staff projection , which appears aligned with most market forecasts , there is no reason to anticipate that interest rates will break out of their recent range .
 similarly , the dollar should trade on foreign exchange markets around its recent levels .
 in coming months , offering rates on m2 accounts are not expected to change much under alternative b , maintaining opportunity costs at around their recent levels .
 m2 growth over the october - to- march period is expected to quicken to a 4 - 1/4 percent rate from the unexpectedly weak advance in september and october , reflecting the projected speedup in nominal spending in the staff
 forecast.4 this 4 .
 the introduction of new retail sweeps is expected to continue at a rapid pace in coming months .
 as a result , m1 is anticipated to decline at a 9 percent rate over the october - to - march period under alternative b ; adjusted for sweeps , m1 would increase at a 3 - 3/4 percent rate over that span .
 from october to march , the monetary base is projected to grow at a 1 - 1/2 percent annual rate , but abstracting from sweeps , the growth rate would be 4 - 1/2 percent .
 strengthening in m2 does not show through to m3 , as banks lessen their net issuance of managed liabilities , and the broader aggregate is seen as expanding at a 6 - 1/4 percent pace over the next five months .
 the implied growth of m2 for 1996 as a whole is 4 percent , in the upper half of its range , compared with a 4 - 1/2 percent rate projected in the september bluebook .
 the growth of m3 for the year is projected at 6 percent , at the upper bound of its range and slightly higher than the 5 - 3/4 percent rate forecast for this aggregate in the previous bluebook .

 directive language",0," a policy tightening , such as the 50 basis point firming of the federal funds rate under alternative c , might be favored should the committee wish to move promptly to counter the updrift in underlying inflation embedded in the staff outlook .
 furthermore , the committee may be concerned about additional upside risks to the inflation outlook : for example , recent wage data may be misleading and the widely reported tightness of labor markets could be reflected soon in much more sizable increases in labor costs .
 or spending might snap back more forcefully than envisioned by the staff -- especially in light of the recent rallies in bond and stock markets -- and intensify pressures on resource utilization .
 the choice of alternative c would come as a surprise to market participants .
 most likely , they would infer that the committee sees considerably more risk of greater inflation pressures than is generally perceived .
 interest rates could rise markedly across the term structure -- perhaps almost as much at short - term maturities as the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate .
 higher real interest rates would be likely to boost the dollar on foreign exchange markets .
 financial prices could be volatile for a time as market participants reappraised the economic outlook and the likely path for monetary policy , and appreciable declines in equity values can not be ruled out .",0.5,,,0.0
51,1996-12-17," a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate ( alternative a   would seem to require a judgment that the upward pressure on prices is less than in the staff forecast at current interest rate levels .
 for example , the staff might have underesti- mated the extent to which forces such as job insecurity are pulling down the natural rate of unemployment .
 if so , lower short rates might be consistent with the same inflation outlook .
 essentially , policy easing would reflect the implied drop in the equilibrium natural real rate of interest and the narrower output gap and reduced price pressures associated with higher potential .
 in addition , the extraordinary slowing in consumer credit growth could be interpreted as indicating a developing problem in credit markets that will have greater implications for consumer spending than the staff has allowed , despite the recent uptrend in retail sales and favorable anecdotal reports on christmas spending .
 because the market is not expecting a change in policy , a 50 basis point funds rate reduction , as in alternative a , would show through completely to other short - term rates .
 the market would probably interpret the action as signaling that the committee saw inflation risks as considerably less pressing than previously thought .
 this view would have credence given the federal reserve 's current reputation for anticipating economic developments , and hence real and nominal interest rates likely would decline along the maturity spectrum , the exchange rate would drop , and the stock market would move higher , providing an impetus for spending over the inter- mediate run .
 the decline in nominal yields on longer - term instruments might be somewhat muted , or ultimately even reversed , were incoming data to turn out more consistent with the staff outlook .",-0.5," nonetheless , the need for an immediate policy tightening could be questioned .
 the estimated output gap and underlying inflation pressures in 1997 and 1998 in the staff forecast are fairly modest .
 moreover , the committee may be quite uncertain that there would be any deterioration in inflation , in light of the relatively good behavior of prices recently in the face of both a drop in the unemployment rate below most estimates of nairu and adverse supply side shocks in food and energy prices .
 moreover , levels of key financial variables going forward may seem especially uncertain , given the exceptional volatility in bond , stock , and foreign exchange mar- kets recently .
 such skittish market conditions may make responses to policy actions particularly hard to predict .
 in these circumstances , the committee may wish to keep policy unchanged ( alternative b ) , awaiting more information to assess how markets may evolve and how the other uncertainties may be resolved .
 with market participants almost universally expecting policy to be on hold for a time , the committee 's selection of alternative b would prompt little response in financial markets .
 expectations about the economy built into credit markets appear to be similar to those of the staff , and new information in agreement with that outlook over the intermeeting period should be associated with both interest rates and the exchange rate of the dollar averaging near recent levels .
 however , signs of significant progress in the political process in resolving budget and entitlement controversies probably would spark a rally in bond and stock markets .
 under alternative b and the staff forecast , both debt and money should expand at moderate rates in coming months , in line with projected nominal gdp .
 for the debt of nonfinancial sectors , the outlook implies a slight pickup in growth from the pace of recent months to a 4 - 3/4 percent rate from november to march .
 the contri- bution by governments at all levels should remain relatively modest , as state and local governments retire debt out of the proceeds of advanced refundings and the federal government continues to pare its budget .
 but somewhat stronger borrowing is expected by nonfinancial firms facing a widening financing gap , and household sector borrowing
 should bounce back somewhat , with debt growth more consistent with moderate increases in spending and income .",0," a 50 basis point firming of the funds rate ( alternative c   might be favored if the committee wished to move promptly to stem the rise in underlying inflation in the staff forecast and increase the odds on making some headway on its longer - run objective of price stability .
 with persistent indications of tightness in labor markets , some firming in wages , and disappointing news on reported productivity , the committee may see significant risks of a resurgence of inflation that could elevate inflation expectations and ultimately prove costly to wring out of the economy .
 such concerns might be accentuated if the committee saw the run - up in share prices as likely to persist , boosting spending above that in the staff forecast , and as indicative of an accommodative monetary policy that would eventually show through to the prices of other assets and goods and services .
 the choice of alternative c would surprise market participants and perhaps lead them to reconsider their view on the federal reserve 's longer - term objectives .
 real interest rates would rise , but participants might see the federal reserve as more determined to reduce inflation , with beneficial effects on inflation expectations .
 given the events of the last several days , however , the market could interpret the move also as importantly motivated by efforts to cap or even drive share prices lower .
 the resulting drop in equity values would be an important channel for reducing the excessive aggregate demand that presumably would motivate policy tightening .",0.5,,,0.0
52,1997-03-25,,N," nonetheless , a number of considerations regarding the outlook might induce the committee to forgo tightening at the march meeting , as under alternative b . the fact that resource utilization rates have been close to current levels for several quarters , with no sign that the underlying trend of price inflation is moving higher , might suggest that the economy may not in fact have overshot its long - run potential .
 in light of this possibility , the committee may want to wait to see more definite indications that price pressures are likely to intensify before tightening -- for example , additional increases in resource utilization or in wage inflation .
 moreover , even if a tightening is needed , the committee may perceive no urgency , especially in light of the projected decline in total cpi inflation this year , which , in turn , would help restrain inflation expectations .
 were the committee to wait to see if the unemployment rate declines , or if temporary factors damping compensation growth like health care savings or worker insecurity diminish , sufficient lead time may still be available to prevent tight labor markets from being translated into a materially higher rate of general price inflation .
 even should the upturn in wage inflation already observed be sustained or become steeper , it still could be largely absorbed for a time in reduced profit margins or matched by faster productivity growth , rather than passed through quickly to prices .
 finally , the enthusiasm of international investors for the dollar may prove more lasting than anticipated by the staff , restraining inflation pressures in 1998 and beyond relative to the staff forecast .
 with market participants apparently placing high odds on a 25 basis point tightening in the federal funds rate at the march meeting , interest rates probably would fall somewhat if the unchanged policy of alternative b were adopted .
 nonetheless , many observers would likely continue to view tightening as inevitable , unless economic growth slows to an unexpected degree , and these expectations would limit the decline in long - term rates and any softening in the dollar .
 indeed , if data in the weeks ahead come in as the staff projects -- strong real gdp growth and the unemployment rate declining -- both short- and long - term interest rates would back up , with long - term rates possibly more than reversing any initial rally .
 under alternative b and the staff forecast , debt is expected to continue to grow around its recent pace in the months ahead , while money growth tends to moderate as the expansion of nominal gdp slows .
 the debt of nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at a 5 percent rate from february to june , paced by the business and household sectors .
 business borrowing picks up somewhat , as capital spending remains strong , while flows of internal funds level out .
 for households , although credit is likely to become somewhat harder to obtain for marginal borrowers , overall consumer debt should remain on its recent moderate growth path .
 m2 growth from february to june under alternative b is projected to slow to a 4 - 1/2 percent rate , reflecting the deceleration in nominal gdp .
 by midyear , this aggregate will likely be near the upper edge of its 1-to-5 percent annual range .
 expansion of m3 should ease relative to its unusually rapid pace of earlier this year , as the torrid growth in money funds slows to a more sustainable rate and depositories resume a more typical balance of financing between deposits and non - deposit funding sources .
 from february to june , m3 is projected to increase at a 6 percent rate , leaving it well above the upper end of its annual range .

 c levels in billions monthly growth rates quarterly averages growth rate from to 1.0 to 5.0 2.0 to 6.01997 annual ranges : directive language",0," the committee might choose to increase the federal funds rate , perhaps by the 50 basis points of alternative c , in order to lean against the likely buildup of inflation pressures .
 recent strength in aggregate demand suggests that interest rates are not high enough to restrain economic growth over the near term to the likely rate of increase in potential , so resource use probably will be moving more decidedly above sustainable levels .
 the alternative simulations in the greenbook imply that substantial tightening is needed over the balance of the year to forestall a lasting increase in the rate of inflation .
 because of lags in the effects of policy , delaying the tightening process for long in these circumstances would increase the amount that the real funds rate eventually would have to be raised to reverse the impetus imparted to the inflation process , amplifying the associated swing in real gdp .
 even if the committee is not as pessimistic as the staff on the inflation outlook , some firming may still be warranted to improve the balance of risks facing the economy .
 robust final demand and lean inventories would suggest that the likelihood of significant economic weakness is small at present and that the economy should retain significant forward momentum even after a tightening .
 with demand strong , only unusual , persistent increases in productivity or in labor force participation would avert added cost and price pressures at some point in the future if the current funds rate is maintained .
 given these current risks , a tightening action might seem especially appropriate if the committee sought to improve the prospects for progress over the next few years toward its long - run price stability objective .",0.5,,,0.25
53,1997-05-20,,N," despite the staffs perception that underlying inflation pressures will be building , the committee may find reasons to leave its policy stance unchanged , at least for the time being , as incorporated in alternative b , which keeps the intended federal funds rate at 5 - 1/2 percent .
 in the greenbook forecast , the expansion of real gdp abruptly slows by enough to keep resource utilization from increasing further .
 the committee may feel that there is a reasonable chance that the rates of resource use in the forecast could be associated with more subdued inflation than the staff expects .
 data becoming available since the last meeting indicate a continuing damped response of prices and costs to unemployment rates that were once regarded as well below sustainable levels , underscoring the heightened uncertainties of recent years about the relationship between resource use and inflation .
 even if labor costs do accelerate as the staff projects , the higher profit share of late could provide an even greater buffer against the effects on prices than the staff has assumed , damping inflation rates for some time to come .
 the argument for standing pat would be stronger still if one gave appreciable weight to the notion that real short - term interest rates already had moved to relatively high levels , providing some insulation against the risk that overly rapid economic growth would resume .
 many analysts continue to predict that the committee will tighten policy at this meeting .
 however , in recent weeks , markets appear to have removed all but modest odds of any action , and the choice of alternative b should trigger a relatively minor decline in rates .
 as the intermeeting period progresses , incoming evidence confirming the staff forecast of markedly slower second - quarter growth in real gdp and still - quiescent inflation readings could further erode expectations of policy firming , fueling additional price gains in fixed- income markets .
 as an exception , the recent decline in the three - month bill rate should begin to unwind significantly with the approach of renewed net bill issuance in july .
 the exchange value of the dollar probably would fluctuate around its recent lower levels or even drift lower .
 the runoff of the tax - related deposit surge of april should be completed in may , after which the monthly growth of m2 and m3 under alternative b is expected to stabilize at annual rates of 4 - 1/2 and 6 percent , respectively , through september -- somewhat below the pace of the first five months of the year .
 quarterly average growth of m2 in the second and third quarters would be a touch below the staffs projected average pace for nominal gdp of 4 - 1/4 percent over the two quarters , reflecting the lagged effects of higher opportunity costs stemming from the policy firming in march .
 m3 growth is expected to ease slightly , though still remain strong .
 rapid money fund growth and some further shifting toward large time deposits and away from overseas funding of bank assets will continue to sustain growth in this aggregate , even in the face of a substantial slowing in bank credit growth .
 as shown in the charts , the staff anticipates that m2 will have grown at a 4 - 3/4 percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1996 through september , just below the 5 percent upper end of its annual range , while m3 will have expanded at a 6 - 3/4 percent rate over the same period , well above the 6 percent upper bound of its annual range .

 dec jun aug feb directive language",0," the 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate under alternative c would come as a major surprise to financial market participants and likely would spark a considerable rise in interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar .
 future expected real short rates could shift up appreciably over a relatively long time horizon as the market saw the action as reflecting an fomc view , which the market may find persuasive , that inflation pressures over the near term were likely to be stronger than the market had previously anticipated and an intention to contain those pressures through further aggressive policy tightenings .
 the higher real interest rates for discounting future business profits , along with possibly greater downside risks to those profits , could take a considerable toll on equity prices as well .
 it is possible , though , that the market would see such a prompt substantial firming as enough to hold inflation in check , or even reduce price pressures , without the need for any future tightenings .
 in these circumstances , upward revisions to expected future interest rates would be appreciably smaller , and the selloff at the longer end of the maturity spectrum considerably more limited .",0.5,,,0.0
54,1997-08-19,,N,"-- under alternative b , the intended federal funds rate would be kept at its current level of 5 - 1/2 percent .
 despite the updrift in inflation projected by the staff , the committee may elect to maintain the current stance of monetary policy for the time being by choosing alternative b . regardless of any longer - term risks , any likelihood of losing substantial ground against inflation in the period just ahead appears to be remote : inflation expectations seem to have declined in recent months , which should help to moderate for a time any turnaround in actual price increases ; and , at this stage of the investment cycle and with consumers already having responded to their increased wealth , the odds on a marked upside surprise in final demand would seem to be lower than they might have appeared earlier .
 moreover , the real federal funds rate has been rising this year from an already high level , owing to the committee 's firming of policy in march and the apparent decline in inflation expectations since then , providing some assurance that policy is not substantially too accommodative .
 financial aggregates could be read in the same light , with both m2 and debt , the two aggregates most closely related to nominal gdp , expanding moderately.3 in the staff forecast , the rise in inflation is gradual , so that once the potential for an upswing in inflation became more clearly evident , the committee should have time to act before the economy 's long - run health were seriously threatened .
 indeed , whether the structure of the economy has changed in ways that make it somewhat less inflation - prone , at least for a time , than allowed for by the staff projection remains an open question .
 market participants uniformly do not expect a near - term policy move by the federal reserve , and selection of alternative b by the committee should elicit little imme- diate market reaction .
 thus , short - term interest rates generally would remain close to current levels , as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar , though treasury bill rates could continue to edge up as supply constraints ease further with the seasonal widening of the 3 the relatively brisk advance of m3 seems to be driven primarily by the funding choices of depositories and well as shifts in business cash management practices favoring money funds , both of which bear little relationship to cyclical pressures .
 federal deficit .
 in longer - term markets , prices are likely to remain more volatile than over the spring and early summer as participants assess incoming data for clues about whether the recent exceptional confluence of strong growth , high levels of resource utilization , and low inflation can persist .
 however , data over the intermeeting period consistent with the staff forecast would likely prove somewhat reassuring in this regard , because they would show the economy growing at a moderate pace and inflation remaining damped .
 in these circum- stances , long - term yields could move lower over the weeks ahead .
 under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b , m2 is projected to grow at a moderate 4 - 1/2 percent rate on average over the remaining months of the year , around the expected rate of expansion of nominal gdp , leaving this aggregate a little below the upper limit of its 1 to 5 percent growth range for the year .
 the increase in m3 is likely to slow somewhat , as factors that have temporarily been boosting managed liabilities in that aggregate dissipate , but m3 growth will probably continue to be fueled by a shift in institu- tional cash management toward money market funds .
 this aggregate is expected to finish the year more than a percentage point higher than its 2 to 6 percent annual range , somewhat above the staffs projection in the july bluebook .
 although the federal government will shift to being a net borrower in credit markets over the balance of the year , the growth of its debt will be restrained by the narrow deficit .
 at the same time , the level and pattern of borrowing by private sectors is not anticipated to change significantly , producing moderate growth in the debt of all nonfinancial sectors -- near the middle of its 3 to 7 percent range and in line with nominal gdp .

 if the committee wants more insurance against the possibility that inflation will begin to pick up , and especially if it wishes to tilt the odds a little in the direction of further progress toward price stability over coming years , it may wish to raise the intended federal funds rate at this meeting , perhaps by the 25 basis points of alternative c . with strong demand over the past year and a half propelling the economy beyond the level of its estimated potential , real short - term rates might be seen as having been below their equilibriums .
 one reason for this situation may be that , despite a high real federal funds rate relative to its historical average , financial market conditions evidently have been supportive of spending -- spreads faced by private borrowers are quite narrow and equity prices remain at a high level .
 although inflation performance has been surprisingly good of late , the effects of a stronger dollar have played an important role that is not likely to be repeated in the next few years , and signs of resurgent labor militancy may indicate reduced worker insecurity .
 although inflation expectations have fallen , the recent volatility in financial markets suggests that in those markets such expectations may not be firmly anchored , and could turn around reason-
 ably quickly once inflation begins to pick up .
 in those circumstances , delaying policy action ultimately could turn out to be costly in terms of economic performance .
 with no near - term tightening expected , the market response to implementation of alternative c could be sharp .
 short - term market rates would jump by the full 25 basis point increase in the funds rate ; the prime rate likely would be lifted by an equivalent amount .
 bond markets would sell off as well .
 investors would have difficulty interpreting such an action in light of developments over the intermeeting period , and their response might be shaped in part by the federal reserve 's announcement .
 participants might well think that the action represented a one - time adjustment to rebalance risks , in which case the response would tend to be muted .
 but more pronounced decreases in bond prices can not be ruled out because investors might interpret the action as signifying that the federal reserve had reassessed its fundamental outlook and now saw a more serious and sustained inflation threat that would call for further tightening actions .
 if so , the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets probably would strengthen considerably .
 in either case , equity prices almost certainly would fall , as real interest rates rose , and the decline could be considerable if capital losses spurred investors to reexamine their assumptions regarding the risks of equity investments .",0.25,,,0.0
55,1997-09-30,,N," the staff assessment of the pressures on resources implies that policy restraint is in order at some point to check an upcreep in inflation , but the committee may , nonetheless , prefer to hold the federal funds rate at its current level of 5 - 1/2 percent at this meeting , as in alternative b . over the past few quarters sustained high levels of resource utilization have been associated with flat or , by some measures , even declining inflation .
 the committee may read this experience as suggesting the possibility that economic activity can run on the high side of historical norms without putting much pressure on inflation .
 even in the staff forecast some of the moderate pickup in consumer prices owes to a smaller drag from import prices as , by assumption , the dollar stabilizes .
 additional impetus to inflation comes from a projected further decline in the unemployment rate .
 given these uncertainties attending the prospects for inflation , the committee might be willing to defer putting restraint in place so as to get more readings on the pace of stock - building , the strength of final sales , and the behavior of wages and prices .
 a willingness to await new information might be reinforced if the committee were of the view that any current misalignment of policy was modest at worst .
 some reassurance in this regard might be gotten from the likelihood that the real fed funds rate has ticked higher in recent months , as inflation expectations seem to have declined along with the drop in measured inflation , while the nominal funds rate has been held steady .
 with scant indications of pipeline pressures that normally presage a pickup in inflation , and with business profit margins perhaps ample enough to absorb a portion of any speed up in cost increases , the committee may well have time to act before an incipient increase in inflation becomes firmly embedded in inflation expectations .
 virtually no one in the market anticipates action at this meeting , so that yields across the term structure are not likely to budge much and the dollar should continue to trade around its current level on foreign exchange markets immediately following the adoption of the unchanged policy stance of alternative b . treasury bill rates have been depressed of late by low issuance , and the turnaround in bill sales in the fourth quarter prompted by the seasonal bulge in the federal deficit may roll back some of the decline in rates on those securities .
 over time , if economic developments unfold as in the staff forecast , market participants are in store for some disappointment : inflation will be a touch faster , providing a context in which expected strength in readings on economic activity are more likely to be taken as evidence that higher real rates are required to slow spending to contain price pressures , and corporate profits should decelerate . against this backdrop , nominal yields would likely edge higher , with both their real and inflation compensation components rising , and equity prices would likely decline .
-- ( 10 ) under the unchanged policy stance of alternative b , the growth of the monetary aggregates should slow significantly .",0," if the committee were confident that the staff had correctly identified the threat that inflation would pick up , or wanted some greater assurance of further progress toward price stability , it would likely favor raising the federal funds rate promptly , perhaps at this meeting by the 25 basis points of alternative c .
 the need for prompt action might be seen as elevated because the vigor of final sales threatens to add to pressures on resources , and the longer the economy operates beyond its sustainable potential , the more disruptive may be the correction needed to contain inflation . despite relatively high short - term real rates , financial conditions remain quite supportive to spending : the stock market continues to generate impressive gains in wealth ; longer - term real interest rates seem to have held fairly steady or perhaps edged lower since spring ; and capital markets and depositories remain quite receptive to borrowers .
 the rapid growth of the monetary aggregates in the past few months may be seen as one more warning flag that financial conditions are supporting more spending than can be accommodated without an increase of inflation .
 while the committee might be more inclined than ever to view structural changes as permitting the economy to operate at a higher rate than in the past , the projected unemployment rate of 4 - 1/2 percent falls short of all but the rosiest estimates of the natural rate .
 moreover , a portion of the recent good performance of inflation has owed to temporary factors , such as the strength in the foreign exchange value of the dollar , which are not likely to be repeated over coming quarters .
 even worker insecurity may be expected to erode in a strong labor market marked by reduced layoffs .
 with those beneficial forces likely to wind down , the committee may fear that the effects of strains on resources may show through more forcefully to the prices of goods and services than in the staff forecast , perhaps more in line with traditional relationships .
 the committee 's choice of alternative c at this meeting would catch market participants completely unawares .
 money market rates would rise at least as much as the 25 basis point hike in the federal funds rate , and intermediate- and long - term rates could increase substantially as well .
 the extent of the increase , of course , would depend on market participants ' interpretation of the rationale for federal reserve action .
 the action might be viewed as simply a purchase of limited additional insurance against higher inflation in response to a spurt to final demand .
 alternatively , the tightening might be taken as evidence that the federal reserve had not become as optimistic as market participants have come to suspect it was about the economy 's ability to produce at unusually high rates without generating more inflation ; such a reassessment might even lead some investors to revise their own views about inflation as well as about future federal reserve behavior .
 in either case , the implied rise in real rates would buoy the exchange value of the dollar but depress equity values .
 stock prices might be doubly hit if confidence in the expected growth of earnings were shaken not only by the prospects for tighter policy but also by a less favorable view of the long - run path of potential output .
 in these circumstances , incoming data bearing on the strength of spending and inflation pressure would be especially scrutinized , and large swings in financial prices might become even more common .",0.25,,,0.0
56,1997-11-12,,N," the continuing string of data suggesting stronger real activity and softer inflation than expected has provided evidence that , at least in some respects , economic behavior is deviating from historical patterns .
 in those circumstances , knowing at what point resource pressures will induce cost and price acceleration -- and hence when preemptive policy actions would become warranted -- is difficult , making a "" wait - and - see "" posture more attractive .
 despite the recent strength in aggregate demand , the current policy stance still could turn out to be consistent with sustainable economic expansion and subdued inflation .
 indeed , inflation expectations probably have receded even further of late ; certainly that would be consistent with the narrowing spread between yields on the treasury 's nominal and inflation - protected securities .
 by itself , this development should restrain the wage- and price - setting process .
 moreover , the fall in inflation expectations has further raised real short - term interest rates , which should work to restrain spending over time , other things equal .
 the staff anticipates that , under alternative b , m2 and m3 will grow at annual rates of 4 - 1/2 and 6 - 1/4 percent , respectively , over the five months from october to march of next year .
 over the fourth and first quarters , quarterly average growth rates for the two aggregates of 5 - 1/4 and 7 - 1/4 percent are anticipated , compared with a greenbook forecast of 5 - 1/4 percent on average for nominal gdp .
 the standard measure of the opportunity costs of holding monetary assets is effectively unchanged over the next two quarters as the policy tightening assumed by the staff starts toward the end of that interval .
 the updrift in m2 velocity observed in the last few years should be muted in the period ahead , because some investors will likely choose the safety of m2 assets over increased exposures in equity markets .
 the sizable downtrend in m3 velocity is expected to persist .
 bank credit is expected to expand at around a 6 percent rate over the five months , supported in part by strong business lending to help finance continued investment in plant and equipment , so m3 growth likely again will be bolstered relative to that of m2 by still - rapid issuance of large time deposits as well as by inflows into institution - only money funds .
 for this year as a whole , m2 is seen as growing at the 5 percent upper end of its range , while m3 is expected to expand 2 percentage points faster than the 6 percent upper bound of its range .",0," if the committee shares the staffs assessment that the u.s . economy has overshot its sustainable productive potential , it may be disposed to tighten its policy stance , as in the 25 basis point rise in the funds rate in alternative c . with markets still somewhat unsettled , the extent of their reactions to a policy tightening is especially difficult to gauge , and the odds that those reactions , both in the united states and abroad , could be outsized are probably higher than usual .
 under these circumstances , if the committee were inclined to tighten , it might consider waiting until it had greater assurance that domestic and foreign financial markets have quieted further .
 the committee would be led to raise rates if it judged the threat of an inflationary uptrend to be serious enough to justify a preemptive policy initiative , even in the absence of any evidence in hand of actual acceleration in prices .
 in light of the persistent strength of final demand to date , the likely effects of recent financial market events on the u.s .
 inflation outlook could well be seen as too minor to assuage committee concerns about intensifying inflationary forces .
 the committee may judge that the impacts of weaker economies and currencies in asia on u.s .
 export volume and import prices will be relatively limited .
 also , given the small net size of the stock market decline , the cost of equity capital may be seen as remaining low enough , when combined with the still accommodative credit conditions for businesses in securities markets and at financial intermediaries , to undergird continued heavy investment spending .
 similarly , household financial wealth may be regarded as remaining elevated enough , when considered together with likely persisting employment gains and still high consumer confidence , to keep consumption spending on a strong path .
 a policy tightening -- even if delayed until markets stabilize -- likely would induce further sizable downward adjustments to stock prices , and bond prices as well , and bolster the exchange value of the dollar .
 however , these market responses could be viewed as a necessary aspect of the transmission of monetary policy restraint .
 for example , in the staff forecast , a decline of around 20 percent in stock prices over the next year or so is a key element in limiting the rise in inflation .",0.25,,,0.0
57,1997-12-16," the 25 basis point easing of alternative a might be favored if the committee were concerned that turmoil abroad might have an even greater impact on the u.s . economy than the staff has built into the forecast .
 given the favorable near - term inflation outlook for the united states , the committee might see insurance against such an outcome to be relatively inexpensive in that the easing likely could be reversed , if that proved necessary , before it boosted inflation and inflation expectations .
 indeed , such an easing , by lowering real dollar interest rates might contribute a little toward stabilizing foreign markets , helping to forestall some repercussions in the united states .
 moreover , the recent weakness in commodity prices and the shallow slope of the yield curve may support the view that real short - term rates are high relative to their equilibrium .",-0.25," while the economy continues to operate in the staff forecast at a level above estimates of its potential , inflation remains quiescent for some time with no change in the federal funds rate and stays relatively low over the forecast period .
 even if the committee is concerned about the pressures on labor resources and finds the eventual uptrend in underlying inflation unacceptable , it may be willing to keep the funds rate constant at this meeting , as under alternative b . in the staff forecast , the emergence of inflation has been pushed back enough to suggest that delaying possible firming to await further information about global and national economic developments runs minimal risk of embedding higher inflation and inflation expectations in economic decisionmaking .
 the situation in a number of foreign markets and economies remains quite unsettled , amplifying uncertainties about the extent of the global retrenchment and its implications for the u.s . financial markets and economy .
 the circumstances are sufficiently fluid that the committee might see some possibility of a major economic retrenchment , which could be exacerbated by a preemptive tightening of u.s .
 monetary policy at this time .
 under alternative b , the committee would be buying time to assess the extent to which developments abroad restrain aggregate demand , depress oil prices , and support the dollar , as well as the degree to which recent momentum in the economy might be sustained .
 more data might also be seen as especially useful in sorting out some of the questions about underlying pressures on labor compensation and the extent to which productivity behavior might damp the feed - through of higher compensation to profit margins and prices .
 the markets expect no policy action over the next few months and would react little , if at all , to the choice of alternative b . apart from year - end effects , interest rates-- especially treasury yields -- should fluctuate close to recent lows over the intermeeting period .
 any tendency for rates to edge higher if foreign markets settle down should be offset by the effects of more moderate economic growth , as in the staff forecast .
 stock prices , however , could drift down as economic reports begin to undermine the prospects for profits .
 in these circumstances , investors might reevaluate credit risk more generally , and spreads on bonds could widen a touch further .
 the market for treasury securities might , from time to time , be buffeted by the fallout from developments in asia .
 on occasion in recent weeks , the treasury market has weakened temporarily on the expectation of official and private sales of treasuries for purposes of addressing financial difficulties in asia , and such events could well recur over the weeks and months ahead .
 however , by themselves , such sales are unlikely to have much lasting effect on dollar yields because they do not change the fundamental outlook for prices and spending in the united states .
 moreover , they should be easily absorbed into markets benefiting from demands for safer assets and from reduced borrowing by asian financial institutions to the extent they repay dollar liabilities with the proceeds of their asset sales .
 growth of the broad money aggregates is expected to moderate from the recent rapid pace , as the expansion of nominal gdp slows in the first quarter .
 m2 growth is projected at around a 4 percent annual pace over the november - to - march period under alternative b , leaving this aggregate near the upper end of its provisional 1998 range .
 nonetheless , growth in m2 would again outpace that of nominal gdp in the first quarter of 1998 , and m2 velocity would edge lower .
 m3 should slow by more than m2 over the november - to - march period , as growth in bank credit ebbs and some of the shifting in the composition of bank managed liabilities diminishes .
 nonetheless , growth in m3 - -at a 6 - 1/2 percent rate -- is expected to run above the upper end of its provisional range for 1998 .",0," the 25 basis point tightening of alternative c might be favored if the committee wanted to lean against the inflationary bias that may well be inherent in the current and prospective tautness of labor markets .
 the further tightening of labor markets this fall indicates that financial conditions prevailing over recent quarters have not been sufficiently restrictive to hold economic growth to a sustainable pace .
 with real bond rates no higher -- and perhaps even a bit lower -- than over the last few quarters , equity prices still high , and monetary growth above expectations , only the rise in the dollar gives any hint of the firmer financial conditions needed to damp strong aggregate demands . against this background , and with labor markets already extremely tight , the committee might perceive that counting on sufficient additional restraint coming from asian developments runs an unacceptable risk of a rebound in inflation in 1998 that would be disruptive to reverse .",0.25,,,0.0
58,1998-03-31," if the committee saw substantial risks of a significantly weaker economy than in the staff forecast , it might want to move promptly to ease policy , perhaps by lowering the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point , as in alternative a . such a risk to aggregate demand might arise not only from greater asian effects than currently anticipated , but also from weaker domestic demand .
 some of the recent robust expansion in the latter may be temporary , owing importantly to the net decline in oil prices since last fall and to the drop in intermediate- and long - term interest rates prompted by expectations of impending weakness from asia .
 the rate declines and robust economy , in turn , have bolstered business and consumer confidence and the stock market .
 as restraint from the external sector is felt more fully , especially if it appears to be more severe or prolonged than the public now expects , the unwinding of buoyant psychology and the drop in equity prices could cause a more pronounced damping of domestic demand than the staff anticipates .
 the committee may see the current relatively low inflation rate as justifying a more forceful and prompter reaction to this possibility than might have been appropriate at higher inflation rates , especially in light of the tendency to overpredict inflation over the past few years .
 inflation has declined by more than the committee or the staff had expected , raising the prospect that , should those disinflationary forces persist and be overlaid by an unexpected shortfall in aggregate demand , inflation could fall farther than the committee would find desirable .
 the 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative a would translate to nearly comparable reductions in other short - term rates .
 in the market for intermediate- and long - term securities , rates could decline appreciably if the easing were viewed as confirmation that the federal reserve saw a pronounced slowdown resulting from the asian crises , making further reductions more likely .
 the dollar could fall on foreign exchange markets , and lower interest rates would help the stock market hold close to its recent record level .",-0.25," the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b might be favored if the committee saw the staff forecast as a likely outcome and one that appropriately balanced the goals of restraining inflation and sustaining expansion over the next few years , or , at a minimum , if it viewed the risks of substantially different and less desirable outcomes on either side of the staff forecast as about equal at the current federal funds rate .
 even if the committee suspected that the odds were tilted a bit either toward a stronger economy and greater price pressures or toward a weaker economy and more disinflation than desired , awaiting additional evidence to indicate better the direction of the economy might not be too costly in current circumstances .
 for example , if underlying pressures in labor markets intensify , the effects of lower import prices should damp inflation and inflation expectations for a time , permitting the committee to tighten before significantly higher inflation becomes embedded in wage and price decisions .
 conversely , in the event of greater drag from asia than anticipated in the staff forecast , the underlying strength of domestic demand appears to be strong enough to sustain economic expansion for a while until an easier policy is adopted and has time to take hold .
 because financial markets are placing very low odds on a change in policy in the near term , the choice of alternative b would likely have little immediate impact on domestic financial markets or the exchange value of the dollar .
 however , were incoming data on the economy to confirm that growth is moderating appreciably while inflation remains subdued , as in the staff forecast , market participants might again build in greater odds on a policy easing , perhaps on the view that the high real funds rate does indicate a restrictive policy stance .
 if so , intermediate- and long - term rates , along with the dollar , could edge lower .
 in the stock market , prices could come under some downward pressure even if interest rates drift down , as generally bad news on earnings come to be seen not as a one - time hit from the higher dollar or a temporary drop in demand from asia , but rather as the precursor of narrowing profit margins in a less robust economy .
 the softer earnings picture could also prompt a little more caution on the part of creditors and some widening of quality spreads .
 the implementation of policy may be complicated for a time after the mid - april tax date by high , though uncertain , treasury deposits at the federal reserve , which might require outsized reserve injections and extraordinary amounts of collateral to be pledged to the federal reserve by primary dealers .
 but any added volatility in the funds rate would be temporary and should have little , if any , effect on interest rates further out the yield curve .
 under the conditions of alternative b , the moderating pace of spending in the staff forecast should be accompanied by considerably slower growth in debt and money .
 the bulk of the slowdown in nonfederal debt growth will likely be accounted for by the business sector ; the financing gap is not projected to increase any further in coming quarters , and borrowing in recent months has been well above staff assessments of needs to cover mergers and acquisitions and the shortfall of internal funds from capital outlays .
 while some new caution by lenders is likely to surface as economic growth slows and profits soften , this shift in attitudes is expected to have only a marginal restraining influence on business credit growth .
 in the household sector , growth of debt is projected to continue to be well maintained -- outpacing that of disposable personal income - led by brisk mortgage borrowing as housing markets remain strong and as refinancing is associated with some further equity extraction .
 by september , debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to have grown at a 5 - 1/2 percent rate from its fourth quarter 1997 base , above the midpoint of its 3 to 7 percent annual range .
 the moderation in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates under alternative b owes in part to a slowdown in gdp and bank credit as business lending and acquisitions of securities slacken and
 banks become less aggressive in seeking funding .
 nonetheless , m3 is projected to grow at a 6 - 1/4 percent annual rate over the march - to- september period as depository credit growth still stays fairly brisk .
 as a consequence , m3 would stand 9 - 1/2 percent above its fourth - quarter base in june and 8 - 1/2 percent above that base in september .
 growth in m2 is projected to slow to a 3 - 1/2 percent annual rate over the march - to - september period .
 we are projecting that , in the absence of changes in opportunity costs , m2 growth in an underlying sense will return to a pace close to that of gdp in the period ahead .
 nevertheless , v2 is expected to decrease in the second quarter because of the effects on liquid balances of the current heavy pace of mortgage refinancing , as well as the high levels of tax refunds and anticipated april tax payments ; in the third quarter , however , v2 is likely to rise somewhat , as those refinancing and tax effects on deposit levels are removed .
 the deceleration in m2 brings growth from the fourth quarter of 1997 to june to a 6 - 1/2 percent pace , still above the 1 to 5 percent annual range for m2 , and to a 5 - 1/4 percent pace by september .
 directive language",0," data becoming available since the last meeting have suggested considerable economic strength and a tighter labor market .
 the attractive conditions in financing markets , the exceptionally high level of stock valuations , and rapid growth in money and debt may be viewed as corroborating the strong financial thrust in the economy , which would support domestic demand going forward .
 these factors have led the staff to revise up its own inflation forecast .
 while committee members may have anticipated some of this strength in demand over the intermeeting period , enough may have been a surprise so as to elevate or validate concerns about the prospects for a pickup in inflation .
 with the unemployment rate already likely below its sustainable level , this additional demand could lead to a steeper upward track for underlying inflation that would require more substantial and disruptive restraint the longer it is delayed .
 short - term rates would rise by the full amount of the 25 basis point tightening of policy under alternative c , which is unanticipated in the market .
 intermediate- and longer-
 term real interest rates would also rise substantially as markets reassessed their view of the federal reserve 's forecast and , perhaps , intentions , and the dollar could come under upward pressure .
 stock prices could well decline , especially if investors saw the tightening as worsening the outlook for corporate earnings as well as raising the rate of discount applied to future earnings , and such a decrease would be one element of the necessary restraint on aggregate demand .
 the generally healthy state of financial institutions in the united states would seem to suggest that the domestic financial system would be resilient to any fall in asset values that were to accompany such a policy tightening .
 most likely , financial markets in troubled emerging economies would not be greatly affected if the action were seen as limited and not portending a more generalized upward movement in rates in industrial economies .",0.25,,,0.0
59,1998-05-19,,N," if the committee views the greenbook forecast as both likely and acceptable , it might be inclined to maintain its current 5 - 1/2 percent intended federal funds rate , as under alternative b . although that forecast has an underlying upward tilt to inflation in 1999 as labor markets remain quite tight , that tilt is gradual and starts from a lower inflation rate in 1998 than the committee had anticipated only a few months ago , judging from the central tendencies of members ' cpi projections in february.2 even if the committee were troubled by the underlying uptrend of inflation in the staff forecast , it might still be willing to adopt the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b . the vulnerable state of many financial markets in asia , which could react adversely to an increase in u.s .
 interest rates , might weigh against action at this time .
 when the committee 's directive tilt was disclosed prematurely in late april , interest rates in those markets rose along with dollar interest rates , indeed by somewhat more than those here .
 in addition , the committee may feel that a small uptick in underlying inflation , should it unfold as in the staff forecast , would generate only minimal costs in potential resource distortions and could be readily countered in the future .
 if so , the committee may be willing to accept the significant probability of such an uptick through 1999 because recent experience has led it to place greater weight on the possibility that the economy will prove able to sustain the high operating rate built into the staff forecast without a rise in underlying inflation .
 under the stable money market conditions of alternative b , the staffs projected 2 - 1/2 percentage point moderation in the pace of nominal gdp from the first to the third quarter of this year should be associated with a noticeable slowdown in the expansion of the debt and monetary aggregates .
 household borrowing should slow along with spending on consumer durables and houses , and business demand for credit should subside as inventory investment downshifts substantially .
 still , the debt of both sectors is expected to exceed the expansion of income , with the upturn in debt - servicing burdens held down by recent and continuing refinancing of outstanding higher - cost obligations .
 while slower economic growth and narrower profit margins may make lenders a little more cautious , a significant restriction in credit availability does not appear likely , given the healthy financial condition of both borrowers and lenders .
 in the federal sector , outstanding debt should run off , even on a seasonally adjusted basis , reflecting the government 's widening budget surplus .
 from april to september , the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is foreseen as slowing to a 4 - 1/2 percent annual rate , bringing its average advance from the fourth quarter to 5 - 1/2 percent , somewhat above the midpoint of its annual range .
 under alternative b , m2 growth is expected to slow significantly to a 3 percent average rate over the april - to - september period , with a little more than 1 percentage point of the slowdown from the first four months of 1998 representing the projected unwinding of the previous artificial boost related to special tax and mortgage - refinancing factors .
 even so , over the second and third quarters , m2 growth averaging 5 percent on a quarterly average basis is projected to exceed the 4 percent average rate of nominal gdp expansion , implying a further 1 percent rate of decline in m2 's velocity .
 from the fourth quarter through september , implied m2 growth would be at a 5 - 3/4 percent rate .
 looking a little further out , the staff now envisions growth of this aggregate for the year at a 5 - 1/2 percent rate , putting it above the 1 to 5 percent annual range judged by the fomc to be consistent with conditions of price stability and stable velocity behavior ; this projection embodies a 1 percent decline in velocity in 1998 .
 projected m3 growth under alternative b would dip to a 5 - 1/2 percent rate from april through september , reflecting some expected reduction in the growth of depository funding needs associated with the anticipated marked slowing in depository credit expansion over that interval .
 the rapid rate of securities acquisitions of late 1997 and earlier this year , which appeared to be related to some large banks ' efforts to increase leverage , is expected to slow .
 the pace of lending , too , is likely to remain below that of the first four months of the year as credit demands moderate .
 from the fourth quarter through september , m3 is seen as advancing at an 8 - 1/2 percent annual rate , and for the year as a whole at 8 - 1/4 percent , well above the upper bound of its 2 to 6 percent annual range .

60,1998-08-18," in view of recent developments in global financial markets , the committee might be inclined to consider a 25 basis point easing of monetary policy , as in alternative a . aggregate demand in the united states apparently has already decelerated appreciably , and committee members may believe that the staff forecast does not give enough weight to ongoing deflationary forces coming from developments abroad .
 moreover , the staff forecast may be viewed as underplaying the restrictive effects of recent changes in u.s .
 financial markets , despite declines in some nominal yields : the dollar has strengthened on net against a broad basket of currencies ; u.s .
 equity prices have fallen significantly ; and declines in inflation expectations may have largely accounted for the decline in nominal interest rates , leaving real rates little changed .
 even in the context of the staff view of the economic outlook , with domestic inflation currently at low levels , the committee may be willing to risk a slightly less satisfactory outcome in terms of u.s .
 inflation performance to help foster a recovery in foreign economies , which would be in the long - run interest of the united states .
 lower interest rates would help ensure that domestic demand in the united states remains reasonably vigorous . and lower rates , along with somewhat less strength in the dollar , would benefit a number of foreign economies , even those with currencies not tied to the dollar ; for those in the latter group , credit - risk spreads would tend to decline as concerns about foreign debt repayment abated a bit , and the tendency for their currencies to appreciate would give them room to adopt a somewhat less restrictive monetary policy .",-0.25," if the committee found the staff forecast , with inflation and unemployment both staying relatively low , to be both a reasonable expectation and a desirable outcome , it presumably would maintain the current 51/2 percent federal funds rate , as under alternative b . the committee could still favor alternative b even if it saw higher inflation eventually , but was rather uncertain about its expectation of the eventual pickup in inflation , given the surprisingly favorable price performance of recent years .
 the odds on a significant price acceleration within a year or so may be seen as low ; in such circumstances , delay would not materially jeopardize the committee 's goal of containing inflation and would buy some time to accumulate information on the evolving dynamics of inflation and hence the need for tightening .
 moreover , the committee may want to weigh any concerns about higher inflation against the increasingly precarious conditions in global financial markets .
 the greater fragility of these markets evident over the intermeeting period may suggest that the potential for adverse effects of a tightening of u.s .
 monetary policy on other economies has risen further .
 with inflation low , aggregate demand apparently decelerating , and the outlook for asia quite uncertain , market participants anticipate no policy action at this meeting , and market interest rates are likely to be little affected by selection of alternative b . under the greenbook forecast , information about prospective corporate earnings is likely to disappoint investors , keeping equity prices from rebounding and possibly precipitating a further decline .
 absent such a decline , which could weaken the exchange value of the dollar as investments in the united states looked less desirable , the dollar should edge higher in coming months , most notably against the yen : the japanese economy is likely to remain weak and skeptical market participants probably will require substantial , concrete actions to deal with the financial system and the economy before confidence can begin to recover .
 should troubles in foreign markets intensify and spread further , the dollar would tend to strengthen more noticeably , equity prices would encounter additional downward pressures amid heightened worries about profits , and interest rates in the united states would continue to decline across the yield curve , reflecting both a more pronounced flight to quality and developing expectations of monetary policy easing .
 m2 and m3 are forecast to expand at 5 and 7 - 3/4 percent annual rates , respectively , from july to december under alternative b .
 the moderation in money reflects the expectation of slightly slower growth in nominal gdp over the second half of the year .
 in addition , the staff expects a less - rapid decline in m2 velocity in the second half , in part because the expansion of mortgage refinancing activity , which had boosted m2 growth over the first half of the year , comes to a halt .
 bank credit is projected to rise less rapidly in the second half of the year than in the first , reflecting a slowing pace of securities acquisitions as well as some moderation in loan growth , damping banks ' needs for funding through m3-type instruments .
 despite the slowing in m2 and m3 growth during the second half , both aggregates are expected to overshoot their annual ranges for the year as a whole.3 3 according to elasticities based on staff econometric models , a rise in the federal funds rate on the order of 1 - 1/2 percentage points at this meeting would be necessary to restrain m2 to its annual range by the end of this year .
 of course , this calculation does not capture any unusual reactions that might arise in current circumstances from a tightening of this magnitude .

 feb directive language",0," although the staff forecast envisions a relatively benign domestic macroeconomic outcome under current money market conditions , the committee might be concerned either that in the staff forecast progress toward price stability was stalling or that in its own view inflation was more likely to escalate noticeably .
 in either case , it may prefer to apply additional monetary restraint at this meeting , as in the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c . a prediction of worsening inflation pressures might be based in part on unambiguously tight labor market conditions and the uptrend already evident in wages and compensation .
 the odds on much softening of labor markets might be seen as low in light of the surprising momentum of domestic demand , which has been sustaining growth of employment and income .
 and while the committee recently decided not to tighten , in part because of unsettled conditions abroad , a continued absence of action would not be desirable if the committee were reasonably confident that the domestic economic situation was pointing to higher inflation rates before very long .
 in such a situation , delay would only increase the degree of tightening that would ultimately be necessary .
 delayed but greater tightening could be even more disruptive to financial markets , since economies abroad may not be sufficiently improved and markets sufficiently settled to absorb the heavier blow .
 markets would be somewhat unsettled by the 25 basis point firming action of alternative c at this meeting , which would come as a surprise .
 short - term market interest rates probably would back up by at least the rise in the federal funds rate .
 investors would project lower earnings and use higher discount factors , and equity prices almost certainly would fall significantly further .
 boosted nonetheless by higher interest rates , the foreign exchange value of the dollar likely would firm as well , with particularly large increases against the yen , and asian countries with currencies tied to the dollar would confront considerable pressures to adjust their pegs .
 longer - term dollar interest rates would probably jump initially in response to the rise in short - term rates , but might reverse course before long if market participants began to question the likely duration of the tightening move in view of the added strength in the dollar and lower equity prices ; still , real long - term rates are likely to remain at higher levels for a while .
 risk spreads on domestic private debt , as well as on the obligations of a number of foreign governments and firms , likely would widen noticeably .",0.25,,,0.0
61,1998-09-29," to begin addressing the weaker outlook for the u.s . economy , the committee may wish to reduce the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative a . now that the stock market has fallen and credit terms have tightened , the real federal funds rate probably can be reduced from its unusually high level without adding to inflation pressures .
 indeed , with 3 as of the july humphrey hawkins report , the central tendencies of the governors ' and presidents ' projections for 1999 were 2 to 2 - 1/2 percent for real gdp growth , 2 to 2 - 1/2 percent for cpi inflation , and 4 - 1/2 to 4 - 3/4 percent for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of inflation expectations possibly falling further in recent months -- as suggested by a much larger decline in the spread of nominal over indexed treasury yields than can be accounted for by the relative liquidity of these instruments - the real federal funds rate may even have edged higher .
 even if the committee 's outlook for spending is stronger than that of the staff , if it has been revised down substantially , a policy ease might still be called for .
 moreover , financial markets are fragile and , in the absence of signs of economic recovery and progress on key policy reforms in japan and other countries , the possibilities for disappointing outcomes abroad precipitating further contagion and restraint on spending in the united states may be seen as unacceptably high .
 a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this point could be viewed as providing a modicum of insurance against the risk of such very adverse outcomes .
 in addition to boosting domestic demand , a lower federal funds rate could be of some limited help in relieving pressures on emerging market countries , especially those tied to the dollar or finding themselves in need of defending the exchange value of their currencies through tight monetary policies .
 indeed , in recent days as an easing by the federal reserve has come to be seen as more likely , emerging market countries have witnessed some narrowing in spreads on their dollar - denominated debt and some improvement in their stock markets .
 if foreign outcomes proved not so disappointing or the domestic economy surprisingly resilient , the policy move could be reversed before long without raising questions about the federal reserve 's anti - inflation resolve .
 even if the committee suspected that more easing might eventually be needed , it might want to move by only 25 basis points at this time because of the residual inflation risks inherent in the unusually low unemployment rate along with the strength to date in the economic expansion .
 if the committee believed that , as in the staff forecast , a larger policy move were needed to have an adequate effect in forestalling oncoming weakness in economic activity or if it wanted to take more forceful action to address the risks facing financial markets here and abroad , it might choose to reduce the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting ( alternative a '   .
 depending on the wording of the announcement associated with such a move , the market might see the fomc as being on hold for a longer duration , eliminating for a little while market uncertainty about whether additional easings were in the offing .
 moves of 50 basis points have been somewhat unusual in recent years , and , in volatile financial markets with largely unanchored expectations , reactions are difficult to gauge .
 most likely , equity markets would rally and risk premiums on private debt would fall , as the fomc was seen as taking a more active stance in cushioning the effects of tighter financing conditions and weaker foreign demand on economic activity .
 but there is some chance that market participants could interpret the larger move as indicating that the federal reserve viewed the current economic situation as especially serious , perhaps owing to fragility in the financial sector .
 if so , the rebound in equities could be tempered while treasury bond prices could be strengthened further .
 in any event , the value of the dollar against major currencies would likely drop somewhat under this alternative.4 the prime rate would likely be reduced by 1/2 percentage point .
 in the staff forecast , m2 growth would be supported by declines in opportunity costs associated with the policy easings .
 5 within the aggregate , growth should be strong in liquid deposits , whose rates adjust relatively sluggishly to declines in market rates , while small time deposits should run off , as offering rates on these deposits tend to adjust faster .
 currency demand should remain strong , supported by ongoing turbulence abroad .
 money market mutual funds should be buoyed by the declines in market rates and continue to benefit somewhat from 5 the greenbook projection could be considered to be consistent with a 25 basis point easing at this meeting and a similar move toward the end of 1998 .
 those assumptions are used for the projections of money growth under alternative a . the reduced attractiveness of stock mutual funds , but to a lesser degree than over the past couple months ; the projected declines in stock prices are not as steep as those that already have occurred , and some of the money fund inflows at the onset of the bear market were likely only parked temporarily while in transit to alternative longer - term investments .
 on balance , m2 is projected to grow at a 6 - 1/2 percent rate over the next six months , implying further substantial declines in velocity .
 with economic growth softening and bank lending moderating , m3 is projected to decelerate to a 7 - 1/2 percent pace over september to march .
 the broad monetary aggregates will almost surely far exceed their growth ranges in 1998 ; m2 is projected to grow 8 percent this year and m3 to grow 10 percent.6 however , a good part of the recent and projected strength in the aggregates apparently reflects shifts in money demand rather than strong spending growth ; m2 has been boosted by heightened demands for liquidity and shifts away from stock market investments , while the elevated growth of m3 has in part reflected a substitution of bank funding sources for market financing by lower - rated business firms .
 6 the ranges for 1998 and the preliminary ranges for 1999 are 1 to 5 percent for m2 and 2 to 6 percent for m3 .
 directive language",-0.25," although the staff projection embodies a substantial weakening in aggregate demand , data to date suggest that the economy is growing near its potential rate .
 with labor markets still quite tight and forecasts in recent years often underpredicting economic activity , the committee may wish to have more evidence in hand that growth of aggregate demand is slowing considerably before easing policy .
 if so , the committee would find the unchanged stance of policy under alternative b appropriate .
 the recent tightening of credit supply conditions and drop in equity prices toward a more realistic alignment with earnings prospects may be viewed as necessary and overdue corrections that will help to prevent speculative and inflationary imbalances from developing .
 an easing at this time might risk inhibiting those adjustments and be viewed as an attempt to support overly optimistic investor and lender behavior .
 indeed , if corporate bond and equity prices rallied substantially , such a move could potentially court another sharp correction at a later date .
 with markets betting heavily on an easing at this fomc meeting , holding rates unchanged as in alternative b would leave investors confused about federal reserve intentions and likely engender added volatility .
 short - term treasury and private rates would back up sharply , and longer - term rates also would rise , though perhaps not by much if , as seems likely , market participants believed that the easing had merely been postponed .
 increases in treasury yields might be less than in private rates , if adverse reactions in financial markets strengthened 4 the reactions in financial and foreign exchange markets might be even larger if the discount rate were also reduced by 50 basis points , as such joint action might be seen as suggesting that the federal reserve is convinced that interest rates will remain low for a considerable period of time .
 flight - to - safety motives .
 a part of the recent improvement in foreign financial markets , which has been built on growing expectations of an easing in u.s .
 monetary policy , could be reversed , particularly in some especially vulnerable countries .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise , although this effect could be mitigated somewhat if the adverse effects on latin american markets were particularly severe .",0,,N,,,-0.25
62,1998-11-17," the committee may find such a pattern to be relatively attractive if it believes that the economy is operating beyond a sustainable level , but wishes to reduce the pressures on resources only gradually ; inflation still stays fairly quiescent , and financial markets strike a better balance between the frothy conditions of recent years and the extreme risk aversion evident in recent months .
 a slight additional easing at this meeting , as in the 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate of alternative a , could be considered broadly in line with the policy assumption underlying the staff forecast.2 the case for an immediate easing would be strengthened if the committee thought that the risks to the staffs economic outlook were distinctly skewed to the downside , perhaps owing to the possibility of more adverse developments in latin america .
 in addition , a prompt policy easing would be more likely than would standing pat to lessen the odds on a reemergence of anything like the earlier extreme reluctance to take on risk that had caused rates on private securities to back up and had threatened to retard economic activity .
 indeed , such an easing action might be expected to foster continued normalization of financial conditions here and abroad .
 an easing also might reduce the chances , or at least lessen the effects , of possible funding problems at some financial institutions , particularly around year end , that could interfere with credit intermediation .
 finally , an easing would help to offset some of the effects of both the tightening in lending terms and standards at commercial banks that has been under way and the softness in global economic activity that has been exacerbated by further weakness in japan .
 the 25 basis point easing of policy under alternative a would tend to boost most financial markets , given that the federal funds futures market evidently now has built in only about even odds of such an action at this meeting .
 consequently , rates on short - term private market instruments , such as commercial paper , likely would move a little lower following implementation of alternative a . with the easing perhaps fostering additional attenuation of concerns about private credit risks , the unusual recent safe - harbor demands for treasuries would 2 alternative a could be implemented either through a 1/4 percentage point reduction in the discount rate to 4 - 1/2 percent , or through a slightly more generous provision of nonborrowed reserves , with no discount rate change , that eliminates the spread between the two rates .
 abate further , and treasury bill yields probably would fall less than those on private instruments .
 similarly , in longer - term markets , private rates also likely would decline , as would those on older , less - liquid treasury notes and bonds , while yields for on - the - run treasuries might be little changed as more of the recent flight - to - liquidity is unwound .
 falling rates and improving liquidity in markets for private securities probably would augment the recent tendency for some rebound in trading volumes , and the better market conditions could help spur issuance , including some deals previously postponed because of market turbulence .
 the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets likely would decline somewhat , and financial strains in foreign markets probably would moderate further .",-0.25," if the committee finds the greenbook forecast plausible and acceptable , with the risks of upside and downside surprises reasonably balanced , it may wish to defer consideration of an easing action to later in the year ( the point at which the staff forecast assumes such an action will occur   to allow more time to assess the effects on financial markets and the real economy of the easing that it has already put in place .
 leaving policy unchanged at this meeting , as under alternative b , would seem even more advisable if the committee were skeptical that aggregate demand will slow to the extent forecast by the staff .
 there is some reason to be cautious in predicting much adverse effect on spending from financial developments .
 as noted , a number of indicators of market performance suggest that , at a minimum , the decline in asset prices and worsening of trading conditions have ceased and , in many markets , notably including that for equities , a partial reversal has occurred .
 indeed , the committee could well be concerned that further monetary easing would add fuel to the rebound in stock valuations , which arguably has already gone beyond fundamentals .
 changes to date in private financing rates may not have imposed strong restraint on planned investment spending and , although the increased cost of raising funds in private securities markets has shifted borrowing toward commercial banks , the growth of aggregate debt in nonfederal sectors appears to have been well maintained .
 with many market participants likely to be disappointed by policy inaction , yields on private securities could well back up some under alternative b . the increase in rates on treasury securities
 likely would be somewhat less , and spreads on private securities over treasuries probably would widen .
 although the initial effects of this alternative on financial markets could be somewhat negative , they would be muted and short - lived to the extent that the public believes the federal reserve is staying especially watchful of financial market strains and has not closed the door on further policy easing .
 while some risk of unusual year - end pressures can not be ruled out , chances are that any curtailment of liquidity and trading volumes across a variety of markets would prove limited and essentially temporary .
 equity prices likely would decline somewhat .
 the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets should firm , and credit spreads for emerging market securities might rise .
 m2 and m3 are predicted to continue to grow rapidly through the end of the year , reflecting strong demands for liquidity in the aftermath of the volatile market climate , as well as in response to the recent policy easings and the expectation in markets of more to come , which have reduced the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.3 over 1998 as a whole , m2 and m3 are projected to expand 9 and 10 - 3/4 percent , respectively , far overshooting their annual ranges .
 in early 1999 , however , m2 growth is projected to slow considerably as unusual demands for liquid assets abate and households redeploy liquid assets previously parked in money market mutual funds awaiting longer - term investment opportunities .
 m2 growth , however , is expected to exceed that of nominal gdp .
 m3 is forecast to outpace m2 as banks seek funding through instruments included in the broader aggregate to finance bank credit 3 the projections of money growth under alternative b assume , consistent with the greenbook forecast , that the stance of policy is left unchanged at the november meeting and eased 25 basis points at the december meeting .
 expansion and as institution - only money market funds remain attractive investments for corporate cash managers .
 under alternative b , m2 and m3 are projected to expand over the october - to - march period at annual rates of 8 and 9 - 1/2 percent , respectively , leaving both aggregates by march well above the ranges established provisionally for 1999 .

63,1998-12-22," the case for easing further at some point , as in the 1/4 point reduction in the federal funds rate at this meeting of alternative a , might rest on the view that there are substantial risks of a shortfall in global demand and of more downward pressure on prices than the committee might find desirable .
 the prospects for brazil remain fragile , and the lack of progress in resolving fiscal imbalances in that country may now suggest even higher odds for problems there that would spread to other emerging markets , feeding back to the united states .
 furthermore , the continuing steep declines in oil and commodity prices may be signalling that worldwide demand is weaker than expected .
 such price declines could themselves feed through to further reductions in aggregate price measures and inflation expectations , elevating the real federal funds rate , should the nominal funds rate remain unchanged , and putting upward pressure on real long - term rates .
 higher long - term rates could come at an inopportune time given a possibly developing overhang in manufacturing capacity .
 preemptive action to head off undue restraint on spending might be viewed as especially appropriate if inflation already were expected to be consistent with price stability .
 indeed , market participants implicitly appear to be putting some weight on these demand and price risks in that they continue to factor into market quotes another policy ease by mid - year .",-0.25," if the committee views the greenbook forecast as acceptable and the most likely outcome , it presumably would maintain the intended federal funds rate at 4 - 3/4 percent , as under alternative b . the announcement just after the last committee meeting indicated that the cumulative easing since september had appropriately positioned policy to promote sustained growth and low inflation .
 the incoming data might be read , on balance , as providing no compelling reason to change that view .
 although measures of activity have been on the strong side , inflation has remained damped .
 slower wage growth , along with declining commodity prices , suggests that price pressures and inflation expectations should be contained for some time , even in the face of what appear to be very tight labor markets .
 moreover , the points of vulnerability to the outlook seem about as they were at the time of the last policy ease .
 foreign economies are expected to strengthen on balance next year , but a significantly worse outcome can not be ruled out .
 strains in u.s .
 financial markets , for the most part , do not differ materially from mid - november , with credit spreads remaining elevated and markets still comparatively unsettled . as a consequence of the mix of incoming information and the wording of the november announcement , market participants do not expect a policy move in either direction at this meeting , and , absent an especially compelling case for policy action , the committee may wish to avoid surprising them - particularly before year - end when thin markets and a reluctance to put capital at risk could magnify the effects of any policy action .
 against this backdrop , the choice of alternative b should have little effect on domestic interest rates or dollar exchange rates .
 after year - end , when trading volume picks up and investors again become more willing to put weaker credits on their balance sheets , conditions in securities markets may well become more liquid , and risk spreads could well narrow .
 still , difficulties in foreign financial markets , domestic market disruptions , high volatility , and unusual patterns of asset price movements of recent months are likely to leave a lasting imprint on perceptions of risk , the appetite for it , and the resources dedicated to taking positions in financial markets .
 as a consequence , spreads in many markets should remain appreciably above their levels of last summer and liquidity somewhat reduced .
 under alternative b , conditions in credit markets could well improve after the turn of the year , but lenders should stay on the cautious side as the growth of economic activity slows and profits and incomes soften further .
 this caution is likely to keep the price of credit elevated for more marginal business borrowers , but other businesses should continue to find credit readily available .
 most households , too , are unlikely to face unusual credit stringency , although lenders will probably remain selective .
 as the growth of spending slows , business and household borrowing should decelerate over coming quarters .
 overall nonfinancial debt should slow to a 5 - 1/4 percent annual rate from november to march , around the center of its 3 to 7 percent provisional range for 1999 .
 under alternative b , m2 and m3 are likely to decelerate substantially .
 the growth of m2 in the first quarter will probably continue to exceed that of nominal income , in part reflecting the lingering effects of the decline in market interest rates in the latter part of 1998 . as a result , velocity will decline , but by only about 3 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate , approximately one - half of the pace that appears to have occurred in the current quarter .
 the slowing in the decline in velocity owes in part to a tapering off of the enhanced demands for liquidity that accompanied the financial turmoil .
 m3 is projected to grow faster than m2 as bank credit should continue to expand rapidly , financed in part with wholesale instruments , and as inflows of institution - only money funds are expected to stay brisk .
 under alternative b , m2 and m3 are projected to expand over the november - to - march period at annual rates of 7 - 1/2 and 9 percent , respectively .
 under all of the alternatives , m2 and m3 by march would be well above their provisional ranges .
 directive language",0," the choice of the quarter - point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c would seem to rest on the judgment that the inflation outcome in the staff forecast is unacceptable or that there are significant risks of a more substantial pickup in inflation .
 in the staff forecast , core cpi inflation persists above 2 percent , and many other measures of inflation notch higher .
 the committee may believe that a worse inflationary scenario is plausible because the economy continues to operate beyond its long - run potential , incoming data show that aggregate demand has considerable momentum , and financial conditions in general may now be too accommodative .
 the resilience of equity prices in the face of continued earnings disappointments could suggest the possibility that the stock market will remain a positive influence on demand , in contrast to the drag anticipated in the staff forecast .
 although spreads remain wide in the bond market , the absolute cost of credit , averaging across quality classes , is little changed from early summer , when the committee was concerned about inflation pressures .
 moreover , the cost of funds is down substantially for borrowers from banks as well as in the commercial paper market owing to the monetary policy easings .
 and after the turn of the year , markets might become even more attractive to private borrowers .
 in addition , the foreign exchange value of the dollar against the major currencies has fallen 6 percent since mid - july .
 finally , the surprise easing of monetary policy in continental europe may indicate an increased willingness there to respond to signs of demand weakness , which would facilitate easing in other countries and reduce the risk of a slackening in global economic activity .",0.25,,,0.0
64,1999-03-30,,N," despite the likelihood that overall inflation will rise , the committee might choose the unchanged policy stance of alternative b at this meeting .
 a good part of that rise will owe to the recent increase in oil prices ; most measures of wage and price inflation have ticked lower of 2 .
 the central tendency of the committee members ' forecasts compiled for the last meeting was for real gdp growth to be a touch slower over 1999 and the unemployment rate to end the year a bit higher than in the current greenbook .
 the committee members ' central tendency for total cpi inflation was about in line with the greenbook .
 late , which should help to contain inflation expectations ; and the projected rebound in core inflation is gradual .
 these considerations suggest that deferring action in the near term would not unduly worsen underlying inflation trends .
 the committee might see important benefits from that delay if it thought that only a modest policy adjustment was necessary and wanted to use the time to build a case for such action with the public , thereby fostering a more measured reaction in financial markets than would ensue with unanticipated action .
 inaction would be particularly attractive to the committee
 if it suspected that the price outlook in the greenbook was more likely to be subject to further favorable surprises than to adverse ones , implying that firmer evidence of an impending acceleration in prices would be desirable before tightening policy .
 indeed , the committee may be of the opinion that the staff has built in too large an uptick to inflation , perhaps by placing too little emphasis on the disinflationary force of ample industrial capacity and the market discipline now exerted on the ability of firms to pass along price increases , or by giving too much credence to the power of oil producers to enforce their recent curbs on supply .
 continuing the current stance of policy , as envisioned in alternative b , would match the expectations currently embodied in financial market prices . as a result , the immediate market reaction to no adjustment in the federal funds rate should be little movement in other interest rates or in the exchange value of the dollar .
 over time , if output were to decelerate and underlying inflation to remain contained , as in the staff forecast , long - term interest rates should fluctuate around their current levels , although , as congress and the administration address budget issues , markets might become more sensitive to developments regarding the burgeoning federal budget surplus .
 with the economic environment remaining benign and concerns about near - term monetary policy tightening mostly quiescent , major equity price indexes are likely to be little changed on net , despite pressure on corporate profit margins .",0," if the committee were concerned that inflation was likely to be on an upward path , as in the staff forecast , it might favor the 1/4 percentage point tightening in the intended federal funds rate of alternative c . with aggregate demand remaining strong , credit conditions improving further , and many emerging market economies showing signs of stabilizing , the committee might believe that the current meeting is an appropriate time to roll back the policy easing of last november , initiating the policy action needed to contain inflation over time .
 many on the committee had viewed the last easing action as an insurance policy taken out as a precaution against further financial turmoil and a significant broadening of the crises in emerging markets .
 while this action may have helped to forestall these eventualities , in current circumstances they would be unlikely to surface if that action were reversed .
 the desirability of immediate tightening would be enhanced to the extent that the committee read recent data on spending as indicating that the growth of aggregate demand would not slow as in the staff projection but rather would remain unsustainably strong absent a tightening of financial conditions .
 with the unemployment rate already low and perhaps headed lower , real interest rates would seem to be falling short of levels required to contain inflationary pressures .
 moreover , while domestic price increases in the past few years have run at a much slower pace than might have been expected in light of labor market conditions , recently some of the forces that may have been responsible for this result -- declines in oil prices and inflation expectations-- show signs of reversing .
 while financial market participants apparently believe that the committee 's next move will be toward restraint , no measurable weight is placed on action at this meeting .
 as a result , the 25 basis point hike in the intended federal funds rate of alternative c could spark a substantial reaction in financial markets .
 short - term interest rates would rise at least as much as the policy rate , the prices of long - term debt instruments and equities could come under considerable downward pressure , and the value of the dollar would probably rise sharply on foreign exchange markets .
 if the committee viewed inflation risks to be substantial , such a market reaction might be desired as it would speed up the necessary adjustment of aggregate demand .
 but if a more modest realignment of market prices were sought , the committee could attempt to shape market expectations through the wording of the announcement .
 in particular , stressing that some of last fall 's easing was no longer needed might limit the tendency of market participants to extrapolate policy tightening into the future .",0.25,,,0.0
65,1999-05-18,,N," the response of financial markets to the continuation of an unchanged policy stance , as under alternative b , would depend importantly on whether the committee announces a change in the tilt of the directive .
 especially after the publication today of a surprisingly large rise in the cpi in april , market participants reportedly see a good chance that the committee will announce a directive tilted toward tightening .
 against that backdrop , debt and equity markets could rally some if there were no announcement regarding the symmetry of the directive ; market participants would conclude that the committee chose a symmetric directive and probably would see a reduced likelihood of future action .
 over time , longer - term yields would fluctuate near these lower levels as incoming output and price data in line with the greenbook forecast suggest a slowing economy and damped inflation but still the possibility of eventual tightening .
 under these conditions , the average value of the dollar should not move far from its recent range .
 if , on the other hand , the committee decided to adopt and announce a tilt in its directive toward tightening , market participants probably would place slightly higher odds on a policy tightening sometime over the next few meetings , pushing up interest and exchange rates modestly further .
 also , with the committee seen as more inclined to act , markets could well become more sensitive to information bearing on the price outlook .
 abstracting from the estimated effects of refunds and nonwithheld tax payments in recent months , m2 growth has slowed considerably , even relative to the projected deceleration in nominal spending for the second quarter .
 some of the fall - off in m2 growth has likely been temporary , reflecting the recovery of financial markets and the unwinding of the general buildup of liquidity that occurred in the last several months of 1998 .
 after softening substantially in may owing to the clearing of tax checks , m2 growth is projected to pick up in the months ahead under alternative b , extending the trend decline in velocity evident since mid-1997 , and leaving growth of this aggregate for the year at about 6 percent , somewhat above its annual range of 1 to 5 percent .
 the recent sluggish behavior of bank credit also appears to reflect an unwinding of the developments of last fall ; as bank credit growth steps up in the months ahead , banks should again need to turn to managed liabilities for financing , and m3 growth should rebound as well .
 for 1999 as a whole , m3 is projected to post a 6 - 1/2 percent growth rate , placing it a little above its annual range of 2 to 6 percent .
 directive language",0," if the committee saw a pickup in underlying inflation as likely , it might favor the 25 basis point firming of alternative c . even with what would seem to be a generous allowance for expected productivity growth and with relatively restrained pressures on nominal and real wages at projected labor resource utilization rates , the staff still foresees a gradual uptrend in core inflation .
 the forecast implies that financial conditions must tighten appreciably to contain inflation .
 moreover , the april cpi may be a sign that the tendency for higher inflation is stronger than contemplated in the greenbook forecast .
 although most bond yields have backed up since late last fall , in other respects financial market conditions have eased since the committee 's last reduction in the federal funds rate , and economic activity both here and abroad has proven more buoyant than anticipated .
 the renewed appetite for risk in financial markets and apparently relentless upward march of the stock market in recent months may suggest the possibility that financial conditions will be more accommodative than in the staff outlook .
 in this context , the committee may believe that tightening policy now would be prudent in light of the significant risk that substantial economic imbalances would build if the committee postponed action until higher inflation became more evident in the data .
 financial market prices embody little expectation of a policy firming at this meeting .
 as a consequence , the immediate 25 basis point increase in the funds rate of alternative c would trigger a similar rise in short - term interest rates .
 the extent of the response of other u.s .
 financial markets would depend on the outlook for further policy firming , which would be importantly affected by the wording of the announcement .
 term rates should go up significantly less than short rates , as some later rise in short - term nominal rates already has been built into market prices , and investors might be more confident of the outlook for subdued inflation with such a preemptive move by the federal reserve .
 however , if market participants were to decide that several additional tightening moves were likely , long rates would increase more substantially , as they often have in the past when policy has turned in a firming direction .
 some adverse reaction would be expected in foreign financial markets , but absent a steep sell - off in domestic markets , the fallout should be limited , given the recovery in overseas markets and their modest response to the recent increases in u.s . interest rates .",0.25,,,0.0
66,1999-08-24,,N," despite the pickup in underlying inflation in the staff forecast , the committee may nonetheless prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting , as under alternative b . the projected pickup in inflation , if realized , would be gradual and not likely for some time to foster an appreciable increase in inflation expectations that could destabilize financial markets or materially increase the ultimate cost to economic activity of containing price pressures .
 accordingly , policy makers would be afforded more time to judge whether the rise in inflation in fact is likely to materialize .
 such additional time might be viewed as especially desirable if the committee were to put less weight than the staff on the possibility that underlying inflation trends are adverse .
 recent data may suggest that spending is on a lower trajectory than in the staff forecast -- particularly because domestic demand likely has not yet felt much of the effects of the run - up in interest rates and financial markets would be rolled back should the committee fail to validate prevailing expectations of policy tightening , financial conditions on net could well remain more restrictive than those that generally have prevailed this year .
 and the committee may see the wage and cost data as sufficiently ambiguous to reserve judgment on whether the current level of tautness in labor markets will produce accelerating prices , especially since trends in core consumer inflation and longer - run inflation expectations remain flat .
 moreover , recent developments may indicate that global financial markets are fragile , with the potential for further deterioration as year - end approaches even absent a firming in policy .
 news that the committee was standing pat , as under alternative b , would come as a considerable surprise in the market , triggering a rally in capital markets and putting further downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 that reaction would be tempered if the committee chose and announced a directive tilted toward restraint , thus preserving expectations of a higher funds rate in the near term .
 this approach might be favored if the committee believed tightening was probably needed fairly promptly but wanted to be more assured that an acceleration of costs and prices was in train .
 in these circumstances , however , financial markets could remain volatile as market participants awaited policy action , with possible adverse effects on spreads .
 if , instead , the committee thought that the sense in financial markets that policy tightening is almost inevitable were inconsistent with its own assessment of the situation , this market misconception could be countered by announcing that a neutral bias was being retained , though the announcement would need to convey a more balanced sense of risks than the market now sees as implied by the "" asymmetrical symmetry "" of the june directive and related announcement .
 the expected path of short - term rates would be revised down , but a traditional symmetry might elevate market participants ' uncertainty about the federal reserve 's assessment of inflation risks and policy intentions in light of the inflationary concerns expressed in the chairman 's testimony .",0," the staff forecast suggests that there are substantial risks that price pressures will be intensifying and by enough to require an appreciable tightening of policy ultimately to stabilize inflation .
 if the committee shares these concerns , it might see little to be gained from delaying policy action and choose the 1/4 percentage point firming of alternative c as an appropriate down payment .
 even a sense that inflation risks were less pronounced than in the staff forecast might lead the committee to the view that a modest near - term policy firming was warranted .
 as noted , failing to validate current market expectations of policy action would tend to erode prevailing financial restraint , which may be seen as risking unsustainable economic growth and greater strains in already - tight labor markets , thus heightening the odds of accelerating prices .
 given apparently mounting worries about the secular imbalance in the u.s . trade position , the committee especially might want to avoid fostering doubts among global investors about the federal reserve 's commitment to contain inflation .
 elevated market stresses apparently owe importantly both to uncertainty surrounding the outlook for system action and some aversion on the part of traders and investors to participate in the market in the fourth quarter .
 the former could be alleviated by immediate action combined with an announcement suggesting little likelihood of subsequent policy moves , while the latter might suggest that -- because the committee may feel increasingly uncomfortable in tightening as the year wears on -- action delayed now may wind up being delayed for some time to come .
 given the high odds market participants put on action at this meeting , the announcement that the committee was raising the intended federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point , as under alternative c , should produce little response in key financial prices if no surprises are in store from the wording of the press release .
 the market consensus has settled on a quarter - point move and the retention of a symmetric directive .
 if the announcement of such a directive suggested to market participants that further action was unlikely for some time , financial markets might rally to some extent , as investors removed the modest odds on additional tightening that now seem built into the structure of interest rates for the fourth quarter .
 if , instead , action on tuesday were accompanied by a directive tilted toward tightening , market participants could take it as a signal that additional firming is in the cards this year -- and more so even than is currently built into financial prices . as a result , the term structure of interest rates would likely shift up and the dollar would probably strengthen on exchange markets . because additional tightening would be taken as fairly imminent , market spreads would likely remain wide as issuers rushed to lock in longer - term financing in advance of the committee 's next action .
 indeed , if the committee thought that it likely would need to tighten again before year - end because it wanted to forestall an upward trend to inflation like that in the staff forecast , century - date- change considerations might strengthen the argument for a 50 basis point firming with a symmetric directive at this meeting instead of a 25 basis point move with an asymmetric directive .
 such a move , by restoring the federal funds rate to its level of last august and by getting ahead of market expectations , would have a very good chance of being seen as the last action for the year .
 while interest rates and the dollar 's exchange rate would rise appreciably and equity prices likely would fall , helping to damp demand more than in the staff forecast , the elements of volatility and uncertainty in the market associated with possible near - term policy action would be greatly diminished .
 after the initial adjustment , market conditions should settle down , providing a better environment for financial market participants to plan their balance sheet management over the year - end .
-- the firming in policy under alternative c occurs late enough this year to impart only slight restraint on the aggregates in 1999 .",0.25,,,0.25
67,1999-10-05,,N," an unchanged intended federal funds rate , as under alternative b , along with retention of a symmetric directive , would foster the sense that the committee probably will not act over the remainder of this year , especially given y2k - related uncertainties.5 with market prices now incorporating some odds on a tightening in the fourth quarter , this 5 under the committee 's current disclosure policy , the combination of no policy action and the retention of a symmetric directive would not be accompanied by an explicit announcement .
 even so , the markets would immediately infer from the absence of an announcement that the committee had adopted a directive that called for no change in policy and no tilt looking forward .
 committee decision could spark a modest rally in financial markets .
 the choice of alternative b with a tilt toward tightening , which would be announced immediately , would tend to increase the perceived chances of a near - term firming , causing interest rates to back up slightly and markets to become more sensitive to incoming data and to statements by policymakers .
 in any event , banks and other lenders are likely to remain cautious suppliers of funds to private borrowers as the year - end approaches , especially short - term credit whose repayment could be viewed as potentially impaired for a little while by disruptions in markets or the particular problems of individual counterparties .
 year - end premiums in money markets typically jump early in the fourth quarter , but in some years they have declined subsequently as borrowers satisfied their needs .
 spread movements , of course , are subject to greater uncertainty with the century date change .
 this year borrowers seem to be securing financing somewhat earlier than the norm , which may help to relieve some pressures , though not by enough to prevent spreads from remaining quite elevated .",0," the committee instead could favor a 1/4 percentage point firming in the intended federal funds rate to 5 - 1/2 percent , as in alternative c .
 a rationale for this policy tightening would be that the inflation uptrend embodied in the staff forecast is both likely and unacceptable and warrants a faster and more aggressive policy response than is assumed in that forecast .
 indeed , the persistent strength of domestic final demand in the face of elevated long - term rates and flat stock prices since the spring , the currently low inventory- sales ratios , and the strengthening of activity abroad might be seen as pointing to risks that are skewed toward an unemployment rate appreciably below 4 percent in the near future and a greater intensification of inflation pressures .
 although the markets are not fully prepared for such an action and an outsized price reaction can not be ruled out , the committee might be willing to accept even a sharp reduction in bond and stock prices as an aspect of the process of containing inflation .
 the committee might see action at this meeting as especially desirable if it views potential financial disruptions as increasingly militating against tightening policy between now and early next year and if it also sees that interval as a period of time when firmer policy is going to be needed to prevent inflation pressures from cumulating .",0.25,,,0.0
68,1999-11-16,,N," even if the committee , like the staff , sees forces at work tending to raise core inflation over time , it may be sufficiently uncertain about that outcome that it still would wish to leave the intended funds rate unchanged at this meeting at 5 - 1/4 percent , as under alternative b , and to retain the tilt toward firming to convey a sense of the risks .
 most incoming data on prices and labor costs , including gdp prices , the eci , average hourly earnings , and unit labor costs , have once again proven to be surprisingly benign despite increasingly taut labor markets .
 this string of favorable readings underscores questions about the reliability of the traditional relationships that lie behind predictions that inflation will pick up should resource utilization remain around its current level .
 indeed , the revised output data could be read as leaving open the possibility that productivity is continuing to accelerate , perhaps substantially .
 while the associated increase in the marginal return on capital projects would require higher real short - term interest rates at some point , the economy could be able to produce beyond its long - run potential for a while longer without an intensification of inflation so long as gains in real wages do not outstrip rising labor productivity .
 in this circumstance , further policy tightening would be unnecessary for some time .
 in light of the possibility that supply - side relationships continue to be unusually favorable , the committee might see considerable benefit from waiting for more solid evidence that an inflationary upswing was in train .
 even if productivity gains do not materialize , the possible cost of delaying a firming in policy until early next year may not be considered especially large since longer - term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored .
 under alternative b , the staff expects that m2 will grow 6 percent this year and m3 7 - 1/4 percent , compared with the 5 and 6 percent upper bounds of their respective annual ranges .
 built into these projections is a pickup in growth over the last two months of the year to a 8 - 1/4 percent pace for m2 and an 11 - 1/4 percent pace for m3 .
 the staff estimates that approximately 2 and 3 percentage points of these respective growth rates will be attributable to the impact of y2k concerns in temporarily boosting demands for monetary assets that are regarded as safe and liquid .
 these effects are reversed by the end of february . smoothing through y2k effects , the staff forecasts m2 and m3 to expand from october to march at rates of 6 - 1/2 and 7 - 1/4 percent , respectively .
 directive language",0," the committee instead may favor a 25 basis point increase in its intended federal funds rate , as under alternative c . although the staff has adopted the view that structural productivity is growing along a higher and steeper trajectory over the forecast period than previously thought , it still predicts an increase in core inflation over the next two years that the committee may find both likely and unacceptable .
 the committee may view the current tautness in labor markets as pointing so strongly toward a pickup in inflation that the need to firm policy would be unlikely to be called into question by new information arriving over the next few months .
 even if the committee questioned whether current labor market conditions were so problematic , it may still see a substantial risk that resource utilization is in the process of tightening further , which in turn would induce rising inflation .
 the growth of aggregate demand has continued to outstrip that of aggregate supply , and only limited data are in hand to indicate that demand will be slowing enough to bring the two into balance .
 indeed , one risk to that balancing is that policy inaction would provide additional fuel to investor optimism , pushing equity prices higher and providing a spur to spending .
 another risk may emanate from the external sector : recent news on foreign economies has been upbeat and has contributed to better conditions in their capital markets , which may provide more impetus to spending than projected by the staff .
 the inflationary impulse from the external sector would be intensified if improving foreign growth prospects and mounting u.s .
 net foreign indebtedness were to diminish the appetite of global investors for dollar assets , placing substantial downward pressure on the dollar , which would directly feed through to prices as well as demand for u.s . output .
 to offset these external forces , firmer financial conditions in the united states would be necessary to damp domestic demand so as to prevent an intensification of pressures on resources .
 the choice of the 1/4 percentage point rise in the funds rate under alternative c may incline the committee to return to a symmetric directive .
 an unbiased directive could convey a sense that policy makers thought they might have put sufficient cumulative restraint in place to check inflation or , at least , to buy some time to assess whether additional firming was needed .
 alternatively , the committee may decide to retain an asymmetric directive in order to transmit its impression that , despite the higher 5 - 1/2 percent funds rate , the risks over a longer time period would still be tilted in the direction of heightened inflation pressures .
 if the committee wanted to be sure that market uncertainties about near - term policy action did not unduly contribute to strains in the runup to year end , the announcement could convey a disinclination to act in december .
 while financial markets are somewhat illiquid , confidence about y2k preparedness and procedures to contain systemic problems has been growing , suggesting that the 1/4 percentage point firming at this meeting under alternative c -- although a bit of a surprise -- would be unlikely to create undue strains .
 the response of key financial prices would depend importantly on the type of tilt and the wording of the announcement .
 an asymmetric directive and words emphasizing continuing inflation risks over a longer time period would impart to market participants the impression that further tightening moves could well be in store beginning fairly early next year .
 in that case , an appreciable backup in bond yields , sell - off of stocks , and strengthening of the exchange value of the dollar could be anticipated .
 in contrast , a symmetric directive and an announcement suggesting that the committee could well stay its hand for some time could lead market participants to mark down their expectations for cumulative monetary policy tightening and reduce their uncertainty about near - term actions .
 in such a case , bond and stock prices could dip only slightly .",0.25,,,0.25
69,1999-12-21,,N," given the circumstances of the looming century date change , the economic outlook might not weigh as significantly in the committee 's consideration of its action at this meeting as is usual .
 the committee might see the heightened potential for financial dislocation at this time as sufficient reason to keep policy on hold at this meeting , choosing alternative b . although financial markets have been much more liquid in recent weeks than many participants had anticipated earlier in the year , various indicators still suggest that trading is likely to be thin and investors unusually risk averse around year - end .
 market participants have apparently interpreted federal reserve actions to deal with potential liquidity problems around the century date change , along with the adoption of a symmetric directive at the last meeting , as virtually ensuring that the intended federal funds rate would be left unchanged this month .
 with this prevailing expectation , a monetary tightening would prompt substantial adjustments in portfolios .
 the extent of the resulting drop in market prices could well be exacerbated by the thinness of markets and by the urgency that market participants are likely to feel to complete their adjustments quickly before market liquidity erodes further .
 under the circumstances , the committee may not want to incur even the small risk of a potentially costly market disruption that might follow a policy tightening , especially when any increase in inflation pressures resulting from a short delay would be quite limited .
 overall consumer price inflation is expected to moderate a little , which should help damp inflation expectations , and most of the restraining effects of a near - term policy firming are already built into financial market prices .
 assuming the selection of alternative b and no significantly untoward developments over year - end , some further abatement of the unusual risk aversion and demand for liquidity currently evident in markets should be apparent over the first few weeks of 2000 .
 risks spreads could narrow somewhat , but they should remain wider , and other credit terms tighter , than in the period before the market disruptions in the summer and fall of 1998 .
 measured from october to march , domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to expand at a 5 - 1/2 percent pace , roughly in line with nominal income , placing this aggregate in march in the upper half of its 3 to 7 percent provisional range .
 after its y2k - related runup late in the year , expansion of the monetary aggregates is expected to moderate substantially over the first few months of the new year .
 currency growth should slow sharply .
 similarly , the recent surge in large time deposits should substantially unwind , as bank credit growth settles down from its y2k - related bulge and depository institutions return to more typical funding patterns .
 m2 also should continue to respond to the earlier tightenings in the stance of monetary policy and the associated widening in the opportunity cost of holding retail monetary assets .
 from december to march , m2 and m3 are projected to grow at 4 and 3 - 3/4 percent annual rates , respectively under alternative b . measured over the october - to - march period to abstract from most y2k influences , m2 is forecast to expand at a 5 - 1/2 percent rate under that alternative .
 this growth would leave this aggregate in march at the upper end of its provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range .
 m3 is projected to expand at an 8 - 1/2 percent pace over the same period , placing it in march somewhat above its provisional 2 to 6 percent annual range .
 directive language",0,,0.25,,,0.0
70,2000-03-21,,N," the committee may agree that the risks to the inflation outlook are on the upside , but still wish to stand pat on policy for the time being , as in alternative b . such a choice could allow it to better judge whether more near - term tightening is needed or whether the restraining effects on aggregate demand of previous tightening actions will prove to be sufficient to bring growth in aggregate demand into reasonable balance with that of potential supply .
 indeed , the amount of slowing required in the growth of output may not be large if more of the extraordinary growth of productivity over the last few quarters persists than has been allowed for in the staff forecast -- the very rapid growth of activity since mid - year produced only small declines in the unemployment rate and in the pool of available labor .
 even if the growth of aggregate demand fails to come into balance with that of potential supply quickly enough to avoid some intensification of strains on resources , the costs of waiting in terms of faster price increases still might be minimal if structural productivity continues to accelerate over the next couple of years .
 the acceleration of structural productivity would hold down unit labor costs and , with profits running high , competition would continue to contain business "" pricing power .
 thus , inflation would remain damped for some time even with a constant nominal federal funds rate , although , to be sure , a higher real funds rate would ultimately be required to align market interest rates with improved returns on capital investments and greater wealth - induced consumption .
 in effect , the committee would be allowing the economy to realize the gains from the extra productivity growth mainly in temporarily higher output rather than lower inflation .
 the monetary aggregates are projected to accelerate a little from their growth rates early this year , when they were depressed by the unwinding of y2k effects .
 nonetheless , expansion of the aggregates , particularly m2 , should be restrained by the influence of earlier policy tightenings , even under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b . growth rates of m2 in coming months are likely to be erratic , owing to the effects of the shifting timing of tax refunds and the likely surge in payments , but on average this aggregate is projected to expand at a rate of 6 - 1/4 percent over the february - to - june period under alternative b . with nominal gdp expanding faster than m2 , m2 velocity would increase at a 1 - 3/4 percent pace in both the first and the second quarters .
 by june , m2 would be 5 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate above its fourth - quarter 1999 base , somewhat above the upper end of its annual range .
 buoyed by rapid bank credit growth , expansion of m3 is projected at an 8 percent rate over the february - to - june period , keeping this aggregate well above the upper end of its annual range .
 indeed , by june , m3 would be 8 percent at an annual rate above its fourth - quarter base , compared with the 6 percent upper end of its range .",0," any unwinding of the current degree of restraint in financial markets , which incorporates 25 basis points of tightening at this meeting , might be viewed by the committee as exacerbating the risk of economic overheating .
 with little evidence in hand that spending is moderating appreciably , aggregate demand still seems to be expanding more rapidly than even optimistic estimates of the growth of potential aggregate supply .
 in these circumstances , the committee 's assessment of the inflation risks may be such that it favors an immediate tightening of policy , perhaps by raising the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point as in alternative c .
 the committee might believe it especially important to provide continuing evidence of its vigilance as the effect on inflation of the recent surge in oil prices plays out in coming months .
 even if the committee anticipates that considerably more policy firming will be needed eventually to contain inflation pressures , it may still favor the gradual approach embodied in alternative c in light of the considerable uncertainty about aggregate supply and about the effect of the substantial run - up in short- and long - term interest rates in recent quarters on aggregate demand .
 such gradualism also may hold appeal because financial markets have been edgy and are potentially vulnerable to an unexpectedly large policy move .
 if the committee were to choose alternative c , it presumably would also want to convey to market participants that the balance of risks remains tilted toward inflation .
 such a combination , because it is widely expected , would tend to have little effect on fixed- income yields and the exchange value of the dollar . very broad measures of equity prices over the intermeeting period would be expected to fluctuate near recent levels .
 preannouncements and announcements of corporate earnings will pick up steam in the weeks ahead , likely keeping volatility in equity markets elevated , which could possibly feed back on interest rates in a manner similar to recent experience .",0.25," the committee may believe that financial markets have underestimated the full extent of the policy firming required to keep inflation from picking up .
 such an action , particularly if accompanied by an announcement conveying the committee 's view that the balance of risks remains tilted toward inflation , would prompt a substantial realignment of financial prices that might be seen by the committee as more likely to be consistent with a sustainable trajectory of economic activity .
 market participants probably would expect more cumulative policy firming , boosting interest rates across the maturity spectrum , especially at the front end of the yield curve .
 such prospects for tighter monetary policy and greater restraint on spending should raise credit risk premiums on corporate bonds and weaken equity prices .
 the argument for a substantial tightening in financial conditions would have particular force if the committee , like the staff , viewed labor utilization rates as too high to be sustained .
 indeed , in the staff forecast , the assumption of even more tightening than currently evident in futures rates is still inadequate to keep core inflation from trending higher .
 moreover , a steeper path for the real funds rate might be seen as necessary to counter a risk of a ratcheting up of longer - term inflation expectations owing to the recent surge in oil prices .
 even if the committee only wanted to ensure that it was preserving the upward path for the real federal funds rate that a number of committee members seemed to have been contemplating in february , the possible effects of the further jump in oil prices on short- term inflation expectations suggest that something more than a 1/4 percentage point rise in the nominal rate might be needed .",0.5,0.25
71,2000-05-16,,N,,N," even if the committee 's assessment of the outlook is such that a substantial firming of policy ultimately will be necessary to prevent underlying inflation from rising , it still may favor a continued gradual approach , as under alternative c . signs of an actual acceleration in prices are quite recent , and the committee may require further evidence that inflation is on the upswing before firming policy more aggressively .
 while some measures of labor compensation gains recently have shown signs of strengthening , this development may be largely a lagged response to previous increases in productivity growth rather than a signal of heightened inflation pressures .
 moreover , the elevated uncertainty about the economy 's sustainable level of resource utilization and rate of output growth -- which contributes to the sense that forecasts of inflation are less reliable -- might justify continuing the incremental approach to policy firming .
 continued gradualism would afford the federal reserve more time to assess the responsiveness of the economy and inflation to the cumulative change in the stance of monetary policy , thereby limiting the risk of possible over - tightening .
 and , to the extent that market participants extrapolate the gradual approach to policy tightening into the future , expectations of further policy restraint will remain embedded in the structure of market interest rates , still bringing forward in time the effects on spending of future policy firming .
 the 25 basis point move of alternative c would be somewhat smaller than is incorporated in financial market prices .
 even if the committee also announces that the balance of risks remains skewed toward higher inflation , short rates still would decline , as market participants marked down their expected near - term path for the funds rate target .
 longer - term yields also might edge down if market participants concluded that the federal reserve would be pursuing a more gradual approach than they had anticipated , and this strategy was not viewed as enhancing inflation risks .
 on the latter score , market participants might infer from the small size of the policy move that inflationary pressures are a little less intense than they had thought ; such a response would , of course , be more plausible if the cpi data to be released the morning of the meeting turn out to be benign .
 equity prices could rally , while the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets might change little .
 but it can not be ruled out that financial market participants would adopt a more skeptical interpretation of limited federal reserve action .
 if a sense that the committee had fallen behind the curve of requisite policy firming became prevalent , which would be made more likely by a disquieting cpi release , longer - term rates could back up , equity prices weaken , and the dollar come under downward pressure .",0.25," the reaction of asset prices to the adoption of alternative d would probably depend on the committee 's decision about the balance of risks .
 if the policy move were accompanied by a statement that the balance of risks remains tilted toward higher inflation , short - term rates would likely increase slightly as market participants revise up a bit their expectations for the path of the funds rate .
 these elevated expectations would tend to boost the yields on longer - term private instruments a little as well , and equity prices might weaken some .
 the increase in rates on treasury securities , however , could be more limited if demands for safety and liquidity were to increase in an environment of more aggressive policy tightening .
 if alternative d instead were accompanied by a statement that the risks were now seen as balanced , the market reaction would be more difficult to predict .
 on average , investors appear currently to expect another 100 basis points or so of monetary policy tightening over the next twelve months , rather than just the 50 basis points at this meeting embodied in alternative
 most would infer from such a balance - of - risks statement that monetary policy would be on hold for a while .
 some investors might conclude that inflation pressures were not as strong as they had previously thought and that the peak in short - term rates could well have been reached , while others might be concerned that the federal reserve had misgauged the situation and eventually was likely to need to firm policy much further , particularly given the possibility that subsequent policy adjustment would be too slow in the near term .
 on net , longer - term interest rates probably would increase a bit less , initially , than if the committee indicated that the balance of risks was skewed toward higher inflation . if developments over the following weeks were to unfold along the lines of the staff forecast , most market participants likely would conclude that additional policy firming was needed .
 longer - term yields would then tend to rise further , reflecting increases both in real rates and in inflation expectations .",0.5,0.5
72,2000-08-22,,N," recent data on spending , productivity , and labor costs could well be seen by the committee as on balance supporting a decision to leave the federal funds rate target unchanged at 6 - 1/2 percent , as in alternative b . signs of an appreciable moderation in aggregate demand growth no longer seem to be just "" tentative and preliminary , "" and unit labor costs point toward little near - term pressure on inflation .
 indeed , the growth of aggregate demand may have already slowed enough to keep the unemployment rate from falling , even before the effects on the economy of previous policy firmings and the flattening in equity prices have fully played out .
 the conviction that aggregate demand is now growing in line with the expansion of potential output would be strengthened if the committee found plausible the staff 's upward revision to the rate of increase in productivity .
 however , even if the current level of resource utilization holds for a time , whether that level will ultimately prove sustainable remains an open question .
 in the meantime , with costs contained and long - term inflation expectations stable or even drifting a bit lower , the committee might expect to incur little economic cost by awaiting more information to help answer that question .
 although the odds that pressures on resources will not intensify may seem better balanced now than they did eight weeks ago , the committee may still see the risks as tilted toward an unacceptable inflation outcome , given the persisting strength in elements of aggregate demand , the low unemployment rate , and the somewhat elevated current rate of core inflation .
 the choice of alternative b , accompanied by a sentence conveying a balance of risks weighted in an inflationary direction , would accord with the expectations of market participants .
 no significant immediate response would be forthcoming in financial markets .
 under the staff forecast , economic data over the intermeeting period are likely to continue to indicate moderate demand growth and contained inflation and thus should have little net effect on market prices .",0," the 25 basis point increase in the targeted funds rate of alternative c would seem appropriate if the inflation forecasted by the staff were seen as likely and unacceptable .
 it might be viewed as unacceptable in part because the already prevailing core cpi inflation rate of 2 - 1/2 percent in the greenbook may be judged to be inconsistent with the federal reserve 's longer - run objective of effective price stability .
 even if the committee were willing to tolerate such a rate of price increase for a while , inflation is headed higher in the staff forecast in that the economy already has overshot the levels of output and employment that are sustainable in the longer run .
 in such circumstances , delaying needed policy firming could allow inflationary pressures to build , eventually requiring a more disruptive policy tightening and economic slowdown to achieve the same long - run inflation outcome .
 aside from the current level of resource utilization , the committee may see significant upside risks to inflation .
 oil prices have remained stubbornly high , and the decline projected by the staff may not materialize , eliminating a source of prospective price restraint and perhaps inducing a ratcheting - up of inflation expectations .
 in addition , the restraint on aggregate demand put in place by the committee 's prior tightenings
 has been offset to some extent by the recent rally in capital markets , and prospective increases in productivity growth may boost wealth and expected earnings even more than they have already , especially if real interest rates lie below the higher marginal product of capital .
 the choice of alternative c would surprise market participants , raising questions about the path for monetary policy going forward .
 market participants might wonder whether the committee has read incoming data as more worrisome than they themselves have or whether the committee was intent on attaining a lower inflation objective than investors previously perceived .
 the resulting upward adjustment to participants ' impression of the degree of future monetary policy restraint that is likely to be implemented would be especially pronounced if the committee retained a balance - of - risks sentence emphasizing inflationary concerns .
 bond rates , particularly in real terms , could be expected to rise along with short - term yields , the dollar would probably appreciate further , and stock prices would adjust downward .
 conversely , a switch to a sentence conveying a balanced set of risks would foster a much greater sense of certainty in markets that the peak in short - term rates had been reached .
 in this case , the immediate price response in financial markets would be tempered , apart from an upward adjustment of short - term rates of around 1/4 percentage point .",0.25,,,0.0
73,2000-10-03,,N," while the committee may find the pickup in core inflation in the staff forecast to be worrisome , it may still favor keeping the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting , as under alternative b . the uptrend to core inflation in that outlook is gradual and far from certain to come to pass .
 based on incoming data , the committee might now be even more confident that aggregate demand growth has slowed significantly , likely to below the growth of potential supply .
 moreover , with the slippage in equity prices over the intermeeting period , the prospects have improved that pressures on resources will not intensify and could even begin to ebb .
 higher energy prices would pose a threat to longer- term price performance if they became embedded in inflation expectations or in wage demands , as workers attempt to preserve purchasing power .
 however , oil prices have fallen from their peaks , and , to date , longer - term inflation expectations have not shown a tendency to move higher .
 moreover , the risks stemming from oil market developments are not all in one direction .
 in particular , higher oil prices could restrain aggregate demand beyond the effects of transferring income to foreign oil producers if they induced an erosion of consumer confidence or a substantial selloff in equities in light of the reduced economic efficiency of the existing stock of capital .
 market participants , taking into account oil prices along with other incoming information since the last fomc meeting , have marked down the expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years .
 in these circumstances , the committee may see little to be lost by waiting to obtain more information on trends in output and inflation .
 market prices incorporate the expectation that the target federal funds rate and the balance - of - risks sentence will be left unchanged at this meeting .
 consequently , implementation of alternative b , along with the retention of the statement that the committee regarded the balance of risks as weighted toward increased inflationary pressures , should have little effect on financial markets .
 the committee might well see the revised outlook for oil prices , coming at a time when it was already concerned about potential price pressures from the unusually low unemployment rate , as reinforcing a judgment that the balance of risks is weighted toward higher inflation .
 however , the committee may now believe that growth of aggregate demand is not likely to exceed that of potential output , that current levels of resource utilization are sustainable , and that oil prices probably will not leave a lasting imprint on inflation .
 if so , it could consider issuing a statement that indicated balanced risks to achieving its goals for price stability and sustainable economic growth .
 in this case , bond and equity markets would likely rally , as investors marked up the odds on an easing trend in monetary policy over coming months , and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would probably edge lower .",0," the fomc instead might choose the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c . core inflation has risen and may already be above rates that committee members find acceptable over the long run .
 moreover , although underlying trends in aggregate demand apparently have slowed , the current and projected levels of resource utilization may imply , based on historical experience , a likelihood that core inflation will continue to increase , as in the staff forecast .
 furthermore , the committee may see upside risks to inflation even relative to that forecast .
 while the staff has trimmed the amount of fiscal restraint in the outlook , recent news might be read as suggesting a distinct possibility of even greater erosion in federal budget surpluses .
 in addition , if oil prices do not fall as in the staff forecast and futures market quotes , short - term inflation expectations may deteriorate further , which , absent monetary policy firming , would reduce the real federal funds rate .
 in simulations of staff econometric models , such as that shown in the international section of part i of the greenbook , holding the nominal funds rate along the baseline path in the face of an upward shock to oil prices sets in motion a process of ever- rising core inflation relative to the baseline outcome as lower real interest rates boost output relative to potential .
 the market reaction to implementation of alternative c would likely be sharp .
 with investors expecting no change in the stance of monetary policy at this meeting and apparently anticipating that the next move will be toward easing ,
 short - term interest rates would probably jump by at least the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate .
 especially if the announcement indicated that the committee continued to see the balance of risks as weighted toward higher inflation , capital markets could sell off significantly , as market participants adjusted prices to incorporate expectations of a higher path for short- term interest rates .
 any decline in inflation expectations would probably offset only part of the effect on nominal bond yields of the higher real rates brought about by the tightening .
 the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would firm against most currencies .
 an announcement of balanced risks would likely be seen by market participants as a signal that the committee believed that this phase of policy tightening had been completed .
 in this case , the response to a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting would be muted .",0.25,,,0.0
74,2000-11-15," if the committee believes that economic growth likely will remain below that of its potential at the current funds rate , along the lines of the staff forecast , but thinks that the existing level of resource use may be sustainable
 , then it might choose the 25 basis point easing of alternative a in order to forestall an unnecessary rise in the unemployment rate .
 the argument for this policy choice would be stronger if the committee put significant weight on the possibility that aggregate demand would prove weaker than in the staff forecast .
 such an eventuality could occur if softer economic performance leads to further deterioration of financial conditions and more cautious spending behavior by households and businesses .
 while money market futures embed the expectation of policy easing at some point , market participants do not anticipate such action at this meeting , in part because after its previous meeting the committee stated that it continued to view the risks as weighted toward higher inflation .
 adoption of alternative a , therefore , would trigger a rally in bond and stock markets , though the extent would depend on the accompanying statement of the balance of risks .
 if the committee announced that it believes the risks to be in balance , investors could well interpret the easing as mostly bringing forward in time policy actions they had already anticipated , attenuating price gains .
 if the committee instead announced a view that risks are weighted toward economic weakness , the rally in the treasury market would be more vigorous as investors came to expect a larger cumulative policy easing .
 the federal reserve 's evident concerns about a slowing economy and deteriorating financial conditions might lead investors to become more worried about repayment prospects , causing risk spreads to widen some .
 however , the committee 's willingness to act would likely reassure market participants that downside risks would be limited .",-0.25," aggregate demand now has slowed more convincingly to a pace below that of its potential , and , in the staff view , the unemployment rate seems more likely to rise than to fall over coming quarters .
 if the committee shares that assessment , it may see financial conditions as probably already tight enough , at least for a time , to limit any further step - up in core inflation and may select alternative b , which keeps the federal funds rate unchanged .
 indeed , if the committee views the data on unit costs and prices of the last few years as indicating that the sustainable rate of unemployment is below that in the staff forecast , it might judge the present stance of policy as adequate to cap underlying inflation at the current rate , not just to limit the rise .
 in addition , the committee might be concerned that the deterioration in financial markets witnessed over the past few months might be more likely to continue than to be reversed , suggesting greater downside than upside risks to aggregate demand .
 to be sure , oil prices , whose rise seems to explain a recent boost in near - term inflation expectations , could remain high and pose an inflationary threat .
 but long - term inflation expectations have been stable , and the staff and the futures markets expect a good deal of the runup in energy prices to be reversed .
 markets expect no adjustment in the funds rate at this meeting , but participants appear to have somewhat diverse views about the committee 's choice of the balance of risks .
 thus , their reaction to the choice of alternative b will depend largely on that balance assessment .
 anecdotal reports suggest that most investors still anticipate a statement of continued imbalance toward inflation risks , but a growing number do not and market prices have built in a policy easing by early next year .
 in these circumstances , the retention of an imbalance toward inflation risks at this meeting would induce market participants to push back the timing of policy easings , causing bond and stock prices to decline modestly .
 but prices would likely be bid up somewhat if balanced risks were chosen because participants would see this choice as raising the possibility of a near - term reduction in the target funds rate .",0," if the committee judges that core inflation probably will trend higher , as in the staff forecast , and finds the likely degree of economic weakness to be less of a concern , then it might want to act promptly to resist the acceleration in prices by tightening policy 25 basis points , as in alternative c .
 the need for action might seem particularly pressing if core inflation were viewed as having already moved above the range consistent with effective price stability in the long run .
 moreover , the committee may see a good chance that the trajectory of prices may be steeper than in the staff forecast .
 in that forecast , underlying inflation rises as productivity growth levels out and labor compensation continues to accelerate , reflecting in part the catch - up of real wages to previous increases in productivity .
 with the labor market quite taut and real wages having been held down recently by the effects of higher energy prices on overall inflation , the pressures for faster nominal wage increases might intensify more than the staff envisions .
 any increase in inflation expectations would accelerate that process .
 in that regard , the recent rise in near - term inflation expectations underscores the risk that longer - term inflation expectations may not remain anchored should oil prices fail to retreat .",0.25,,,0.0
75,2000-12-19," if the committee thinks that output growth is likely to slow appreciably more than envisioned in the staff forecast , then it might choose the 25 basis point easing of alternative a . such an assessment of growth prospects might reflect concern that the reduced pace of economic expansion , additional financial difficulties , and weaker earnings growth could be in the process of eroding consumer and business sentiment and tightening financial conditions more than in the greenbook .
 in this circumstance , a prompt easing of policy , by bolstering asset values and confidence , might help short - circuit this interactive process .
 easier policy also might be in order if the committee believes output growth along the lines of the staff forecast is likely , but reads the evidence as suggesting a considerably higher sustainable level of output , and hence a correspondingly lower nairu , than estimated by the staff .
 under these circumstances , even if the committee thinks that some reduction in the level of demand on productive resources is appropriate , it might want to ease policy slightly now given both the lags with which changes in policy influence the economy and the substantial rise in the unemployment rate projected by the staff .
 with no policy move expected at this meeting , adoption of alternative a would presumably trigger a rally in bond and stock markets and a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 the size of the resulting moves in asset markets would depend on the accompanying statement of the balance of risks .
 if the committee announced that it believed risks to be in balance , investors could well interpret the easing as the committee "" buying insurance "" against a possible further weakening of growth .
 such an action would probably be viewed as mostly bringing forward in time policy actions that market participants already anticipate , but the effects in financial markets still would be substantial .
 an even larger effect could be expected if the committee instead announced that risks appeared to be weighted toward economic weakness , as investors came to expect a greater cumulative easing of policy .",-0.25," if the committee shares the staffs assessment of the economic fundamentals and views a period of subpar economic growth as not only likely but also necessary to stabilize core inflation , it might prefer the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b . in addition , recent substantial revisions to the near - term outlook may suggest that the economic situation is quite fluid and that the degree of conviction about any particular outcome is relatively low .
 leaving policy unchanged would provide time for more evidence to accumulate that could potentially clarify the outlook for spending and productivity growth .
 of course , this benefit must be weighed against the potential costs of inaction .
 in the current circumstances , the committee may view economic conditions as implying that the potential costs of inaction at this meeting would be lower than usual if economic outcomes turn out differently than now anticipated .
 on the one hand , in the event of somewhat slower- than - expected economic growth going forward , the quicker dissipation of labor market pressures resulting from a short delay in easing policy might not be unwelcome , given that labor markets are very tight and inflation is probably at the high end of the range that might be considered acceptable in the long run .
 if , on the other hand , pressures on prices intensify because economic growth rebounds more promptly than expected or unit labor costs accelerate , then the committee should have sufficient time to react before higher inflation becomes entrenched because long- term inflation expectations appear to be firmly anchored .
 while financial market participants expect policy to be eased early in 2001 , they do not expect such an action at this meeting .
 they do anticipate that the committee will move to a statement of balanced risks , which would be seen as opening up the possibility of a shift in the stance of policy in the near term .
 given these expectations , the choice of alternative b with a statement of balanced risks should have little effect on financial markets .
 if the committee instead reiterated that the risks are weighted toward increased inflation pressures , investors likely would push back the timing and reduce the odds and likely extent of easier policy next year .
 in that case , interest rates and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would move higher , and equity prices would decline .
 by contrast , if the committee announced that risks were weighted toward economic weakness , investors likely would increase the amount and move forward the timing of expected easing going forward .
 bond and equity markets would rally , and the value of the dollar likely would decline .
 with the federal reserve seen as alert for signs of economic weakness , the response of markets to incoming data that pointed in that direction might be accentuated .",0," if the committee judges that core inflation already has moved above the range consistent with effective price stability , and that the prospects for a reversal given the current stance of policy are small , then it might be inclined to tighten policy 25 basis points , as in alternative c . such a move might appear more attractive if output growth were seen as unlikely to slow by as much as in the staff forecast , perhaps because the committee believes that equity investors have already taken reduced earnings prospects into account , and so views equity prices as more likely to resume at least a gradual uptrend than to be flat as in the staff forecast .
 moreover , the committee may be concerned about the upside risks to labor costs that could result from workers either attempting to reverse the hit to real wages that has resulted from higher energy prices or to catch up with previous increases in productivity at a time when the acceleration in productivity may have ended .",0.25,,,0.0

94,2004-03-16," with this view , the committee might wish to issue a statement structured like that shown in alternative a .
 the committee could convey a sense of its concerns through a somewhat less sanguine assessment of the labor market in the rationale paragraph .
 the third sentence could drop the reference to other indicators pointing to improvement in labor markets and state simply that “
 new hiring has been disappointing . ” adding a clause to this sentence suggesting that “ . . .and
 resource utilization generally appears likely to remain somewhat below levels consistent with the economy operating at its productive potential for some time ” would underscore the committee ’s concern about economic slack .
 the committee ’s assessment could be amplified still more by modest revisions to its characterizations of the balance of risks .
 for example , the committee might note that “ the probability , though minor , of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months but likely exceeds that of a rise in inflation . ”   interest rates would probably move a bit lower following an announcement of this sort .
 equity prices might be buoyed somewhat if the statement was read primarily as reaffirming the fomc ’s resolve to foster sustainable output growth at a pace sufficient to eliminate economic slack .
 the rise in stock prices could be damped or even reversed , however , if investors took the statement as implying higher odds that the vigor of economic growth could wane over coming quarters .
 money and debt forecast",0," at its last meeting , the committee instructed the staff to include a more complete analysis in the bluebook of possible wording choices for the policy announcement ( see box entitled “ some general issues concerning statement language ”   .
 given current economic circumstances and the committee ’s january policy announcement , the staff viewed a change in the federal funds rate at this some general issues concerning statement language as is evident in the chart below , the words of the fomc ’s statements are important :   the overall tone and content of fomc statements can elicit significant immediate market reactions and sometimes may color the way market participants respond to subsequent incoming news and events .
 but while “ words matter ” in fomc communications , statement language should not be viewed as an independent instrument of monetary policy .
 presumably , the statement influences markets because participants believe that it conveys information that bears directly or indirectly on potential future policy actions .
 thus , at least over the longer run , the importance of statement language depends on its connection with observed policy actions .
 the likely market reaction to an fomc statement is hard to judge .
 when the policy rate is changed , one can forecast the market reaction by using surveys and interest rate futures to measure ex - ante market expectations .
 when only the wording of the announcement is changed , predicting the market reaction is much more problematic .
 there is no simple way to map alternative wording in fomc statements into basis - point equivalents to arrive at the analogue of a policy rate change .
 and even if this were possible , one would still need to know the language that the market expects .
 these caveats notwithstanding , the discussion in this bluebook does hazard speculations about likely market reactions to alternative fomc statements ; these represent the staff ’s best guesses of the likely market reactions , but the confidence intervals are quite wide .
 as economic circumstances change over time , the alternatives presented in future bluebooks will generally include analyses of potential changes in the stance of policy as well as in the proposed wording of the associated statements .
 meeting as sufficiently unlikely that this bluebook presents three draft fomc statements associated with an unchanged funds rate .
 these alternatives
 a , b , and c in table 1–are differentiated solely by their characterizations of the economy in the rationale paragraph and in the balance - of - risks assessment.3 alternative b
-- shown in alternative b .",0," given this assessment , the committee might wish to issue a statement structured like that in alternative c .
 the committee could convey some sense of increased wariness about inflation pressures in the final sentence of the rationale paragraph by noting simply that “ to date , increases in core consumer prices have been muted and inflation expectations remain contained , ” eliminating the forward - looking phrase “ and are expected to remain low ” that appeared in the january statement .
 this tone could be reinforced by modest revisions in the balance - of - risks assessment .
 for example , the committee could indicate a slight change in its inflation outlook by stating that “ the probability of a rise in inflation about equals that of an unwelcome decline in inflation . ”   lastly , while the committee may not be prepared at this meeting to dispense with references to “ patience , ” it might wish to add a sentence that hints that its patience is not unlimited .
 this could be accomplished with an insertion so that the revised passage read , “ the committee recognizes that the stance of monetary policy has been quite accommodative for some time .
 nonetheless , with inflation low and resource use slack , the committee believes that it can still be patient in removing its policy accommodation . ”
 market participants would be quick to notice these revisions and , in all likelihood , would interpret the changes as further steps aimed at clearing the way for an eventual return of the target federal funds rate to a more neutral setting .
 interest rates likely would move up on that reading , resulting in a concomitant dip in stock prices , but the retention of some reference to patience would likely diminish the odds of an outsized market reaction .
 alternative",0,,,0.0
95,2004-05-04," while the committee might find some encouragement in the stronger tone of recent economic data , it may not yet be convinced that the expansion has become self - sustaining and may still expect inflation to remain low .
 in early 2002 , for instance , the expansion appeared to be gaining traction for a time and market expectations about the onset of tightening were building , but the expansion subsequently faltered .
 if the committee believed that the case for tighter policy would likely require at least several more months of evidence , it might choose a statement fairly close to the one released following the march meeting , as in alternative a .   with investment spending still reported to be primarily for replacement rather than for expansion and with only one month of reasonably strong employment data in hand , the committee may not yet be confident that business gloom has really lifted all that much .
 indeed , with the impetus to both household and business spending from expansionary fiscal policy expected to wane over coming quarters and financial conditions having tightened considerably of late , some members may be concerned that growth could fall back more than in the staff projection .
 the recent uptick in inflation might be seen as primarily the result of temporary factors and , therefore , leaving open the possibility that the underlying trend in inflation could edge lower ( much as is discussed in the “ inflation reversal ” simulation in the greenbook ) .
 moreover , some committee members might see the level of inflation over the past year as at the low end of its desirable range over the longer term and so may not be averse to a modest step - up .   against this backdrop , the committee may continue to view downside surprises to inflation as more costly than upside surprises , implying that a cautious approach to monetary policy tightening remains appropriate .
 if the committee finds sufficient merit in the selection of alternative a , it could issue a statement like that shown in the corresponding column of table 1 . while the recent increase in inflation should be noted , the statement could indicate that the rise is likely to be transitory : “ although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher , core inflation is expected to remain low . ”   even in this view , the risks to the attainment of price stability related in the assessment of risks paragraph would presumably be balanced .
 however , with the vigor of the expansion seen as less certain and the upside risks to inflation less pressing , the committee might choose to retain with only minor adjustment the sentence indicating its belief that it can be “ patient in removing its policy accommodation . ”
 market participants think that the committee is likely to modify or drop the reference to patience in the statement at this meeting , and its retention would probably lead them to push back somewhat the expected timing of policy tightening .
 the resulting decline in market interest rates would likely spark a modest rally in stock markets but weigh on the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 money and debt forecasts",0," the committee has multiple opportunities in its statement to indicate that the odds of policy firming in the near future are higher than at the march meeting , as shown in the column labeled alternative b in table 1 .
 at the same time , it might also offer a reason in the rationale paragraph why it does not see the need to tighten immediately by noting that “ longer - term inflation expectations appear to have remained well - anchored . ”   with the risks to the outlook balanced and the economy potentially picking up steam as the gloom that weighed on business investment and hiring disperses , committee members may feel that it is now appropriate to drop the sentence referring to patience in removing policy accommodation .
 such a change may be seen as particularly desirable if the committee believes that investors ’ confidence that interest rates will remain low has been encouraging the development of financial market imbalances that could have adverse macroeconomic effects as they unwind .
 however , members may be concerned that eliminating any characterization of the committee ’s future action might lead market participants to build in outsized expectations about the speed with which policy accommodation will be removed , thereby augmenting the considerable tightening in financial conditions of the past few weeks .
 the committee could convey the sense that its current outlook was consistent with a gradual return to a neutral policy stance by providing assurance at the end of the assessment of risks paragraph that , “ at this juncture , with inflation low and resource use slack , the committee believes that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace .
 ” even with the inclusion of such a sentence , however , a statement along these lines would likely lead market participants to bring a bit closer in time the expected date of the commencement of monetary policy tightening .
 in response , interest rates would rise , stock prices likely would decline , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would tend to appreciate .",0," if committee members were sufficiently confident that the expansion was now self - sustaining or saw the recent increase in core inflation as signaling an upturn in underlying inflation , then they might find an increase of ¼ percentage point in the federal funds rate at this meeting , as in alternative c , to be appropriate .
 the committee may view the advances in investment outlays , coupled with the more recent evidence that hiring is picking up , as suggesting that the tentativeness that had earlier marked business behavior has lifted .
 indeed , as increased hiring buoys incomes and consumer confidence , the resulting growth in spending may support faster gains in investment spending and employment than expected by the staff , implying a swifter erosion of resource slack .
 members may also be less confident than the staff that aggregate supply will continue to expand at a rapid pace and that the recent increases in energy and non - oil import prices will leave only a small imprint on inflation expectations .
 if so , the committee , like financial market participants , may see a significant risk that inflation could move higher , suggesting that the time has come to adjust policy .
 indeed , if the committee believes that expected inflation may rise , then it might see an increase in the target funds rate as necessary just to avoid a reduction in the real federal funds rate and a consequent easing of policy relative to measures of the equilibrium funds rate ( chart 5 ) .
 the argument for tighter policy would be strengthened to the extent that the committee wants to keep inflation near its recent lows over the longer term , rather than allowing some increase .
 while policy tightening might put some strains on financial markets for a time , committee members might not be convinced that the elevated uncertainty and financial market turbulence of 1994 - 95 is as relevant a precedent as some observers assert , in part because investors seem to expect that significant tightening will commence soon ( see box on “ lessons from the 1994 - 95 tightening cycle ” ) .

 lessons from the 1994 - 95 tightening cycle the current policy environment is similar in some respects to that prevailing before the policy tightening in 1994 - 95 .
 in both cases , an initially sluggish expansion in employment was accompanied by a real federal funds rate that fell to near zero for a time .
 the nominal federal funds rate target , shown in the left panel on the next page , is currently 2 percentage points lower than at the start of 1994 , reflecting in part the net decline in inflation over the intervening ten years .
 the policy tightening that began in february 1994 sparked a period of financial market turbulence that caused serious difficulties for some financial institutions .
 this adverse outcome has raised concerns about whether similar volatility could follow a move to tighter policy this year .
 the seemingly outsized market reaction to the 1994 - 95 tightening reflected several factors .
 first , many market participants had not fully expected a policy tightening at that time and so were poorly positioned .
 second , investors considerably underestimated the ultimate extent of tightening , though part of that forecast error reflected the surprising strength of the economy after the tightening process had begun .
 ( the staff was surprised as well , and the greenbook forecast of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 1994 fell about ¾ percentage point over the course of that year . )
 third , uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was high , particularly early in the tightening cycle .
 investors reacted to the changed economic and policy outlook by selling long - term securities to limit capital losses and hedge the lengthening durations of mortgage portfolios that resulted from higher interest rates .
 these portfolio adjustments at times took place over short periods of time , leading to volatile moves in long - term rates .
 as shown in the right panel , long - term yields increased almost as much as short - term rates early in the tightening cycle .
 to be sure , the historical record does suggest that changes in the direction of the policy rate tend to elicit a stronger market response than actions extending the existing trend in the policy rate .
 and the turbulence in financial markets last summer and fall may suggest that hedging flows will magnify the amplitude of any swings in longer - term interest rates .
 as a result , some firms with large interest rate exposures could face substantial losses when interest rates rise .
 that said , there are some signs that financial firms and markets may be able to handle policy tightening better than they did in 1994 .
 although the expected policy path is not as steep now as the actual tightening that took place ten years ago , it is nonetheless considerably steeper than that foreseen immediately before the first tightening in 1994 .
 even if interest rates do respond strongly to a move toward tighter policy , financial institutions appear better positioned to withstand the impact owing to improved risk - management practices .
 and , although the size of the mortgage market is now much larger , the recent run - up in interest rates has reduced prepayment rates enough to moderate the extent to which any further increase in rates will induce hedging flows .

96,2004-08-10,"-- under alternative a , the existing stance of policy would be maintained at this meeting .
-- some slowing in the pace of improvement in labor market conditions , ” as in alternative a .
 if the committee is concerned by the slow pace of progress in reducing resource slack projected in the greenbook or is worried that the forecasted rebound in growth could fail to materialize , it may prefer the unchanged policy stance of alternative a .   the sluggish consumption spending of late and the still - limited pickup in capital investment — even ahead of the expiration of the partial - expensing tax provisions at year - end — might be read by policymakers as suggesting that aggregate demand could remain soft for some time .
 such concerns about prospects for economic activity could intensify if the labor market report for july turns out to be surprisingly weak .
 the possibility that business and consumer confidence could be impaired by heightened terrorist threats might also be seen as posing some downside risk to spending and output .
 with inflation apparently moving down somewhat from its elevated levels of earlier this year and
 inflation expectations apparently contained , a brief hiatus in the process of firming policy might involve little risk of higher inflation and would permit the accumulation of additional data that could be helpful in assessing whether spending is rebounding in line with projections .
-- ”   consistent with its motivation for selecting alternative a , the committee might also wish to note that policy will be adjusted as appropriate to promote “ sustainable growth ” as well as price stability in the last sentence of the risk assessment section .",0," although the recent pace of economic growth has been less vigorous than projected in the june greenbook , the committee may still judge that the economy is poised for significant expansion going forward , as in the current staff forecast .
 under this view , a gradual tightening of monetary policy should be consistent with a pace of growth sufficient to make some headway in reducing economic slack while keeping inflation well contained .
 if the committee subscribes to such an outlook , it may find it appropriate to continue paring the degree of monetary policy accommodation and thus be attracted to the 25-basis - point firming at this meeting of alternative b .   policy likely will need to be firmed considerably over time :   the real federal funds rate , measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and lagged four - quarter core pce inflation , remains negative and below the estimates of its equilibrium value implied by selected staff models ( chart 5 ) .
 and given recent inflation trends , as well as the continued climb in crude oil prices in recent weeks , a further tightening of policy might be viewed as desirable to reduce the odds of an upturn in inflation expectations and more generally to help ensure that chart 5 actual real federal funds rate and range of estimated equilibrium real rates percent note : the shaded range represents the maximum and the minimum values each quarter of four estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate based on a statistical filter and the frb / us model .

 core inflation does not rise above acceptable levels .
 at the same time , the committee may believe that a gradual pace of policy adjustment will likely be sufficient to foster achievement of its goals , particularly given the apparent persistence of economic slack , which should help restrain inflation .
 also , the recent data may be read as hinting that the sluggishness in spending of the past few months might prove more protracted than forecast in the greenbook , arguing for only a modest firming step at this meeting .
 estimated policy rules generally suggest that a such a tightening at this meeting would be consistent with the committee ’s past policy conduct ( chart 6 ) .
 in announcing implementation of alternative b , the committee would presumably want to modify its previous statement that “ output is continuing to expand at a solid pace ” to acknowledge both the softness in economic activity in the past few months and the potential effects on economic prospects of energy price developments .
 one way to accomplish this would be to note that “ although output growth has moderated in recent months , the economy appears poised to expand at a solid pace going forward absent significant further increases in energy prices . ”   with regard to recent price developments , core consumer inflation was subdued on a monthly basis in june although the twelve - month inflation rate was higher than a year earlier .
 the committee may wish to retain the sense of its previous announcement regarding inflation while not putting excessive weight on the latest monthly data by saying “ recent inflation data have been somewhat elevated , though a portion of the rise in prices evidently reflects transitory factors . ”   if the committee finds the staff projection of aggregate demand and supply conditions plausible , it could reiterate its previous assessment that the risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability are balanced for the next few quarters .
 the committee might again wish to communicate a view of the likely pace of policy adjustment by stating that , “ with underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low . . .
 policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured , ” while also retaining the indication that it would tighten at a faster pace if necessary to maintain price stability .
-- the inflation sentence could well be similar to that under alternative b .   if fomc members are especially concerned that the recent weakness in spending might prove persistent , they might consider an assessment that risks to sustainable growth are weighted to the downside .",0.25," if the committee sees the recent slower growth of aggregate demand as likely to be transitory but suspects that the pickup in core inflation could well be more durable than the staff anticipates , it might choose to raise the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative c .
 fomc members may consider inflation already to be close to the top of an acceptable range and see several reasons to question the decline in inflation in the staff forecast .
 with inflation expectations remaining in a 2 to 3 percent range , well above the greenbook forecast , the committee may believe that underlying inflation has considerable momentum .
 also , 5 see “ a potential change in the wording of the risk assessment , ” memorandum to the federal open market committee from vincent reinhart , august 5 , 2004 .
 high energy prices may prove to be longer lasting than anticipated by the staff forecast and the markets , providing less downward pressure on overall inflation .
 policymakers may see less slack in prospect than in the greenbook projection , because they may perceive the economy as already close to its potential or the growth rate of potential output as lower than estimated by the staff .
 finally , committee members might be uneasy about inflation prospects if they place less weight on the most recent spending indicators and foresee more robust growth in aggregate demand than in the staff forecast , perhaps along the lines of the “ spending rebound ” scenario in the greenbook .
 in light of these considerations , the fomc may judge a 25-basis - point move at this meeting — which would leave the real funds rate in negative territory — as insufficient , whereas a 50-basis - point move would at least bring the real rate to around zero .
 with market participants interpreting a “ measured pace ” as implying at most 25-basis - point moves , policymakers probably would want to alter that phrase significantly or drop it from an announcement of alternative c .   while some policymakers might prefer not to provide guidance about the likely pace of policy change , they may be comfortable giving an indirect indication of its probable direction .
 if so , the last sentence of the announcement might read :
 “ in current circumstances , the committee believes that the existing degree of policy accommodation , if sustained over the next few quarters , could foster economic growth that is more likely to be above than below its long - run sustainable pace .
 similarly , with respect to the committee ’s goal of price stability , such an unchanged policy stance implies greater risks to the upside than the downside .
 given the explicit conditioning on the stance of policy in this assessment , a reference to the role of monetary accommodation in the first sentence of the rationale paragraph would be redundant .
 that paragraph might instead begin : “ the committee continues to believe that robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity . ”   if the committee thinks that the “ soft patch ” in the economy is probably behind us and that conditions are in place for a robust snap - back , it might also want to state that output growth “ appears poised to resume a stronger pace going forward . ”   to underscore its concerns about the effect of energy price increases on the inflation outlook , the committee might want to say : “ although a portion of the rise in inflation this year appears to have been due to transitory factors , continuing and substantial increases in energy prices are putting persistent upward pressure on costs and overall prices .
 unless the employment report for july turns out to be exceptionally strong , market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of a 50-basis- point move and the announcement proposed under alternative c .   the assessment of upside risks to growth and inflation and the deletion of the “ measured pace ”   language would reinforce the sense that the trajectory of policy would be steeper than previously anticipated .
 market interest rates would likely increase sharply , while stock prices would drop and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would rise .
-- if that language were dropped on tuesday , the market reaction to the announcement of conditional upside risks could be fairly sharp , approaching that expected under alternative c , as market participants would probably conclude that the fomc no longer believed that policy tightening was likely to be gradual .",0.5,,,0.25
97,2004-09-21,"-- under alternative a , the existing federal funds rate target would be maintained at this meeting .
 while the committee may be convinced that a sustainable economic expansion is in place , it may be concerned that the pace of output growth will not be sufficiently vigorous to make satisfactory progress in reducing economic slack .
 in the greenbook forecast , for instance , resource slack persists for much of the next two years and core inflation drifts lower .
 if the committee finds this to be undesirable , it may consider leaving the funds rate target unchanged at this meeting , as in alternative a .   the resulting easing of financial conditions would presumably better ensure satisfactory growth in aggregate demand .   a relatively slow pace of firming may be warranted by concerns that aggregate demand growth could be restrained in coming quarters by a number of factors , including efforts on the part of households to raise their saving rates and the drag of the widening trade deficit , and especially so if such factors develop more quickly or forcefully than in the greenbook outlook .
 in addition , in the staff forecast , persisting slack and lower energy and import prices impart a slight downtrend to core inflation that could bring it to levels that the committee might find uncomfortably low , given the limits to conventional policy maneuvering posed by the zero bound to nominal interest rates .
 the “ measured pace ” language would not seem to be an obstacle to pausing the process of firming , in that futures rates indicate that financial market participants already anticipate inaction at one of the next three meetings—
 although apparently not this one .
 indeed , a pause at this time might be seen as having the benefit of ensuring that market participants do not come inappropriately to view the “ measured pace ” language as a promise to firm policy at every meeting .",0," the committee , like the staff , may have read incoming data , on balance , as on the soft side , but it still may believe that the economic expansion will remain on track under current financial conditions , which incorporate market expectations of gradual policy firming .
 in such circumstances , the committee might find it appropriate to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative b .   even with the two tightening steps that the committee has taken to date , the real federal funds rate is still close to zero and near the bottom of the range of equilibrium values estimated by the staff ( chart 5 ) .
 the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 - 1/2 percent .

 a modest further reduction in accommodation would also be consistent with a number of monetary policy rules included in chart 6 .
 at the same time , though , some forces evidently are still weighing on current and prospective economic performance in a manner that may incline the committee to be cautious about the extent and speed with which it removes policy accommodation .
 in particular , crude oil prices , while falling back somewhat in recent weeks , remain high and could continue to limit growth in aggregate demand .
 looking forward , fiscal policy is poised to shift from stimulus to restraint at the end of this year as the investment expensing provision expires .
 and recent news on spending for high - tech equipment has been less upbeat .
 with regard to the announcement of alternative b , the committee could again repeat the themes that the stance of policy remains accommodative even after the policy move and that this stance , combined with strong trend productivity growth , is supporting economic activity .
 however , the committee presumably will wish to modify the next few sentences of the announcement to reflect the tenor of recent data .
 one way of updating the key points in the discussion of real - side developments would be to hold that :
 “ after moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices , output appears to have regained some traction .
 the pace of improvement in labor market conditions , however , remains modest . ”   in view of the recent string of relatively benign inflation reports , the committee might also wish to indicate that “ despite the rise in energy prices , inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months . ”   incoming data chart 6 actual and assumed federal funds rate and range of values from policy rules and futures markets percent percent shaded region is the range of values from rules

 # rmse calculated for 1999:1 - 2004:2 . would seem to support a renewed assessment that the risks to both sustainable economic growth and price stability are roughly balanced .
 and , as suggested above , the newly available evidence would also seem consistent with a judgment that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace .
 investors appear to have viewed incoming data over the intermeeting period as pointing to continued moderate economic expansion and limited pressures on inflation .
 this interpretation of the data , together with statements by the committee and individual policymakers , has suggested to market participants that the fomc almost certainly will firm another 25 basis points at this meeting , will again announce that the risks to sustainable growth and price stability are balanced , and will reiterate the view that policy can be tightened at a measured pace .
 accordingly , an action and an announcement along the lines of that proposed in alternative b should have little immediate effect in financial markets .
 the conditional nature of the statement makes it likely that investors will remain quite sensitive to key economic readings , such as reports on payroll employment and consumer prices , in the weeks that follow .
 should these data come in consistent with the staff forecast , interest rates may well edge lower on the building expectation that less cumulative policy tightening will be needed over the next few years than was previously anticipated .
-- as part of the rationale for leaving rates unchanged , the committee could employ the language for describing inflation developments that is proposed for alternative b , that is , “ despite the rise in energy prices , inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months . ”   even if the committee found good reason to pause in its process of firming policy , it might still perceive the risks to both growth and inflation as balanced .",0.25,"-- under alternative c , the funds rate would similarly be raised 25 basis points , but the language of the statement would be consistent with the possibility of more rapid firming than is currently built into financial prices .
 the committee may be concerned that greater - than - usual uncertainty surrounds the outlook for the economy as spending moves out of its recent soft patch .
 if the committee put much weight on the possibility that growth will rebound sharply , it may believe that the scope of its future action is constrained on the upside by the “ measured pace ” language and may prefer to drop the last two sentences from the statement , as is considered in alternative c .
 monetary policy has been highly accommodative for an extended period , and as noted , the real federal funds rate is currently about zero and may well be considerably below its equilibrium level .
 indeed , given the decline in longer - term yields and increases in equity prices , financial conditions likely eased further over the intermeeting period .
 policymakers may be concerned that this monetary stimulus could be stoking a buildup of overall inflationary pressures or fostering misalignments of asset prices .
 as to the former , if the prospects for aggregate supply were described not by the greenbook baseline but by the “ less room to grow ” alternative simulation ( in which the nairu is higher and the labor force participation rate does not rise any further to augment labor inputs ) , then the committee might envision more forceful action sometime soon .
 as to the latter concern about asset prices , some could view the rapid rise in home values , which presumably is being fed in part by the low level of real interest rates , as a possible manifestation of misallocation of resources and a potential threat to financial stability ( see box ) .
 removing the “ measured pace ” language would capture market attention and result in a tightening of financial market conditions that would provide some restraint on asset prices and inflation .
 housing prices and monetary policy over the last several years , real home prices in the united states have increased sharply ( left panel ) .
 moreover , house prices have risen well above gains in rents , indicating either an expectation of future significant increases in rents , a lowered risk premium , or a decline in the risk - free rate of discount .
 in any case , and as shown in the right panel , the price - rent ratio has moved well above its typical range , potentially raising some of the same challenges for monetary policy posed by the stock market boom in the late 1990s .
 with the value of homes accounting for about a quarter of household assets , changes in their prices could well have an appreciable effect on spending .
 in addition , a significant misalignment of housing prices could prompt resource misallocations .
 housing prices , however , are much less volatile than equity prices , suggesting that these developments would tend to unfold slowly , if at all .
 such concerns have led some observers to argue that the fomc take more explicit account of perceived deviations of house prices from fundamentals in formulating monetary policy .
 in particular , advocates of such an approach generally argue that it may be desirable to tighten more aggressively at present than would otherwise be the case so as to contain or even reverse the perceived asset price misalignment and thereby avoid an especially sharp and painful asset price correction at some future date .
 an alternative view is that monetary policy should respond to perceived asset price misalignments only to the extent that they contain information about the outlook for inflation and output .
 moreover , the available empirical evidence demonstrates only that asset ( house ) prices are high compared with predicted values from models based on historical behavior .
 models , however , are imperfect , and consequently it remains a judgment call whether this deviation really represents a departure from fundamentals or is a manifestation of changed fundamentals not fully accounted for by the model .
 even if house prices were known with certainty to be overvalued , the appropriate policy response is not obvious .
 more aggressive policy tightening might reduce the demand for real estate and gradually bring home prices in line with fundamentals , although the appropriate degree of tightening would be difficult to calibrate .
 if the misalignment , however , were viewed as likely to correct itself in short order , it might well be appropriate to ease policy ( or tighten less aggressively ) to cushion the expected fall in demand .
 given such uncertainties , the standard prescription is that monetary policy should be driven primarily by economic fundamentals–
 the outlook for output and inflation
 even when home prices or other asset prices may not be .
 adoption of alternative c would surprise market participants and , given the precedent of the marked reaction when the “ considerable period ” sentence was modified in january , could prompt significant swings in financial prices .
 the path expected for the funds rate would rotate up , and market participants probably would become somewhat more chary about risk - taking .
 equity prices , in all likelihood , 3   this forecast implies that the debt ceiling will be reached in the middle of october 2004 .

 money and debt forecasts",0.25,,,0.25
98,2004-11-10,"-- under alternative a , the federal funds rate target would be maintained at 1¾ percent at this meeting .
 given the disappointing data on employment and industrial production in recent months , along with the mixed signals from other economic indicators , the committee ’s assessment of the near - term prospects for spending and employment might be less optimistic than in the staff forecast .
 in particular , members might read the meager pace of hiring since the spring and weak high - tech spending as evidence of continued reluctance on the part of firms to make significant commitments in the current environment .
 the still - weak tone in labor markets also might be viewed as a factor depressing consumer confidence and so weighing on household spending .
 in that circumstance , the committee might see less need to continue removing policy accommodation at this meeting and choose to keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent and issue a statement like that shown in alternative a .   even if the committee judged the staff forecast as likely , it might consider the projected progress in working down slack as too slow to be acceptable , especially given that core pce inflation runs at 1½ percent — only a shade above the level prevailing in the summer of 2003 when concerns about disinflation were acute .
 the committee might also be concerned about possible downside risks to the forecast from high oil prices and the potential for a deceleration in consumer spending similar to that in the “ faltering expansion ” scenario in the greenbook .
-- ( 16 ) the announcement of alternative a would indicate an unchanged target federal funds rate but otherwise might look fairly similar to the announcement for the september meeting .",0," the current degree of stimulus provided by financial market prices embodies the expectation of tightening at this meeting followed by a brief pause .
 if the committee regarded the outlook for economic activity and inflation given these financial conditions as striking an appropriate balance between reducing slack and limiting inflation risks , it might wish to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points and issuing a statement similar to that of alternative b in the table , which includes language intended to signal a possible pause in the removal of policy accommodation .
 the committee might view a further quarter - point tightening at this meeting as an appropriate step in the direction suggested by standard policy benchmarks :   such a tightening would be consonant with the prescriptions from a battery of interest rate rules ( chart 5 ) and would boost the real federal funds rate nearer to the middle of the range of various measures of the equilibrium real interest rate ( chart 6 ) .

 such benchmarks might be heightened by the perceived need to be vigilant in response to the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the jump in some short - term measures of inflation compensation .   looking forward , though , the committee might regard a pause following this firming action as potentially prudent given the uncertainties attending the macroeconomic outlook .
 such a pause would allow the committee time to assess the underlying strength of aggregate demand and , given relatively anchored longer - term inflation expectations , might be viewed as imposing little cost .
 regarding the announcement of alternative b , the committee might signal the possibility of a pause by noting that the firming brings “ the cumulative increase in the target rate over the past several months to 1 percentage point . ”   a mention of the cumulative policy tightening would convey the sense that the committee was reflecting upon the extent to which accommodation had been removed .
 citing cumulative changes is a device last employed in the fomc statements of june and august 2001 .
 the sense that the committee was inclined to pause for a time might be reinforced by characterizing the stance of policy as remaining “ somewhat accommodative , ” rather than “ accommodative ” as in the september announcement , and would seem to parallel the committee ’s decision in january 2002 when it first characterized policy as accommodative when the funds rate was at 1 - 3/4 percent .
 the market reaction to the announcement for alternative b is difficult to gauge precisely .
 futures quotes indicate that market prices have largely , but not completely , built in a quarter - point tightening at wednesday ’s meeting , suggesting that such an action would probably impart a bit of upward pressure to near - term yields .
 in addition , options data indicate that investors attach some probability to scenarios in which the funds rate remains at 2 percent for a few meetings .
 nonetheless , the signal of a possible pause might cause investors to mark down the odds they currently seem to attach to tightening over the next several months .
 in such circumstances , longer- term yields could edge lower and stock prices might tick up .
-- given the actual pause in policy adjustment , the “ cumulative increase ” wording employed in alternative b would not seem necessary .",0.25," against the backdrop of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar , the committee might believe that inflation pressures under the greenbook policy assumption are unlikely to be as well - contained as in the staff forecast .
 indeed , both market- and survey - based measures of near - term inflation expectations moved higher over the intermeeting period .
 faced with these developments , the committee might wish to tighten policy a quarter - point and adopt the firmer statement language shown for alternative c .   even if the committee found the staff forecast of a gradual decline in inflation to be both likely and generally acceptable as a modal assessment , it might be concerned about upside risks to the outlook .
 in particular , as discussed in the “ more inflation ” scenario in the greenbook , inflation could pick up markedly if the rise in oil prices were to trigger a significant increase in long - term inflation expectations .
 moreover , the committee might harbor some concerns that inflation pressures could build if — as envisioned in the “ slower productivity ” greenbook simulation — the favorable productivity growth trends witnessed in recent years fade over time .
 in such circumstances , policy might need to be tightened relatively briskly at coming meetings , perhaps inclining the committee to be reluctant to hint now that it might pause in the process of firming .
 the announcement of alternative c could cite the increase in the target rate to 2 percent with no intimation of a pause any time soon .
 the stance of policy might still be characterized simply as “ accommodative ” and the rationale paragraph might note that “ rising energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to contribute to upward pressure on prices ” so as to highlight concerns about inflation .
 the committee could retain the measured pace language and might also continue to assess the risks to growth and price stability as balanced , particularly if it viewed that assessment as conditioned on an assumption of appropriate policy .",0.25,,,0.25
99,2004-12-14,"-- in alternative a , the federal funds rate would remain at 2 percent .
 if the committee were concerned that maintenance of current financial conditions could risk a return to subpar economic performance , it might want to consider a pause in the tightening cycle at this meeting , as in alternative a .
 recent data and anecdotal reports suggest that businesses remain unusually cautious in expanding payrolls .
 in addition , the expiration of the partial expensing provision at year - end could slow investment spending more than in the greenbook .
 moreover , household saving rates remain very low by historical standards , and a larger - than- expected rebound in saving propensities could damp household spending considerably .
 given these uncertainties , and with 100 basis points of tightening already in place , the committee might consider it prudent to stand pat at this meeting to foster easier financial market conditions and weigh incoming data before considering the appropriate course for policy in february .
 the announcement of alternative a could look much like the one released following the november meeting .
 however , in view of the concerns about renewed economic weakness that presumably would motivate policymakers to adopt this alternative , the committee might wish to characterize the current stance of policy as only “ somewhat accommodative ” and indicate that “ labor market conditions have been improving only gradually , apparently evidencing continued business caution . ”
 the statement could also note policymakers ’ obligation to promote “ sustainable growth ” as well as price stability .
 the announcement of this policy choice would surprise investors , and real and nominal interest rates would likely decline , especially at shorter maturities , putting downward pressure on the dollar .
 stock prices might rise , although the sense that aggregate demand might be weaker than investors had perceived could lead them to revise down their outlook for profits , tending to offset the positive effect of lower interest rates on equity prices .
 money and debt forecasts",0," the committee may believe that , as in the greenbook forecast , fostering sustainable economic growth and price stability will likely involve continued policy tightening but at a less rapid pace going forward than has been the case over the past six months .
 for example , members may expect only gradual diminution of the business caution that has damped the economic expansion over the last few years despite unusually accommodative monetary policy .
 if the committee held such a view , it might want to couple a 25-basis - point move at this meeting with a statement like that in alternative b , which is intended to signal the possibility of a pause in the adjustment of policy before long .
 while an additional hike in rates at this meeting would be consistent with a number of standard policy rules ( chart 6 ) , some of those rules also suggest a pause fairly soon if output and inflation evolve as projected in the greenbook .

 money market futures rates suggest that market participants already place some probability on a slowing in the rate of policy tightening , but if the committee saw a pause before long as fairly likely it might want to convey that expectation at this meeting .
 the possibility of a pause in the tightening process could be signaled by noting in the statement that “ the committee ’s policy actions since mid-2004 have resulted in a significant reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation .
 the statement could go on to say that “ nonetheless , . . .
 the stance of policy remains somewhat accommodative ” rather than characterizing the current stance of policy simply as “ accommodative ” as in the november statement .
 the reference to the reduction in policy accommodation would suggest to investors that committee members were considering the effects of the cumulative policy adjustment to date , and that , with policy now viewed as only “ somewhat ” accommodative , policymakers might be ready to slow the pace of firming .
 however , a statement along these lines would leave open the option of tightening again at the february meeting if incoming information suggested that another move was appropriate .
 for example , the committee pointed to the cumulative easing of policy in its june 2001 statement , but it nonetheless eased policy further at its august meeting .
 5 another option under alternative b would be for the committee to indicate that “ the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2¼ percent , bringing the cumulative increase in the target rate over the past several months to 1¼ percentage point .
 ( analogous language was presented in the november bluebook . ) such a quantification of the cumulative increase in the funds rate would be another means of suggesting that the fomc was considering an adjustment to the policy trajectory going forward , and indeed the committee adopted such an approach in its june 2001 statement .
 a disadvantage of this wording is that on its face it would appear to be nothing more than a simple arithmetic statement .
 also , if the committee elected not to pause in february , it would be necessary either to update the arithmetic by changing the reference from 1¼ percentage points to 1½ percentage points or to rewrite the statement more substantially .
 the release of the announcement for alternative b would likely lead to some easing of financial conditions .
 although investors have priced in a 25-basis- point increase in the target federal funds rate at this meeting , they do not anticipate that the statement will signal the possibility of a pause .
 as a result , the statement could well induce investors to mark down their expected path for the federal funds rate over coming quarters .
 short- and intermediate - term interest rates would decline some , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably also fall .
 stock prices would likely rise a bit .",0.25," if the committee views developments over the intermeeting period as having provided further evidence that the expansion is solidly on track , then it might be inclined to continue removing policy accommodation at a measured pace by tightening policy another 25 basis points at this meeting .
 should the committee also expect that substantial further tightening will be desirable fairly soon , then it might want to issue a statement such as that in alternative c , which does not hint at a possible pause in tightening at coming meetings .
 despite the four policy moves over the past several months , the real federal funds rate remains below the lower end of the 70 percent confidence band around the estimates of the short - run equilibrium real interest rate derived using the staff ’s new methods .
 the current rate is also below the estimate of the equilibrium rate that is implicit in the greenbook forecast .

 these revised estimates may suggest that a somewhat more rapid and substantial tightening than previously perceived may be required to remove policy accommodation and head off a buildup of inflationary pressures .
 in addition , members may anticipate more slowing in the underlying pace of productivity growth than does the staff .
 such a development would add to upward pressure on unit labor costs , and hence on overall inflation rates .
 also , the committee may believe that effective labor market slack going forward could turn out to be quite limited — for example , if labor market participation , which has yet to turn distinctly higher , fails to increase as much as in the staff forecast .
 in either case , the committee might anticipate that aggregate demand will continue to expand at a pace above that of its potential for some time and consequently deem considerable further progress toward a more neutral policy stance desirable over coming months .
 alternative
 c would also seem appropriate if members were concerned that longer - term inflation expectations could move higher were the committee not seen as responding sufficiently to inflationary impulses emanating from the decline in the dollar and the previous rise in oil prices .
 the statement in alternative c could be quite similar to that released following the november meeting .
 in light of the relatively soft employment report for november , however , the announcement could indicate that labor market conditions “ continue to improve gradually . ”   also , in view of the significant decline in oil prices in recent weeks , the clause on output could be revised to refer to the “ earlier ” rise in energy prices .
 the general similarity of the language to that employed in november and the continued characterization of the policy stance as “ accommodative ” would avoid the suggestion that the committee believes a pause in policy tightening is likely in the near term .
 as drafted , the statement retains a balanced assessment of risks to sustainable growth and price stability — an assessment that some members might see as conditioned on an appropriate path for policy going forward — as well as new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate this bluebook introduces new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate .
 the new estimates were developed to address shortcomings of the earlier measures that , as reported in the bluebook readership survey , made them difficult to interpret.1 one problem with the earlier measures was that the concept underlying the measures was not defined clearly .
 for example , the time horizon — the period over which the output gap would be projected to close if the real funds rate were kept at its equilibrium level — differed across measures and was not clearly specified .
 second , the chart summarizing the various measures may have given a misleading picture of the uncertainty surrounding the point estimates .
 finally , the two - sided estimates that were included would seem to be inappropriate for real - time policymaking .
 the new chart reports two kinds of equilibrium rate measures , differing in terms of their time horizon .
 the short - run equilibrium rate is defined to be the rate that , if sustained , would be projected to close the output gap in twelve quarters .
 the medium - run measure is defined to be the rate projected to prevail in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy will act to eliminate economic slack in three years and to hold output at potential thereafter .
 the new estimates are calculated based on three different models : a single - equation model of the output gap , a small structural model consisting of equations for five key macroeconomic variables , and the staff ’s large - scale model ( frb / us ) .
 in addition to the range encompassing the point estimates of the three models , the chart also displays confidence bands that illustrate the uncertainties surrounding the range of model estimates .
 also shown are the greenbook - consistent measure of the short - run equilibrium rate — which is based on a version of the frb / us model that has been adjusted to match the greenbook forecast — and the medium - run equilibrium rate consistent with tips yields .
 the new model - based estimates shown in this bluebook suggest a higher current level for the equilibrium real federal funds rate than did the range based on the old methods that was included in the november bluebook .
 this difference occurs mainly because we have dropped the measures based on the statistical - filter model , which exhibited implausibly large responses to surprises in output .
 the greenbook- consistent measure currently yields an equilibrium rate lower than model - based estimates because the greenbook projects that the recent weakness in aggregate demand will diminish more gradually than the models predict .
 it should be noted that the appropriate stance of policy relative to the equilibrium estimates in a given instance will depend on policymakers ’ objectives and the projected paths for output and inflation .
 thus , these estimates of the equilibrium rate should not be interpreted as policy prescriptions , but rather as potential inputs to the policy process .
 the new estimates are shown in chart 5 .
 the chart is accompanied by a brief set of explanatory notes ; further details are provided in flint brayton and david reifschneider , “ revised bluebook estimates of the equilibrium real rate – overview , ” and “ revised bluebook estimates of the equilibrium real rate – technical documentation , ” memorandums to the fomc , december 7 , 2004 .

 measure description single - equation model
 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
 large m odel ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using frb / us— the staff ’s large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
 tips - consistent yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) incorporate investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates .
 the seven - year instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields reflects the short - term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium .
 the term premium is assumed to be 70 basis points .
 the “ measured pace ” language .
 if the committee nonetheless thought the margins of unused capacity could be relatively narrow and wanted to convey somewhat greater concern about the inflation outlook , it might do so by noting in the rationale paragraph that labor market conditions “ continue to improve , ” without indicating that the improvement was gradual , and that “ the earlier rise in energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to contribute to upward pressure on prices .
 market participants have essentially priced in a 25-basis - point rise in the federal funds target at this meeting and anticipate only relatively small changes in the statement .
 as a result , an announcement like that in alternative c would likely have little effect on financial markets .
 however , a statement that included a reference to possible inflation pressures would presumably lead investors to boost their expected path for the federal funds rate , increasing real and nominal interest rates and weighing on stock prices .
 such a statement would also likely raise the sensitivity of market participants to inflation news over the intermeeting period .",0.25,,,0.25
100,2005-03-22,"-- under alternative a , the funds rate also would be raised 25 basis points , but the 3 the committee has accompanied its six prior tightenings with assessments that the risks to both of its goals were balanced , which indicates that those assessments have implicitly been conditioned on an appropriate path of policy .
 if the committee instead views recent higher inflation readings as largely transitory , it may wish to firm policy by a quarter point at this meeting and issue a statement like that described under alternative a .   with longer - term inflation expectations well - contained and resource slack apparently being worked down slowly , the committee may see relatively little cost in continuing along a path of gradual removal of policy accommodation .
 indeed , the committee may want to choose the words of its statement so as to keep market participants from marking up their expected path of tightening .
 this might be so even if the committee anticipates that resource slack is likely to be eliminated fairly soon , if it also saw downside risks to that forecast — such as are discussed in the “ higher bond premiums ” scenario in the greenbook — as significant given the recent run - up in interest rates and rise in oil prices .
 under either alternative a or c , the committee may judge that the measured - pace language is no longer consistent with the likely future course of policy .
 some might view this wording — at least as it has come to be interpreted in the markets after six quarter - point firmings with unchanged language — as ruling out a potential pause in policy at upcoming meetings .
 at the same time , that wording might be regarded as potentially constraining on the upside if the committee saw a significant likelihood that it might need to accelerate the process of removing policy accommodation .
 indeed , members might not choose to firm 50 basis points at this meeting because of the force of such a constraint .
 as a result , the committee might wish to strike the measured - pace language from its statement at this meeting .
 to accomplish this while still providing a general signal about the probable future direction of policy , the committee could make its risk assessments conditional on an class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 37 unchanged target federal funds rate for the next few quarters .
 for alternatives a
 and c , the committee could then indicate that it is “ more likely than not ” that the growth of output would exceed its sustainable pace and that inflation pressures would pick up .
 the last sentence of the paragraph could underscore the importance of “ economic prospects ” as a guide for policymakers in judging the pace at which policy accommodation should be removed .
-- under alternative a , the rationale paragraph would suggest that the committee sees the stance of monetary policy as “ somewhat ” accommodative and regards the recent uptick in inflation readings as transitory , with underlying inflation and inflation expectations remaining well - contained .
-- the market reaction to adoption of alternative a is more difficult to gauge , but the mention of cumulative firming , upbeat assessment of inflation prospects , and the characterization of the stance of policy as only “ somewhat ” accommodative in the rationale paragraph should tend to put some downward pressure on yields .",0.25,"-- under alternative b , the funds rate would be raised 25 basis points at this meeting .
-- however , explicitly stating that conditionality , as in alternative b , will probably limit the usefulness of this form of the risk assessment in signaling the likely direction of future policy moves .
-- these alternatives may contain elements of statement language that the committee might find more appealing than the wording of alternative b or may be helpful in informing potential changes in the policy announcement over the next few meetings .
 if the committee found the greenbook forecast for output and inflation conditional on continued gradual removal of policy accommodation both plausible and acceptable , it might choose to raise the target federal funds rate ¼ percentage point at this meeting and issue a statement like that shown for alternative b in table 1 .
 the committee might view this action as consistent with the measured - pace language of the february statement and appropriately validating current market expectations of continued gradual firming .
 while there are some signs of greater pressures on inflation — as evidenced by more rapid growth in producer and commodity prices and a possible further increase in near - term inflation expectations — resource slack lingers , labor costs have only edged up , and firms class

 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 18 of 37 probably have scope to absorb some increase in costs by reducing profit margins .
 a quarter - point firming at this meeting presumably to be followed by further increases over time could be seen as sufficient to cut off the inflation pressures already in the pipeline , especially so if the committee harbors doubts about the continued vigor of the expansion given the sharp rise in oil prices and the backup in long - term rates .
 according to the desk ’s survey of primary dealers and anecdotal reports , market participants universally anticipate a quarter - point firming in policy at this meeting and generally expect only relatively minor changes to the statement language .
 as a result , it seems likely that the market reaction to alternative b would be fairly muted .
 however , investors would take note of the reference to the pickup of inflation pressures and would conclude that the committee believed that “ appropriate policy ” would most likely entail more policy firming than previously expected .
 consequently , yields would probably tick up a few basis points following the announcement while stock prices could fall back a bit .",0.25,"-- under alternative c , the funds rate would be boosted 50 basis points , and the accompanying statement would give more emphasis to the perception of upside inflation risks .
 the committee might view recent elevated readings on some price measures as providing a stronger signal of heightened inflation pressures than does the staff .
 in this case , the committee may wish to raise the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points and issue a statement like that described for alternative c .
 this option might be viewed as particularly appealing if the committee thought that underlying productivity growth had slowed substantially or that output was already approaching , or had even outstripped , potential .
 even if the committee generally believes that inflation and inflation expectations are likely to remain well - contained under the gradual trajectory of policy tightening assumed in the greenbook , it may view the upside risks to that forecast — which are explored in the “ spending boom with rising inflation expectations ” scenario in the greenbook — as sufficiently worrisome to justify a half - point move at this meeting .
 in light of the apparent momentum of aggregate demand , the committee may perceive the risk that market class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 19 of 37 participants come to view it as wavering in its commitment to keep inflation in check as more serious than the risk that market participants begin to build in an inappropriately tight path for monetary policy .
-- ( 17 ) market participants would be caught off guard by the 50 basis point tightening of alternative c .    moreover , investors could infer from the concerns expressed about inflation and the removal of the measured - pace language that further half - point policy tightenings could well be forthcoming .",0.5,,,0.25
101,2005-05-03," if the committee is reasonably sure that inflation will be well contained but is concerned that spending and output growth may have lost significant momentum of late and that progress in reducing resource slack may have stalled , it 4 members might interpret the adverse news over the intermeeting period as raising the probabilities of outsized deviations of spending growth below that which is sustainable and inflation above that consistent with price stability .
 such skewed risks might be expected to remain even after policy is set appropriately , implying that the committee would view the risks to its two objectives individually as unbalanced — and in a manner that has offsetting implications for policy .
 however , much was made in markets of the committee ’s explicit conditioning of the risk assessment on appropriate policy and the conclusion generally drawn was that it was close to tautological .
 while the selection of unbalanced risks is logically possible in the presence of significantly skewed probabilities , another change on the heels of the introduction of an explicit reference to appropriate policy would likely bewilder market participants .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 18 of 40 may wish to combine a 25-basis - point firming of policy at this meeting with statement language that strongly suggests the possibility of a pause in firming at the june meeting , as in alternative a .   true , the committee has repeatedly conveyed in its minutes that the “ measured pace ” language is consistent with a pause in the process of tightening , and market participants have priced in high odds of such a possibility later this year .
 but it can not be ruled out that the present configuration of market prices is conditioned on the expectation that the statement will be used to signal the possibility of a pause in policy tightening .
 if so , the committee might see merit in being more explicit .
 a more gradual elimination of accommodation might be appealing in light of the downward revision of nearly ¾ percentage point in the short - run measure of the equilibrium real interest rate consistent with the greenbook forecast ( the first line in the table in chart 5 ) ; by that index , the real funds rate would be less than ¼ percentage point below its estimated equilibrium value after implementation of this alternative .
 in addition , a 3 percent nominal federal funds rate would sit high in the range of policy recommendations from simple policy rules provided in chart 6—and especially so if members viewed 2 percent inflation in the core pce index as an acceptable outcome .
 a gloomy view of the risks to the outlook for spending would presumably also incline the committee to signal a pause .
 for instance , economic activity could be weaker in coming quarters than in the staff forecast for the reasons explored in the “ sentiment slump ” and “ sentiment slump with financial spillover ” scenarios in the greenbook .
 as another possibility , members may be of the view that the slowing in spending and activity of late owes less to elevated energy prices and more to the cumulative monetary policy restraint put in place since june of last year than is implicit in the greenbook .
 5    pausing to assess the effects already in the pipeline from cumulative 5 while most longer - term yields remain below their levels just before tightening commenced ,
 short- and intermediate - term yields are now much higher .
 those latter increases may be crimping spending more than the staff has allowed for , either because the economy is now more sensitive to class

 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 21 of 40 policy restraint might therefore be in order , especially in light of the recent behavior of the stock market , bond spreads , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
 market participants would not likely miss the hints in the announcement of alternative a of a higher likelihood of a pause in june .
 intermediate- and longer-
 term interest rates probably would drop appreciably , and equity markets would rally .
 the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would decrease along with the drop in u.s .

 in any event , market participants would likely be especially sensitive to readings on inflation over the upcoming intermeeting period .",0.25,"-- apart from updating the description of recent economic conditions , the statement under alternative b could be quite similar to that issued following the march fomc meeting .
 although recent economic data have pointed to noticeably less strength in spending and output in the first half of 2005 than anticipated at the time of the march meeting , the committee may still be inclined to tighten policy another 25-basis - point notch at this meeting , as in alternative b .
 the committee might share the view of the staff that , even after additional policy firming , growth in economic activity will exceed , albeit only slightly , the rate of expansion of potential output in coming quarters .
 such an outlook accords with staff estimates of the equilibrium real rate of interest , which remain above the current level of the real class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 14 of 40 federal funds rate ( chart 5).3   indeed , some relatively immediate increase in the nominal funds rate may be seen as necessary to prevent the real funds rate from declining as the result of the recent uptick in inflation .
 while the absence of much further progress in working down resource slack in this forecast may not be particularly attractive , policymakers might believe that the current situation is best described as one in which the economy has been hit by an adverse supply shock emanating from the ratcheting higher of oil prices .
 in such a circumstance , fate deals monetary policymakers an unappealing hand , in that pursuing greater resource utilization more aggressively could put price stability at risk and ensuring that inflation is kept in check could require a worsening of resource slack .
 the draft statement associated with alternative b updates the wording of the march release in light of recent information on spending , employment , and inflation .
 as shown in table 1 , the committee could indicate that “ recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat , partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices .
 labor market conditions , however , apparently continue to improve gradually . ”   in view of the elevated cpi figures for the past couple of months , and more generally in recognition of increased uncertainty about the interpretation of recent inflation news , the draft wording for alternative b also suggests that the committee omit the view expressed in march that “ the rise in energy prices , however , has not notably fed through to core consumer prices .
 ( the committee ’s consideration of such a change , however , could depend on the march reading on pce prices , which will be released on the friday before the meeting . )
 if the committee drops that sentence , it might wish to reverse the order of the thoughts in the first sentence on inflation that appeared in 3 starting with this bluebook , the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real interest rate incorporates an upward adjustment of 40 basis points to account for the anticipated average difference between total cpi inflation ( the basis for tips indexation ) and core pce inflation ( the basis for computing inflation expectations in the other measures ) .

 explanatory notes the equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained , would be projected to return output to its potential level over time .
 the short - run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given
 a model ’s projection of the economy , and the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .
 the real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .
 since tips indexation is based on the total cpi , the tips - consistent measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between cpi inflation and core pce inflation .
 measure description single - equation model
 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
 large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using
 frb / us—
 the staff ’s
 large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
 tips - consistent yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) incorporate investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates .
 the seven - year instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date reflects the short - term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years .
 this forward rate is adjusted down for a term premium , assumed to be 70 basis points , and adjusted up for the difference between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation , projected to be 40 basis points in the medium run .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 17 of 40 the march announcement to avoid communicating an excessively pessimistic view of inflation prospects .
 apart from such updating , the announcement could be similar to the one issued after the march meeting .
 in particular , it would seem— assuming that members share an economic outlook broadly in line with that of the staff
 —that the committee could retain its assessment of balanced risks to both sustainable growth and price stability under the assumption of “ appropriate monetary policy action ” that it adopted in march as well as its judgment that removal of policy accommodation can proceed at a measured pace.4
 investors appear certain that the committee will boost the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting .
 also , most expect that the fomc will not make major changes to its announcement , apart from those necessary to align the description of economic conditions with newly available information .
 while a growing minority of market participants in recent days have come to expect the “ measured pace ” language to be shed , it is hard to tell whether they would view such an outcome as a signal of a stepped - up pace of firming or of a pause .   assuming that those differing interpretations about offset each other , there is little reason to suspect that the market reaction to the adoption of alternative b would be significant .",0.25,"-- under alternative c , the federal funds rate would be boosted 50 basis points , and the language would be modified substantially .
 should the committee be particularly concerned that underlying inflation pressures may be intensifying , it might be attracted to the 50-basis - point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative
 members may be more inclined than the staff to assign signal , rather than noise , to the jump in the march cpi .
 also , prices of far - dated crude oil futures contracts have remained elevated over the period since the last greenbook , which could be seen as implying little likelihood of a significant unwinding of the previous run - up in energy costs .
 as discussed in an alternative scenario in the greenbook , firms might pass on to their customers more of the higher energy costs than in the baseline forecast .
 moreover , actual productivity growth appears to have slowed over recent quarters , and committee members might be concerned that structural labor productivity will decelerate by more than incorporated in the staff projection .
 taken together , higher energy prices and slower underlying productivity growth may be viewed as an especially adverse supply shock that lowers output in a manner that should be accepted rather than resisted .
 abstracting from such gloom about aggregate supply ,
 last summer ’s episode , as well as broader economic experience , suggests that “ soft patches ” crop up from time to time and do not necessarily threaten robust expansion of aggregate demand over a longer period .
 if the committee believes that economic growth is likely to remain solid , it could move to check elevated inflation pressures by more vigorous policy action at this meeting .
 the words of alternative c ( from row 2 down ) might have an appeal even if the committee chose to firm 25 basis points at this meeting .
 c - lite ” approach would convey a sense that the committee wished to ensure that the market understood that future policy options spanned a wider range than the current statement might appear to some to allow .
 as long as references to the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 23 of 40 accommodative stance of policy remain elsewhere in the statement , market participants would interpret that flexibility as introducing a tilt toward a firmer , rather than an easier , funds rate .
 removing all forward - looking guidance would require excising characterizations of the degree of accommodation as well as the “ measured pace ” language .
 as indicated in table 1 , the committee could consider a number of alterations to its statement in association with the selection of alternative c to convey a heightened concern about inflation prospects .
 for example , the committee could strike the reference to “ robust underlying growth in productivity ” in the second sentence .
 in addition , it could choose not to focus on the apparent recent slowing in output growth and simply note that “ output continues to grow at a pace sufficient to eliminate any remaining resource slack . ”   with regard to inflation , the committee would probably wish to delete the sentence in the previous announcement that “ the rise in energy prices , however , has not notably fed through to core consumer prices .
 ”   given the conditioning assumption of “ appropriate monetary policy , ” the committee could retain its assessment that the risks to attainment of sustainable growth and price stability are balanced .
 however , if the committee wanted to gain flexibility to tighten policy at a faster pace in the future , it presumably would delete the risk assessment and the sentence expressing its belief that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured .
 ( the characterization that policy is accommodative elsewhere in the statement would remain as the sole signal of the direction of future action . )
 even after these deletions , the committee might wish to underscore that its future actions would depend on evolving economic outcomes by indicating , with a nod to its dual objectives , that “ the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 40
 the selection of the 50-basis - point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c would come as a considerable surprise to market participants .
 that hike , coupled with some or all of the changes in announcement wording discussed in the previous paragraph , would prompt investors to revise sharply upward their expectations for the path of monetary policy in the near term and likely beyond , and thus would have a pronounced effect on financial markets more generally .
 interest rates would rise substantially across the yield curve , equity prices would probably decline , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could increase significantly .
 the same language associated with a quarter - point increase in the funds rate would also send markets in the same direction , but to a lesser extent . money and debt forecasts",0.5,,,0.25
102,2005-08-09,"-- in contrast , the announcement accompanying alternative a would hint at a near - term slowing in the pace of policy tightening , in part by noting that policy accommodation has been substantially reduced .
 recognizing that the cumulative tightening put in place over the past year has substantially reduced the degree of monetary policy accommodation , the committee may believe that the real federal funds rate is now nearing its equilibrium level .
 in view of such an assessment as well as the subdued readings on core inflation in recent months , the fomc might opt for alternative a ’s combination of a 25-basis - point hike in the funds rate at this meeting and a statement that hints that the committee could soon slow the pace of policy firming .
 this alternative would seem particularly attractive if members thought that slack in labor markets was greater than in the staff assessment , implying less need to tighten policy than in the greenbook .
 even if the committee believed that it would probably need to tighten policy somewhat further following a quarter - point step on tuesday , a near - term pause might be viewed as prudent to allow more time to evaluate the effects of its cumulative policy action to date .
 a funds rate path incorporating a quarter - point tightening at class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 15 of 35 this meeting followed by a shallower trajectory of tightening would be consistent with the prescriptions from several policy rules ( chart 6 ) .
 the draft statement associated with alternative a could indicate that “ the committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has been substantially reduced , ” while again acknowledging that the expansion remains firm and that labor market conditions continue to improve gradually .
 particularly if the committee were concerned about a possible slackening in the pace of trend productivity growth , it might wish to eliminate the previous language pointing to robust underlying productivity growth as a factor supporting the expansion .
 with regard to prices , the statement could indicate that “ core inflation has been relatively low in recent months , and longer - term inflation expectations remain well contained , ” dropping the reference to inflation pressures .
 in the penultimate sentence , the fomc could indicate that “ remaining ” policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace .
 alternatively , if the committee judged that the real federal funds rate now was in the neighborhood of its equilibrium level , it might choose to drop the “ measured pace ” sentence entirely , thus suggesting that further firming could prove to be unnecessary .
 market participants expect that the path of the intended federal funds rate will begin to flatten out around year - end , but market commentary and survey evidence indicate that investors do not anticipate that the fomc will signal any such development next week .
 accordingly , a statement employing the draft wording shown in alternative a would likely produce a noticeable downward shift in interest rates implied by money market futures quotes , as investors priced in a slower pace of policy action and probably also revised down the likely extent of cumulative tightening .
 that change in policy outlook would likely prompt a rally in bond and equity markets and some depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar .

 according to those estimates , continued policy firming at a pace of 25 basis points per meeting would bring the real funds rate within the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value by november .
 but even if members believe that such a sequence of policy actions is likely to produce sufficient restraint on inflation , they might judge it premature to send any signal at this time that the course of policy tightening is nearing completion .
 indeed , in light of the recent indications of strong economic activity , policymakers may have boosted their sense of the degree of policy tightening that will prove necessary and may now even see an appreciable probability that the federal funds rate will need to be raised for a time above its estimated short - run equilibrium value .
 even with such an assessment , though , members may judge that continuing to tighten policy at a measured pace , albeit over a slightly longer period than previously anticipated , should provide adequate restraint on spending and inflation .
 as shown in table 1 , the statement for alternative b updates the wording employed in june in light of incoming data on spending , output , and employment by noting that “ aggregate spending , despite high energy prices , appears to have strengthened since late winter , and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.”5   the committee might acknowledge incoming price data by noting that “ core inflation has been relatively low in recent months , ” and , with both survey and tips - based measures of inflation expectations little changed , it could reiterate that “ longer - term inflation expectations remain well contained . ”   however , it might wish to emphasize that “ pressures on inflation have stayed elevated ” by moving that thought to the end of the sentence .
 the statement could again indicate that “
 with appropriate monetary policy action , the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal . ”   that 5 this statement will need to be reviewed in light of friday ’s labor market report .

 explanatory notes the equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained , would be projected to return output to its potential level over time .
 the short - run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given
 a model ’s projection of the economy , and the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .
 the real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .
 since tips indexation is based on the total cpi , the tips - consistent measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between cpi inflation and core pce inflation .
 measure description single - equation model
 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
 large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using
 frb / us—
 the staff ’s
 large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
 tips - consistent yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) incorporate investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates .
 the seven - year instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date reflects the short - term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years .
 this forward rate is adjusted down for a term premium , assumed to be 70 basis points , and adjusted up for the difference between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation , projected to be 40 basis points in the medium run .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 14 of 35 assessment would also support retention of the phrase indicating that the removal of policy accommodation can likely proceed at a measured pace .
 investors appear virtually certain that the fomc will increase the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting , and they reportedly put high odds on an announcement that retains both the measured pace language and the assessment that the risks to sustainable growth and to price stability should remain balanced with appropriate policy action .
 thus , the market reaction to an announcement along the lines of alternative b should be relatively modest , although rates could back up a little in response to the changes in the wording suggesting that the fomc was focusing on the strength in spending and inflation pressures .
 barring significant downside surprises in economic data over coming weeks , investors would likely come to boost further the already substantial odds placed on additional policy moves later this year , particularly should public statements by policymakers point to a continuation of firming .",0.25,"-- the proposed announcement for alternative c emphasizes the strength of aggregate spending , suggests that pressures on business costs and inflation could be increasing , and eliminates all forward - looking language .
 if the committee has become significantly more concerned about inflation pressures of late , it may favor the 50-basis - point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c .
 greater worries about inflation prospects could have been prompted by the brisk growth in aggregate demand apparently in train in the current quarter , which could be read as suggesting that asset prices are not exerting sufficient restraint on spending to keep actual output from overshooting its potential before long .
 moreover , members may see the potential for an intensification of cost pressures stemming from a variety of sources .
 the further rise in far - dated oil futures prices over the intermeeting period , for example , suggests that business energy costs will ratchet up somewhat further in coming months .
 also , members may be concerned about the potential for further acceleration in unit labor costs if their assessment of the nairu is noticeably higher than the staff ’s estimate of 5 percent or if they judge that structural productivity growth could be slowing more sharply than estimated by the staff .
 indeed , the slower growth of productivity in recent quarters as well as the lower estimates of productivity implied by the annual revisions to the national income and product accounts might incline policymakers to trim their views of structural productivity even more than has the staff .
 and , even if they had a baseline outlook for the economy and prices similar to that in the greenbook forecast , members may prefer lower inflation than the 2 percent core pce rate projected by the staff for late
 the committee could consider a number of modifications to its statement in conjunction with the selection of alternative c .   for instance , the fomc might wish to delete the reference to “ robust underlying growth in productivity . ”
 although the staff continues to forecast solid growth of structural productivity , the committee ’s confidence on this score may be diminishing and hence it might not wish to class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 19 of 35 characterize the pace of underlying productivity growth so explicitly .
 the statement could highlight the strength of the economy by stating that “ aggregate spending appears to be expanding briskly despite high energy prices . ”
 it could acknowledge recent price developments while registering some concern about inflation prospects by noting that “ core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer- term inflation expectations seem well contained , but pressures on business costs and inflation appear to be increasing . ”   as discussed in the june bluebook , the committee might also take this opportunity to eliminate the forward - looking language from the statement , dropping both the risk assessment and the last two sentences referring to the measured pace of tightening and to the committee
 ’s commitment to respond to economic developments as needed to maintain price stability .
 market participants would no doubt be taken aback by the combination of a 50-basis - point increase in the funds rate at this meeting and the announcement suggested for alternative c .
 investors might infer that policy firming in the current cycle would likely bring the funds rate appreciably above 4¼ percent , the peak funds rate that seems to be currently incorporated in market prices .
 moreover , with the elimination of the measured - pace language , market participants might come to believe that at least some of that rate gap could be covered in additional 50-basis - point strides .
 with the expected policy path pushed sharply upward and little forward- looking guidance provided by the fomc , investors ’ uncertainty regarding the future path of policy would likely increase .
 in all likelihood , the upward revision to policy expectations would trigger a sell - off in fixed - income and equity markets and a rise in the foreign - exchange value of the dollar , although the increase in long - term yields and appreciation of the dollar could be limited if the drop in share prices were especially sharp .
 if the fomc were particularly concerned about inflation pressures but was not prepared to hike rates 50 basis points at this meeting , it could couple a quarter- point move with some of the changes in the statement
 suggested for alternative c . class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 35 such a pairing would temper the surprise to market participants , but it would probably still lead them to mark up significantly their expectations of policy firming .
 money and debt forecasts",0.5,,,0.25
103,2005-09-20,"-- under alternative a , the committee would leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this meeting ; the statement would emphasize hurricane - related uncertainties and suggest that this was just a pause in the tightening process .
-- in contrast , paragraph 16 suggests wording changes to alternative a that would be consistent with an expectation of a more prolonged pause in firming .
-- lastly , the box at the end of this section entitled “ opening up the statement ” examines fundamental changes to the risk assessment that could be made to either alternative a or b.
-- under alternative a , the committee would keep the target federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this meeting and use the statement to explain that it was merely deferring firming in light of the elevated uncertainties , and likely not ending the tightening cycle .
 another possible reason for holding the funds rate unchanged is that a longer pause in policy firming could be appropriate .
 committee members may be concerned that the widespread and severe damage to private property and infrastructure in the gulf region , the extended displacement of a large population , the sharp increase in consumer energy prices , and a potential significant drop in consumer confidence could well exert a more substantial drag on aggregate economic activity than in the staff forecast .
 such a possibility is illustrated in the greenbook ’s “ sentiment slump ” scenario and the scenario based on a pessimistic view of the effects of katrina .
 moreover , while the stance of policy may still be accommodative
 , class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 38 the extent of that accommodation has been reduced significantly by the committee ’s actions through august .
 thus , the committee may feel comfortable awaiting further opening up the statement the “ measured pace ” language , which has been included in the committee ’s statements for the past eleven meetings , has served to signal to market participants that the federal funds rate will be marched up steadily as long as policy accommodation remains in place .
 the committee may believe that this language has now outlived its usefulness for several reasons , independent of this meeting ’s outcome on the stance of policy .
 first , the 2½-percentage - point increase in the nominal federal funds rate since mid-2004 has placed the real federal funds rate near some model - based estimates of its equilibrium ( as shown in chart 5 ) .
 by that arithmetic , some members might be of the view that policy accommodation has been substantially removed and that the committee should halt the process of firming sometime soon .
 second , the devastation in the gulf region probably implies that more uncertainty attends the outlook , and this uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved soon , perhaps increasing the attractiveness of being more gradual in removing policy accommodation .
 third , the possibilities that elevated energy prices , on the one hand , could sap consumer confidence or , on the other , unanchor inflation expectations may require more nimble adjustments to the stance of policy than consistent with the “ measured pace ” language .
 in prior discussions of statement language , some have expressed a preference for providing signals about the future direction of policy only in unusual situations , if at all .
 in that view , guidance about interest rates , which seemed useful when significant disinflation was a risk and at the outset of policy tightening , is no longer useful when the committee is unsure about its actions at the next few meetings .
 the simple expedient , then , would be to drop rows 5 and 6 and any mention of the extent of policy accommodation in table 1 .
 others have argued , however , that providing information about the future direction of the federal funds rate helps the public make better - informed decisions , enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy .
 moreover , simply stating that the committee was not certain whether the next move in rates would be up or down would , on this view , be useful information to market participants .
 ( continued on next page ) class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 23 of 38 information on the effects of hurricane katrina , as well as of the cumulative tightening of policy to date , before resuming policy firming
 —even if that wait could be extended .
 such a view could be conveyed to the public by striking sentence 2 from the draft statement for alternative a .
 the statement could also drop the word “ action ” that now appears in row 5 in order to suggest that appropriate monetary opening up the statement ( cont . )
 one way of regaining flexibility about the range of future action while still providing such information would be to eliminate the “ measured pace ” language from the statement and move from the current practice of basing the risk assessment on appropriate policy to assuming explicitly that the current stance of policy will be kept unchanged for several quarters .
 under such an assumption , the assessments of the probabilities of lower or higher economic growth than is sustainable and of lower or higher inflation , along with an overall risk assessment if needed , can provide guidance about the future direction of policy .
 rows 5 and 6 of table 1 in both columns a and b could be replaced with the following formula : the committee ’s economic outlook is such that , if the federal funds rate were maintained at its current level for the next several quarters , output growth is [ less / as / more ] likely to be above [ as / than ] below its sustainable pace .
 inflation over the same period is [ less / as / more ] likely to increase [ as to / than ] decrease .
 as a result , the committee views the near - term risks to its dual objectives as [ tilted to the downside / balanced / tilted to the upside]. in any event , the committee is prepared to take the steps necessary to maintain price stability and sustainable economic growth .
 if the committee desires to convey the sense that the current stance of policy is unsustainably easy , it could set both toggle switches to their “ more ” setting .
 that is , it would tell the public that , if maintained for the next few quarters , a nominal funds rate of 3½ percent ( under a ) or 3¾ percent ( under b ) would likely foster a pickup in resource utilization and inflation .
 as both measurements would point in the same direction , the overall risk balance sentence could be omitted in this case with no harm to clarity .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 38 policy going forward would not necessarily involve near - term tightening , and refer to “ remaining ” policy accommodation in the first sentence in row 6 . money and debt forecasts",0,"-- under alternative b , the committee would boost the target 25 basis points to 3¾ percent ; the statement would note that the longer - term macroeconomic effects of the hurricane are likely to be limited .
-- ( 10 ) if the committee remains particularly concerned about heightened inflation pressures and sees little chance that hurricane katrina will have lasting and sizable adverse effects on aggregate spending and production , it may wish to tighten policy 25 basis points at this meeting , as under alternative b .
 as shown in table 1 , the proposed announcement associated with alternative b would indicate that “ output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of hurricane katrina . ”
 it would go on to state that , while the hurricane will have adverse short - run economic consequences , including heightened uncertainty and market volatility , the longer - run prospects for the economy are not diminished .
 the statement would note that “ higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures , ” but would also indicate that “ . . .
 core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer - term inflation expectations remain well contained . ”
 it would assert that “ remaining monetary policy accommodation ” and robust underlying growth in productivity continued to support economic activity .
 the rest of the statement would repeat the measured pace language and the assessment that , with appropriate monetary policy action , the risks to growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal .
 at the august meeting , several participants noted that core pce inflation was running at the upper end of the range they considered to be consistent with price stability .
 since then , the staff has marked up its forecast of core inflation for next year about ¼ percentage point , to 2¼ percent .
 moreover , the edging lower of inflation thereafter in the projection owes importantly to the assumed gradual decline in energy prices .
 if the committee saw this inflation outcome as unacceptable or believed that such an expectation was likely to prove optimistic , then it might view the words of alternative b as too timid about the prospects for additional policy tightening .
 such a concern might well be intensified if significant odds were put on the possibility that inflation expectations could become unanchored in response to surging energy prices , perhaps in the manner discussed in the alternative simulation in the greenbook .
 the likelihood of more tightening than currently built into financial market prices could be conveyed to the public by shortening the wording for alternative b that appears in table 1 .
 in particular , the committee could give less weight to the disruptions from hurricane katrina by striking the second and third sentences and dropping the word “ remaining ” in row 3.8
-- as in alternative b , the committee could note the adverse near - term effects of the hurricane on spending , production , and employment , but not include the sentence suggesting that the effects will be temporary .",0.25,,N,,,0.25
104,2005-11-01,"-- under alternative a , the committee would leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 3¾ percent at this meeting ; the statement emphasizes uncertainties surrounding the economic dislocations of the hurricanes and associated effects on consumer and business confidence , but still signals that remaining monetary policy accommodation could likely be removed at a measured pace .
 committee members may wish to consider alternative a if they think that the recent moderate rates of core inflation are likely to continue and if they see the outlook for the economy as especially uncertain because of the effects of the hurricanes and elevated energy prices .
 particularly if the committee , like the staff , views the real federal funds rate as in the vicinity of its equilibrium level , a pause in policy firming might be seen as desirable , partly to await further readings on consumer and business sentiment and spending .
 such a pause may also be chosen if members believe that the real estate market is in the process of softening , which heretofore has been an important spur to household spending .
 under this alternative , the committee might refer to “ remaining ” policy accommodation in the final risk assessment paragraph .
 markets would be surprised at the decision to leave the target funds rate unchanged .
 short - term interest rates would probably decline considerably as markets lowered the probability of near - term tightening moves .
 longer - term interest rates might be little changed or even back up if investors saw the fomc as more tolerant than they expected of an increase in inflation .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall , especially if inflation expectations deteriorated .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 36",0," the committee may wish to begin the rationale portion of the statement for alternative b by reaffirming the view that adverse effects of the hurricanes will probably slow the pace of the expansion only temporarily .
 robust underlying growth in productivity may still be seen as a support for economic activity .
 the statement could also note the boost to aggregate demand from increased private and public spending associated with rebuilding efforts in hurricane - affected areas .
 while a 25 basis point move would place the funds rate at about the midpoint of the staff 's range of estimated equilibrium rates , the committee may still prefer to characterize policy as accommodative in light of the underlying strength of demand and upward pressures on inflation .
 as for inflation , the committee could cite indications , evident in some producer prices and in surveys of near - term inflation expectations , that “
 the cumulative rise in energy and other costs has added to inflation pressures , ” while still noting that “ core inflation has been relatively low in recent months .
 ”   the observation that “ longer - term inflation expectations remain contained ” may be seen as appropriate to convey a balanced view of the inflation outlook .

 futures market quotes suggest that investors are virtually certain of a 25 basis point firming of policy at this meeting , and surveys reveal that primary dealers expect little change in the nature of the statement .
 therefore , market prices would likely be essentially unaffected by a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate and the statement language as under alternative b .",0.25," if the committee wished to convey greater concern about upside risks to inflation , it might prefer to combine a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate with the language included under alternative c .
 the committee may especially favor this alternative if increases in energy and other costs were viewed as beginning to unmoor inflation expectations , potentially starting an upward shift in inflation dynamics that would be hard to reverse later .
 even if inflation expectations remain well anchored for a time , a sharper rebound in spending growth as rebuilding in the hurricane - affected areas picks up steam may put excessive strains on resources .
 the proposed statement drops the characterization of policy as accommodative , but it indicates in the comments on inflation ( row 3 ) that further policy firming likely is necessary on the thought that the committee might soon envision moving the real funds rate past its neutral level — that is , to impose policy restraint .
 the sentence on the balance of risks is also eliminated ; the committee might see that formula as redundant or possibly misleading about the extent of upside inflation risks at present .
 the final paragraph on the measured pace language is also dropped , allowing greater flexibility for possible future adjustments of policy .
 the committee may see this more forceful tone as warranted in light of the backup in market interest rates , increase in inflation compensation , and depreciation of the dollar in recent days , which might be viewed as signs of the emergence of inflation jitters in financial markets .
 indeed , the committee may prefer to raise the target funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting in association with language similar to that under alternative c to underscore its determination to resist an increase in inflation .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 19 of 36 ( 14
 ) market participants would be surprised by the removal of the measured pace and policy accommodation language and , perhaps , by the explicit indication that additional firming was likely to be necessary .
 with a 25 basis point move and the language proposed under alternative c , short - term interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar would likely rise , while stock prices would fall .
 if markets revised down their outlook for longer - term inflation as a result of the statement , however , longer - term interest rates might increase only a little .   with a 50 basis point firming , market participants would likely raise their sense of inflation risks and the near - term path of expected monetary policy substantially ; short- and intermediate - term market interest rates would jump , the dollar would rally , and the stock market could sell off sharply .",0.5,,,0.25
105,2005-12-13,,N," the committee might believe that a 25 basis point firming of policy at this meeting is appropriate for a number of reasons .
 in the staff forecast , output remains near potential , and core inflation , though boosted for a time by the indirect effects of higher energy prices , ends the projection period near 1¾ percent — a level that many members may see as compatible with their price stability objective .
 if the committee believes the greenbook forecast is plausible and acceptable , then it would probably find the 25 basis point policy firming at this meeting assumed in that projection to be attractive .
 put a bit differently , the committee may see the current constellation of class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 14 of 42 asset prices and interest rates in financial markets as likely to be consistent with output running near potential and inflation
 remaining contained .
 if so , then it might want to ratify market expectations of a further 25 basis point tightening at this meeting .
 of course , should the committee ’s outlook have changed significantly since the november meeting , it might wish to select a different setting for its policy instrument than assumed in the alternatives discussed below .
 the committee may favor the statement language of alternative b if it thinks that somewhat higher federal funds rates are likely to prove necessary to limit pressures on resources and promote price stability but also believes that this tightening phase could be ending fairly soon .
 the resilience of the economy in the face of hurricane - related disruptions , already limited margins of slack in resource markets , and the pressures on inflation from elevated energy prices may incline the committee to believe that additional firming will probably be necessary even after a 25 basis point move at this meeting .
 but the committee may be of the view that , with policy accommodation now significantly reduced ,
 the appropriate timing and extent of additional policy firming are becoming more uncertain .
 declines in energy prices and inflation expectations from their recent peaks may have eased members ’ concerns about the inflation outlook .
 and the real federal funds rate ( as measured using lagged inflation to proxy for inflation expectations ) is now within the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value ( chart 5 ) .
 moreover , with a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting , the federal funds rate would be above the range of prescriptions from policy rules based on a target for inflation of 1½ percent ( chart 6 ) , and one more tightening would bring the rate to the top of the range that the rules would call for even in the second half of next year .

 explanatory notes the equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained , would be projected to return output to its potential level over time .
 for the first three measures listed below , the short - run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model ’s projection of the economy .
 for the first two measures , the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .
 the tips - based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead .
 the actual real federal funds rate shown in the chart employs the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .
 measure description single - equation model
 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
 large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using
 frb / us—
 the staff ’s
 large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
 tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .
 the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .
 this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .
 because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium - term difference — projected at 40 basis points
 —between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation .

 the rationale portion of the statement for alternative b notes that the expansion in economic activity appears solid despite elevated energy prices and disruptions related to the hurricanes .
 the reference to policy accommodation has been dropped :   if the federal funds rate is seen as nearing its equilibrium value , the committee may no longer wish to suggest that policy accommodation is boosting growth .
 members may also want to take this opportunity to remove the reference to the support to economic activity provided by robust underlying growth in productivity .
 in assessing inflation , the committee may want to acknowledge the relatively benign core inflation readings in recent months and again indicate that longer - term inflation expectations remain contained .
 however , given the apparent underlying strength of aggregate demand , members may want to note that “ possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures .
 the assessment of risks portion of the statement for alternative b resolves some of the complications and tensions that have arisen in the current language .
 it starts by removing the arguably tautological statement that “ appropriate policy ” should keep the risks to sustainable growth and price stability balanced , and it also drops the indication that “ policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured . ”
 instead , the assessment notes that “ some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to both price stability and sustainable economic growth roughly in balance . ”
 the committee may find this formulation attractive because it simplifies the existing wording considerably but does not greatly change its message regarding the likely near - term path for policy .
 if the committee continues to expect that policy will be adjusted gradually , almost surely in increments of 25 basis points , then the retention of the word “ measured ” would seem appropriate .
 and the use of the word “
 some ” would suggest that the committee expects that the necessary amount of additional tightening is not large .
 given the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 42 considerable uncertainty about the level of the equilibrium federal funds rate , members may no longer be confident that policy is accommodative , and so welcome the deletion of the reference to the removal of policy accommodation here as well as in the rationale section .
 this deletion might seem even more appropriate if members see a possibility that the federal funds rate will need to be raised above its equilibrium value in order to keep inflation contained .
 as in recent announcements , the committee might want to emphasize that policy actions will depend on evolving economic conditions .
 along these lines , the last sentence in the statement notes that “ the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability and foster sustainable economic growth .
-- given the extent of the changes proposed for alternative b , it is difficult to be confident of how the new statement will be interpreted by investors .
 if the committee takes this view , then it might be inclined to retain some of the statement language used at its last meeting .
 such a statement could start by indicating that the economic expansion remains vigorous .
 given the strength seen in underlying aggregate demand and the possible upward pressures on inflation , the statement might continue to characterize the stance of policy as accommodative .
 the inflation discussion could note that “ relatively high levels of resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures . ”   the reference to the relatively high levels of resource utilization , in contrast to the concerns about possible increases in resource utilization expressed in alternative b , would indicate greater concern about pressures on inflation arising from this source and might suggest that monetary policy now would be oriented particularly toward slowing growth in aggregate demand to a pace at or below that of potential output .
 the assessment of risks portion of the statement could again indicate that , with “ appropriate policy , ” the risks to both of the committee ’s dual objectives should be kept roughly balanced and that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace .",0.25,"-- by contrast , alternative c retains much of the form as well as important elements of the content of the november fomc statement , including the characterization of policy as accommodative and the “ measured pace ” language .
 should the committee be particularly concerned about the inflation outlook and still see the stance of policy as accommodative , it may prefer alternative c .
 while energy prices have eased this fall , they remain much higher than a year ago , and other commodity prices have increased as well .
 and although labor costs have generally been well - behaved of late , the committee may believe that labor market slack has been essentially eliminated .
 aggregate demand has proven quite resilient in the face of higher interest rates and hurricane - related disruptions , and it will be boosted further in coming quarters by rebuilding in the gulf region .
 given this apparent momentum to economic activity , members may be concerned about the risk that the short - term equilibrium real federal funds rate could be considerably higher than most of the staff estimates and aggregate demand could significantly overshoot the economy ’s potential .
 moreover , in current circumstances the committee may be concerned that it will need to boost the federal funds rate to a level above its equilibrium if the temporary boost to inflation caused by the run - up in energy and other commodity prices begins to be built into expected inflation along the lines of the “ deteriorating inflation expectations ” alternative greenbook scenario .
 as a result , the committee may believe that it is premature to give a signal that the end of this policy tightening phase is in sight .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 42
 release of the statement for alternative c would lead market participants to boost noticeably their expectations for policy tightening .
 as noted previously , investors appear to have put some odds on the committee dropping or modifying the “ accommodation ” and “ measured pace ” phrases at this meeting as a prelude to winding up this tightening phase .
 moreover , the concerns expressed about the “ relatively high levels of resource utilization ” would come as a surprise to investors .
 regarding near - term expectations , the retention of the “ measured pace ” language could lead investors not only to conclude that a quarter - point move in january was virtually certain but also to mark up appreciably the odds on a policy tightening in march .
 and , beyond that point , the anticipated path for policy would probably class

 money and debt forecasts",0.25,,,0.25
106,2006-01-31," if members see sizable odds that the target funds rate has already been raised sufficiently to check inflationary pressures , the committee would presumably choose to forego a policy move at this meeting , as in alternative a .   with the real funds rate now well within the range of estimates of its equilibrium , it might be desirable to pause at this meeting before deciding whether to move to a position that could entail policy restraint .
 given the lags in the effects of policy changes on the economy and the already substantial cumulative increase in the target funds rate , the committee may prefer to await further data to assess whether additional tightening steps would risk an undesirable overshooting .
 indeed , given the deceleration in economic activity in the fourth quarter and the depressed level of longer - term interest rates , members may believe that the staff forecast is too optimistic about the prospects for continued solid growth .
 moreover , the possibility that the saving rate might rise more rapidly toward historical norms , as discussed in an alternative simulation in the greenbook , may be of sufficient concern to the committee that it would require more evidence of inflationary pressures before firming policy further .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 27 of 42 in addition ,
 if the committee preferred that the core pce inflation rate remain near 2 percent , rather than drop back to 1½ percent , the long - run scenarios discussed earlier would suggest no need to raise the funds rate above 4¼ percent this year .
 the proposed wording of inflation concerns for alternative a , in row 3 of table 1 , is basically a reordering of the sentences employed in the last announcement .
 the phrase regarding elevated energy prices and resource utilization is placed first to leave readers with the sense that such concerns have been somewhat assuaged by recent readings on core inflation and inflation expectations .
 even if members believe that further tightening will likely be needed at some point , they may view those sentiments to be adequately communicated by the asymmetric risk assessment under alterative a.",0.25," although the proposed wording for alternative b suggests greater uncertainty about future policy moves , it continues to indicate that the risks are tilted toward the possibility of further policy firming .
 it would state that “ some further policy firming may well be needed ” to keep risks in balance , replacing “ is likely to ” with “ may well ” in that phrase .
 the proposed wording would also drop the word “ measured , ” as some may believe that the phrase may imply more than one future move .
 the minutes of the december meeting likely helped prepare markets not to interpret the dropping of the word “ measured ” as a signal that the committee expected to move policy in larger increments going forward .
 if the committee wanted to stress the role incoming data will play in its deliberations on further action , it may want to reverse the order of rows 4 and 5 and delete “ in any event .
 ”   the wording in table 1 does not do so on the thought that the committee would prefer to make relatively few changes to the statement at this time .
 some members may be uncomfortable with the language of table 1 either because they believe that further firming will be unnecessary or that the committee should get out of the business of signaling its policy intent .
 in either case , it might be appropriate to strike row 4 and rely on a revised version of row 5 to underscore the uncertainties surrounding policy and the necessity of being responsive to economic data .
 in particular , row 5 could class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 21 of 42 read ,
 “ the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster the attainment of sustainable economic growth and price stability .
 futures markets and surveys suggest that investors are sure of a 25 basis point policy firming at this meeting and place greater than even odds on another such move in march .
 therefore , selection of this policy move coupled with the language of alternative b likely would not result in substantial changes in financial market prices .
 short - term interest rates might edge lower and stocks could rally a bit as market participants strengthen their expectations that the tightening phase may be drawing to a close .
 offsetting this effect somewhat , implied volatilities on options on money market futures may step up as the committee sends a less confident signal about its future action .",0.25," if the committee believes that appreciable further policy firming will likely be needed to address upside risks to inflation―which include the potential pass- through of higher prices of oil and other commodities and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar―it may prefer to associate a ¼ percentage point increase in the target funds rate at this meeting with the language in alternative c .
 a firmer tone might also seem appropriate in light of the longer - run scenarios discussed earlier .
 to achieve a 1½ percent objective for core pce inflation , model - based optimal policy paths , along with several policy rules shown in charts 8 and 9 , point to a need to raise the funds rate above 4½ percent fairly soon.8   even if a target funds rate above 4½ percent needs to be reversed before too long , it might be required to offset near- term pressures on inflation .
 in addition , the moderation in spending growth in the staff forecast depends in part on some cooling of house price appreciation , which is not yet a foregone conclusion , and projecting a more restrictive stance of policy may be appropriate until such a trend is better established .
 8 chart 8 presents two new estimated rules , along with confidence bands reflecting uncertainty about the policy path obtained from model - based simulations of future economic shocks and on options quotes , as discussed in the box .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 42 new analysis of monetary policy rules
 this bluebook introduces two new exhibits related to policy rules .
 first , chart 8 depicts the implications of estimated policy rules , together with information from futures and options prices .
 in the top left panel , the dashed line denotes the path implied by a rule that relates the federal funds rate to its own lagged values , to the current four - quarter average core pce inflation rate , and to the current and lagged output gap ( known as an outcome - based rule because it relies on observed macroeconomic variables ) .
 this empirical specification was chosen using a formal statistical procedure that balances simplicity of the specification with goodness - of - fit over the sample period 1988q1 through 2005q4 .
 dynamic simulation of the frb / us model was then used to determine the predicted funds rate path that this rule implies over the greenbook horizon.1 the chart also depicts the range of uncertainty for the outcome - based rule associated with the incidence of shocks that might occur over the forecast period .
 for that purpose , stochastic simulations of the frb / us model were performed using the estimated distribution of shocks over the post-1987 period to every equation of the model , except the policy rule .
 the dark green region shows the 70 percent confidence interval while the light green region denotes the 90 percent confidence interval .
 the dotted line in the left panel portrays the path prescribed by a forecast - based rule , estimated using greenbook forecasts for the two - quarter - ahead four - quarter - average core pce inflation rate and the one - quarter - ahead and one - quarter lag of the output gap , along with two lags of the funds rate .
 this specification was chosen by a procedure similar to that for the outcome - based rule .
 relative to the outcome - based rule , this rule prescribes a path that is tighter by about ¼ percentage point during 2006 and easier by a similar amount during 2007.2 the right panel of chart 8 provides information from futures and options markets .
 expectations for the federal funds rate derived from quotes on federal funds and eurodollar futures are shown as a dotted line in the right panel .
 the expected funds rate has a mild humped shape over the next two years .
 the confidence bands reflect uncertainty as computed from options prices .
 note that financial markets have built in somewhat less uncertainty than is suggested by the stochastic simulations of the outcome - based rule .
 finally , chart 9 reports on prescriptions from simple policy rules that have been included in bluebooks since january 2004 .   using dynamic simulations of the frb / us model , these rule prescriptions are now shown for the entire greenbook horizon .
 with an inflation objective of 1½ percent , the baseline and aggressive taylor rules prescribe funds rate paths that are lower than the greenbook assumption , whereas the first - difference rule implies a markedly tighter path during 2007 .

 under alternative c , the wording proposed for the inflation outlook , line 3 , would indicate slightly greater concern about the potential for “ increases in resource utilization as well as energy and other cost pressures ” to “ boost underlying inflation .
 ” the assessment of risks could be quite similar to that announced following the december meeting , including a statement that “ some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed ” to maintain balanced risks to price stability and sustainable growth .
 markets would probably see the language under alternative c as indicating a greater probability of future policy tightening than they had expected .

107,2006-05-10,"-- under alternative a , the committee leaves the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting .
 in contrast , the committee may believe that further policy tightening at this meeting is not necessary or desirable and that , at least for now , maintaining the current stance of policy is appropriate , as in alternative a .   as noted previously , the cumulative firming of policy to date has been significant , and the real federal funds rate is now well within the range of model - based estimates of its equilibrium value .
 in these circumstances , the committee may wish to pause to obtain more information that would be useful in assessing whether further action will be necessary .
 put differently , policy accommodation now appears to have been eliminated , and , with core inflation remaining contained — and perhaps believed likely to edge lower over time — despite sharp increases in energy and commodity prices , the committee may not feel a need to move from a roughly neutral posture to a restrictive stance .
 that is the message of the simulation presented earlier :   if the equilibrium real rate is in the neighborhood of 2¾ percent , a 2 percent inflation goal could be achieved by holding the nominal funds rate at 4¾ percent .
 indeed , estimated monetary policy rules imply that the existing stance of policy is about appropriate or even a little firmer than would be predicted by past committee behavior ( chart 8) .
 model simulations using a number of simple policy rules also suggest that further tightening may not be required at this time ( chart 9 ) .

 such an assessment might be importantly influenced by members ’ regional knowledge of the housing situation .
 with national data , particularly survey information , pointing to some cooling , the committee may put some weight on the “ housing slump ” alternative simulation in the greenbook , which suggests that if significant confidence effects accompany a drop in housing values , then considerably easier monetary policy would be warranted .
 both the absence of policy action and the statement associated with alternative a would come as a considerable surprise to market participants .
 short- term market rates would probably drop by about 25 basis points as market participants removed all but a small probability of near - term policy firming .
 the effect on bond yields would depend in part on whether inflation expectations were class

 under alternative b , the rationale paragraph could indicate that spending is likely to slow because of a cooling of the housing market and the restraint imparted by increases in energy prices and interest rates .
 the committee could repeat its analysis in the march statement of recent factors affecting inflation , but then acknowledge that a slight rise in inflation expectations could also add to inflation pressures .
 to treat its dual objectives symmetrically , row 3 includes the committee ’s expectation that core inflation will remain contained , just as there is forward - looking language on economic growth in the previous row .
 in view of the additional quarter - point firming that would be implemented under this alternative , the risk assessment might be softened a little relative to that released after the last meeting by adding “ the committee judges that any additional firming is likely to be modest ” and adopting some of the language of the chairman ’s recent testimony :
 the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information .
 ”   inclusion of the reference to “ timing ” is intended to suggest that additional firming would not necessarily take place at the june meeting .
 if the committee saw only a small probability that it would act again in june , it could tune the message by replacing the second sentence of row 4 with “
 the committee judges that additional firming , if any , is likely to be modest .
 in either case , the dependency class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 19 of 41 of future policy actions on data could be underscored by essentially reiterating the final sentence from the march announcement .
 investors seem sure of a 25 basis point hike in the federal funds rate at this meeting and see only about a one - in - three chance of a similar move in june .
 the statement accompanying alternative b would likely maintain or slightly increase these odds .
 market interest rates could back up a few basis points , and downward pressure on the dollar might be reduced a bit , at least for a time , and equity prices could decline .
-- it could use essentially the same paragraph discussing inflation as that for alternative b , but retain the assertion that “ inflation expectations remain contained ” and emphasize the expectation that core inflation will remain “ well contained . ”   the risk assessment might be revised considerably from that employed at recent meetings .",0.25,"-- under alternative c , the target for the funds rate is raised 50 basis points and the risks are described as balanced without mention of additional policy action .
 the sizable rise over the intermeeting period in long - term nominal interest rates ( which apparently included a significant pickup in compensation for expected inflation   , the weakening of the exchange value of the dollar , and the rise in some survey measures of inflation expectations could be read by members as evidence of an erosion in the public ’s confidence in the committee
 ’s commitment to price stability .
 if so , the combination of a half - point action at this meeting and the words presented in alternative c might be appealing .
 with energy prices having risen sharply further in recent weeks , the committee could be concerned that elevated energy and commodity prices and relatively high levels of resource utilization may begin to leave a more distinct imprint on core inflation and inflation expectations .
 moreover , members may believe that core inflation currently is already at or above the upper end of an acceptable range , inclining them to foster a steeper downward trajectory in inflation than that forecast in the greenbook .
 in that regard , the alternative simulation provided earlier suggests that the nominal federal funds rate would need to reach 5¾ percent by year - end to foster a 1½ percent inflation goal over the next few years .
 the policy action and statement associated with alternative c would catch market participants unawares .
 real bond yields could jump up noticeably ; the rise in nominal yields would be somewhat less if inflation expectations declined — but that would depend on the extent to which investors took the action as an assertion of the committee ’s anti - inflation resolve .
 the recent tendency toward weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be checked , and stock prices would decline .

 the committee may see greater downside risks to economic growth than it did in june .
 among other developments , the incoming information on the housing sector may be viewed as suggesting the possibility of a more prolonged and sizable reduction in residential construction and spending than is currently anticipated by the staff , along the lines of the “ housing slump ” alternative greenbook scenario .
 the incoming data pointing to a slowing in economic growth may also have increased the committee ’s confidence that the recent elevated inflation readings are unlikely to class i
 fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 21 of 39 be sustained .
 keeping the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent for some time would be roughly consistent with an optimal policy path suggested by a simulation of the frb / us model with a long - run inflation objective of 2 percent ( chart 7 ) .
-- in the risk assessment sentence of the announcement , the committee could merely point to the dependence of future policy adjustments on incoming information , as in the assessment proposed for alternative a .",0," although recent rates of inflation , if sustained , would presumably be judged inconsistent with the maintenance of price stability , the committee might see the current stance of policy as likely to be sufficient to put core inflation on a downward track .
 if so , it might be inclined to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at 5¼ percent at this meeting while indicating in the statement that some additional firming might prove necessary , as in alternative b .
 the committee may agree with the staff assessment that core inflation is likely to decline gradually in coming quarters as the forces that have temporarily boosted inflation begin to unwind and the moderation in economic growth fosters an easing of resource pressures .

 fomc statement 1 .
 the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 - 1/4 percent .
 recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year , partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices .
 readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months .
 ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs , and inflation expectations remain contained .
 however , the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures .
 although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time , the committee judges that some inflation risks remain .
 the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth , as implied by incoming information .
 in any event , the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives .

 the current policy stance would be consistent with prescriptions from the estimated forecast - based policy rule ( chart 5 ) as well as the first - difference rule with a long - run inflation objective of 2 percent ( chart 6 ) .
 ( see the box “ intercept shifts in empirical taylor rules . ” )   a pause at this meeting , after seventeen consecutive actions , might be seen as desirable in order to limit the risk of over - tightening and the adverse consequences for employment and growth .
 with the real federal funds rate in the range of model - based estimates of its equilibrium value ( chart 8) , the risk that deferring action for a brief time might significantly worsen underlying inflationary trends would seem to be modest .
 nonetheless , the committee may feel that elevated energy   and commodity prices , possible further increases in these prices , and high levels of resource utilization imply that the upside risks to inflation remain substantial and perceive only limited downside risks to the economic expansion , and so see intercept shifts in empirical policy rules
 chart 5 shows the projections of two empirical policy rules — specified in terms of either outcomes or forecasts of the output gap and core inflation — that have been estimated using quarterly data from 1988q1 to 2005q4 .
 in previous bluebooks , both of these rules involved a time - invariant intercept , essentially implying that the medium - run equilibrium real rate ( r * ) and the implicit inflation objective ( π * ) remained constant throughout the sample period .
 however , recent staff analysis indicates that a significant upward shift in the intercept of each empirical rule occurred in the late 1990s .
 such a shift could arise from either a 75 basis point rise in r * , a 1 percentage point decline in π * , or some combination of the two .
 the funds rate projections and confidence intervals shown in chart 5 incorporate these intercept shifts .
 the projections generated by the forecast - based rule are broadly similar to the expectations of market participants , while the outcome - based rule points to some additional firming .
 reflecting the possibility of an upward shift in the value of r
 * , this bluebook introduces an additional simple policy rule in chart 6 .
 for each specified value of π
 ( either 1½ or 2 percent ) , the new rule follows taylor ( 1999 ) with respect to the policy coefficients — which determine the responsiveness of the funds rate to movements in the output gap and core inflation — but specifies the value of r at 2.75 percent instead of 2 percent .

 explanatory notes the equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained , would be projected to return output to its potential level over time .
 for the first three measures listed below , the short - run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model ’s projection of the economy .
 for the first two measures , the medium - run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter .
 the tips - based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead .
 the actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation , where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate , and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff ’s estimate of the core pce price index and its lagged value four quarters earlier .
 for the current quarter , the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the bluebook publication date .
 measure description single - equation model
 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
 large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using
 frb / us—
 the staff ’s
 large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
 tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .
 the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .
 this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .
 because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium - term difference — projected at 40 basis points
 —between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 39 additional firming as more likely than easing in coming months .
 the committee may find communicating this posture particularly important if it were concerned that inaction at this meeting might lead investors to question its vigilance against inflation .
 under alternative b , the rationale paragraph in the statement would indicate that economic growth has moderated , noting the role of the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices and of the continuing cooling of the housing market .
 while acknowledging the elevated readings on core inflation , it would also cite the reasons to expect inflation to decline in coming quarters : contained inflation expectations , the cumulative effects of past policy firmings , and other factors restraining aggregate demand .
 in its assessment of risks , the committee would reiterate its judgment that some upside inflation risks remain and point to the possibility of additional firming
 should incoming information warrant such action .
 investors see about a one - third chance of a policy firming at this meeting and appear to anticipate a statement similar to that under alternative b .   as a result , the market reaction to implementation of this alternative would likely be fairly small .
 while short - term interest rates would decline somewhat , intermediate- and long - term rates , stock prices , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would change little .",0," the committee may judge instead that an additional 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting , as in alternative c , is needed to bring the risks to the outlook for inflation and economic growth into better balance .
 a firming at this meeting might be appropriate if the staff ’s inflation forecast were seen as likely and generally acceptable but the committee wished to have slightly greater assurance that inflation would diminish in coming quarters .
 members might worry that inflation pressures could turn out to be a little greater than projected in the greenbook .
 the economy has proved quite resilient in the face of higher oil prices and tighter monetary policy over the past two years , and members may see economic growth as most likely to rebound from its sharply slower pace in the second quarter .
 in light of the recent upside surprises in price data , raising the federal funds rate at this meeting class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 39 might also seem desirable as a signal of the committee ’s resolve to foster a decline in inflation .
 even with the firming action under this alternative , the committee may judge that significant upside risks to inflation remain .
 however , some members may see the slowing in the expansion of aggregate demand of late as suggesting that the downside risks to growth have increased since the last meeting .
 the committee might see alternative c as bringing the risks to the attainment of its growth and price stability objectives roughly in balance and believe that , after implementation of such a policy choice , an easing and a tightening of policy are about equally probable .
 with market participants placing less than fifty - fifty odds on a policy move at this meeting , short - term interest rates would likely jump in response to implementation of alternative c .   however , the effect on intermediate - term interest rates would be considerably more muted , and long - term rates could even decline a little should the announcement persuade investors that inflation pressures were less intense than they had appreciated or that the committee was seeking a slightly lower long - term rate of inflation than they had previously perceived .   despite the rise in short - term interest rates , with policy tightening evidently having drawn to a close , class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 23 of 39 equity prices might rally .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar might be little affected .",0.25," if members were dissatisfied with the gradual and limited reduction in inflation in the staff forecast and favored a trajectory of policy that would foster a steeper decline , they might wish to adopt the action and language of alternative
 the optimal policy path simulations of the frb / us model ( chart 7 ) and the first- difference rule ( chart 6 ) , with a long - term inflation objective equal to 1½ percent , would both call for additional firming of policy even following a 25 basis point tightening at the august meeting .
 the committee may also find alternative d attractive if it deems the outlook for employment and growth to be more favorable than the staff projection .
 moreover , members may be concerned that the staff has underestimated the persistence of the forces that have boosted inflation , possible consequences of which are illustrated by the “ persistent inflation ” alternative greenbook scenario .
 indeed , the optimal policy path suggested by a simulation of the frb / us model under perfect foresight in this scenario would call for considerable additional policy firming in coming months .
 however , the policy response would be tempered in the more realistic circumstance that the persistence of the inflationary forces became clear only gradually over time ( see box on next page ) .
 even if the committee saw the staff inflation forecast as the most likely outcome , and one that would be satisfactory , it might find this alternative appealing if it were persuaded by recent price data that the upside risks to inflation , and the potential costs should these risks be realized , continued to predominate despite an additional 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting .
 the potential for further increases in energy prices , for example as a result of mounting geopolitical tensions , could be a reason for such worries .
 while acknowledging the moderation in economic growth and other forces that are expected to contain inflation in coming quarters , the rationale paragraph class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 39 persistent inflation :   implications of alternative policy assumptions
 the policy path implied by a simple rule — such as the empirical outcome - based rule shown in chart 5 and used in analyzing the alternative scenarios in the greenbook— often differs from the optimal policy when policymakers fully understand the forces affecting the real economy and inflation , but may well yield prescriptions close to those under the optimal policy when these forces become evident only gradually .
 for example , the chart below compares these alternative policy assumptions in the context of the greenbook
 ’s ‘ persistent inflation ’ scenario , in which the recent rise in core inflation is much more persistent than in the staff ’s current projection .
 the solid lines depict the optimal policy and associated macroeconomic outcomes ( as deviations from baseline ) when policymakers have perfect foresight about the persistence of the inflation pressures and place equal weight on the objectives of stabilizing inflation , stabilizing unemployment , and avoiding sharp funds rate changes .
 in this case , the optimal policy involves a 75 basis point funds rate hike by the end of 2006 .
 in contrast , if the persistence of the shock does not become apparent until mid-2007 , the optimal policy with gradual learning ( dashed lines ) generates a funds rate trajectory over the next six quarters that lies between the path obtained under perfect foresight and the path associated with the empirical outcome - based rule ( dotted lines ) , in which policy responds to contemporaneous four - quarter average core inflation and to contemporaneous and lagged output gaps .
 all three policy paths generate fairly similar trajectories for inflation , reflecting the relatively sluggish inflation dynamics in the frb / us model .

 the risk assessment could be similar to the committee
 ’s statement in june , indicating that additional firming may be needed , but reference an intention to foster a moderation in inflation pressures .
 the policy choice and announcement of alternative d would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and lead to an upward revision of their outlook for the path of policy .
 short- and intermediate - term interest rates would climb significantly .
 longer - term rates probably would also rise , especially if investors read the statement as suggesting that they should be more concerned about inflation prospects , but the increase would be limited if market participants also revised downward their perceptions of the committee ’s long - term inflation objective .
 equity prices would likely fall , while the foreign exchange value of the dollar might rise .

109,2006-09-20," in contrast , with overall economic activity apparently decelerating further in the current quarter , inflation data for july more favorable than in preceding months , and energy and other commodity prices down notably in recent weeks , the committee may now view the upside risks to inflation as having diminished somewhat and as roughly balanced by the downside risks to economic activity .
 if so , the committee may be attracted to alternative a , under which the stance of policy would be maintained at this meeting and the statement would no longer suggest a predilection to firm policy going forward .
 while moderate economic growth may be viewed as the modal outcome under an unchanged federal funds rate , the downside risks to growth may seem considerable in light of the most recent data pointing to a more pronounced slowing in housing activity , a possibility that is illustrated by the “ housing slump ” scenario in the greenbook .
 moreover , the committee may see the recent decline in the prices of oil and other commodities as potentially signaling a slowdown in global economic growth .
 in any case , with the real federal funds rate at the upper end of the range of model - based estimates of its equilibrium ( chart 7 ) , policy may now be in a stance that is consistent with below - potential economic growth going forward , so that resource pressures are likely to diminish some .

 the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .
 in light of this model ’s simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .
 small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .
 unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .
 large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using
 frb / us—
 the staff ’s
 large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy — depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model ’s exogenous variables .
 these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .
 thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .
 greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .
 rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .
 frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,
 and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .
 the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .
 tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors ’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .
 the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .
 this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .
 because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium - term difference — projected at 40 basis points
 —between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation .

 if so , the committee may not see particularly high odds that policy will need to be tightened further .",0," if the committee deemed it appropriate to keep the funds rate unchanged at this meeting , its key remaining policy decision would seem to be its assessment of the risks to the economic outlook and the associated implications for future action .

 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 15 of 36 might be viewed as appropriate by the committee if it saw high energy and other commodity prices and high levels of resource utilization as implying that the upside risks to inflation remain substantial .
 moreover , recent data on labor compensation and productivity , while not fully congruent with other indicators of labor costs , may also be seen as pointing to potentially substantial inflation risks , as in the “ greater wage pressure ” scenario presented in the greenbook .
 the rationale wording for alternative b could note that the moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing .
 in view of recent information on the residential construction sector , it could indicate that the housing market is cooling , rather than referring to a “ gradual ” cooling as in the august statement .
 the paragraph on inflation could be generally similar to the one in the previous statement .
 however , to acknowledge that the most recent data on core inflation were lower than those in preceding months
 —but not to be seen as overly optimistic in that regard—
 the statement could indicate that core inflation readings have been elevated “ on balance ” over recent months .
 the committee might also wish to explain more explicitly its expectation that inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time by citing a reduced impetus from energy prices .
 judging from current financial quotes , market participants do not view maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent for some time as an approach the fomc would select to balance competing macroeconomic risks .
 even though the committee identified upside risks as its predominant concern in the august class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 16 of 36 statement , money market futures prices suggest the anticipation of ½ percentage point of policy easing next year , an expectation that imparts financial stimulus to the extent that it has been incorporated in other asset values .
 if that stimulus is seen as excessive , the committee could use the statement as a means to make plainer its assessment that the policy rate is more likely to rise than to fall .
 in particular , the committee could strike the reassuring phrase “ on balance ” about recent inflation readings in row 2 of alternative b and add an explicit characterization of the odds of future action in row 4 .   for example , after explaining that inflation risks remain , the committee could add that “ . . . policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward .",0," if the fomc expected stronger growth or higher inflation than the staff , or if it saw the greenbook forecast as credible but was unhappy with the forecast path for inflation , it might wish to take another firming step at this meeting , as in alternative c .
 the committee ’s concerns about the inflation outlook may have been exacerbated by recent compensation and productivity data .
 moreover , in the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 36 staff projection , core pce inflation is projected to remain a bit above 2 percent until late 2008—an outcome that would mark five consecutive years of elevated core inflation relative to the objectives cited by a number of members of the committee .
 overall inflation likewise is forecast to remain relatively high until 2008 .
 given this forecast , members may believe that acceptable progress toward price stability will likely involve a somewhat firmer stance of monetary policy over coming quarters than assumed by the staff .
 even if the committee found the rate of decline in inflation forecast in the greenbook to be generally acceptable , it might wish to firm policy another step at this meeting to provide more assurance that inflation was headed down .
 an announcement associated with alternative c could , as in the august statement , indicate that growth “ has moderated ” and , as in the other alternatives , drop the word “ gradual ” in characterizing the cooling of the housing market .
 the first sentence in the inflation paragraph could also be similar to the one in the august statement , but it might include the phrase “ on balance ” to acknowledge implicitly the lower inflation figures published for july .
 rather than repeat the expectation that inflation pressures would moderate , the committee could state that it took the firming action to foster a decline in inflation .
 the committee might also want to indicate that , despite the firming step , it continued to be concerned with inflation risks , as it was in august , and again reference the possibility of additional firming .
 if , by contrast , the committee saw such a step as a final “ insurance ” move against inflation , the risk assessment section could take a neutral position and simply indicate that future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook , thereby suggesting that the committee no longer had a predisposition to firm policy .
 the tightening of policy and the statement shown under alternative c of table 1 would come as a considerable surprise to market participants .
 investors would likely conclude that at least one more policy firming action was in store after class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 21 of 36 the action at this meeting .
 nominal money market rates and shorter - term coupon yields would rise sharply .
 real rates further out the curve could also increase , but nominal long - term yields could decline if market participants concluded that the fomc was seeking a steeper decline and had a lower ultimate objective for inflation than they had previously perceived .   with real rates higher , the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise , and equity prices would probably decline .
 however , if the committee instead opted to remove the reference to future firming and to suggest that it saw the risks as balanced after the move , these market responses would likely be muted considerably .
 money and debt forecasts",0.25,,,0.0
110,2006-12-12," if the data released over the intermeeting period have caused members to revise their assessment of the distribution of possible outcomes for inflation and economic growth such that the risks are now thought to be more balanced , the committee may prefer the policy choice and wording of alternative a .
 the sharper adjustment in residential investment implied by the incoming data , combined with the continuing high level of inventories in the auto sector and the softer tone of recent spending and production indicators more generally , might be seen as increasing the downside risks to economic growth .
 members may also see some possibility that the recent easing of financial conditions , and the associated stimulus to economic growth , could be short lived , as illustrated in the “ tighter financial conditions ” scenario presented in the greenbook .
 moreover , the staff ’s projection of relatively sluggish near - term expansion might cause the committee to worry that such downside risks , if they materialized , could lead to a disproportionate slowdown in growth .
 at the same time , the committee ’s confidence that core inflation will decline may have been boosted by the improvement in some measures of core inflation , the downward revisions to data on increases in hourly compensation and unit labor costs earlier this year , and the absence so far of substantial renewed upward pressure on oil prices .
 the committee may also place some weight on the possibility that inflation could slow more quickly than in the staff forecast , either because the general persistence of inflation may have declined over the past decade or because the recent pickup in core inflation was associated importantly with increases in shelter costs , which might fall back relatively sharply if the ongoing adjustment of the housing market leads to a marked increase in the supply of rental accommodation .
 finally , as noted earlier , maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent over the next few quarters would be class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 18 of 40 broadly consistent with the committee ’s past behavior as captured in the estimated policy rules .
 to acknowledge the downside risks to growth , the statement accompanying alternative a would note that the ongoing adjustment of the housing market could have a “ more pronounced effect on growth in coming quarters than anticipated .
 ” the committee may also wish to recognize the slight decline in some measures of core inflation in recent months by noting that “ readings on core inflation have improved modestly since the spring . ”
 even so , the statement would stress that readings on core inflation “ remain elevated .
 ”   given the competing risks to inflation and growth , the risk assessment would simply note that “ in these circumstances , future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth , as implied by incoming information .",0,"-- a would imply that the risks to economic growth and inflation were now judged to be broadly balanced , whereas alternative b would again indicate that the risks to inflation remained of greatest concern .
 in light of the recent data and the revision to the staff ’s projection for near- term growth , the committee may wish to make two changes to the discussion of economic growth in the policy statement accompanying alternative b .   first , the extent of the decline in housing activity in recent quarters means that it may now be more appropriate to refer to the cooling of the housing market as “ substantial .
 second , the statement could acknowledge that “ the recent pace of growth appears to have been somewhat more subdued than anticipated … ”   even so , the committee could note that “ the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters . ”   the inclusion of the phrase “ on balance ” allows for the possibility that measured gdp growth in the current and subsequent quarter may be notably below trend before rebounding thereafter .
 with the prospects for inflation largely unchanged , there appears to be little reason to alter the inflation paragraph from that in the october statement .
 likewise , the statement could conclude by repeating the risk assessment from the previous statement .
 an announcement along the lines of alternative b is unlikely to prompt a significant market reaction .
 money market futures and options indicate that investors assign essentially no probability to a change in the target rate at the december meeting .
 and the desk ’s survey indicates that the majority of primary dealers expect that the accompanying statement will not differ significantly from the october announcement apart from some modest updating of the paragraph characterizing economic growth , though a minority anticipate language that points to some class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 17 of 40 downside risks to the growth outlook while still citing upside risks to inflation .
 although the statement proposed for alternative b does not explicitly recognize risks to growth , it seems consistent with the broad thrust of these expectations .",0,"-- under alternative c , the committee would increase the target rate 25 basis points at this meeting and continue to emphasize the presence of upside risks to inflation .
 in contrast , the committee may now see it as unlikely that inflation will decline at an acceptable pace should the current stance of policy be maintained and hence judge it necessary to take further policy action , as in the 25 basis point firming of alternative c .   in particular , members may believe that the tightness in labor markets means that inflation may fail to decline , and could even rise , as illustrated in the “ greater wage acceleration ” scenario presented in the greenbook .
 in addition , class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 19 of 40
 the recent easing of financial conditions could impart significant stimulus to aggregate demand , augmenting pressure on resources .
 also , some members may judge that long - term inflation expectations are higher than would be consistent with an appreciable decline in inflation from recent rates and that monetary policy needs to tighten to help foster a reduction in these expectations .
 even if members think that the staff ’s forecast for core inflation to edge gradually lower is reasonable , they may consider the extent and pace of that expected decline , in which core pce inflation is projected to remain above 2 percent through 2008 , to be unacceptable , and hence see further policy firming as necessary .
 in the medium - term strategies presented earlier , the optimal policy path associated with an inflation objective of 1½ percent involves raising the federal funds rate to about 6 percent over the next year .
 the firming of the stance of policy envisaged under alternative c and the accompanying statement would come as a considerable surprise to the markets .
 investors would likely revise up sharply their expectations for the path of policy over class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 40 the next year or so .
 short- and intermediate - term nominal and real yields would rise markedly .
 longer - term nominal yields would likely rise by less or could even fall if investors concluded that the fomc had a lower objective for inflation than they had previously thought .
 with real rates higher , the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise , and equity prices would decline .
 money and debt forecasts",0.25,,,0.0
111,2007-05-09,"-- under alternative a , the committee lowers the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent .
 even if the committee views the staff ’s central outlook as broadly plausible and desirable , members may judge that the risk of persistently weaker economic growth is unacceptably large .
 if so , the committee might wish to reduce the chance of a more pronounced economic slowdown by easing policy 25 basis points as in alternative a .   the recent disappointing data on home sales and inventories of new homes for sale may heighten concern that the extent of the ongoing adjustment in the housing market and associated spillovers to household and business spending could be greater than currently anticipated .
 moreover , members might worry that the economic fundamentals supporting the expansion going forward could be less robust than envisaged by the staff .
 in particular , the recent weakness in business spending may indicate that firms have grown less optimistic about future returns , which could continue to weigh on investment plans in coming quarters .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 18 of 36 relative pessimism could also conceivably color firms ’ hiring decisions
 —especially if the recent strength of employment is a lagging phenomenon reflecting labor hoarding — and so damp prospects for households ’ income and consumption .
 and financial conditions might turn less favorable ; in particular , long rates may move significantly higher if monetary policy is not eased as expected , and equity prices could fall short of the greenbook projection if corporate earnings slow as anticipated by the staff .
 the possibility that the fundamentals supporting the economic expansion might prove to be weaker than expected is explored in the greenbook alternative simulation “ business caution with financial spillovers .
 the rationale for alternative a would note that , although the economy seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace , the weakness in housing and capital spending implies a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than anticipated .
 given the moderation in inflation in march , the committee might wish to switch the ordering of the clauses in the second sentence of the inflation paragraph to suggest a slightly more benign outlook for inflation .
 even so , with opposing risks to activity and inflation , the statement would indicate that the committee has no clear predilection concerning the likely future direction of policy and that policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook .",-0.25," in march , members apparently judged that maintaining the current target federal funds rate provided the best chance of fostering moderate economic growth and a gradual ebbing in core inflation .
 the incoming data over the intermeeting period have not altered significantly the staff ’s assessment of the prospects for growth and inflation .
 if the committee similarly has not substantially changed its assessment of the economic outlook , it may be attracted to alternative b , under which the federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent and the statement continues to highlight concern about inflation .
 indeed , members may believe that both the upside and downside risks associated with maintaining the current target rate have diminished somewhat , given that the turmoil in the subprime market does not appear to have spread to the rest of the mortgage market or to have led to a more general retrenchment in financial markets and that readings on core inflation in march were more favorable .
 in the staff ’s analysis , the real federal funds rate is close to the greenbook - consistent measure of its equilibrium value , suggesting that the current stance of policy , if maintained , is likely to return output to a more sustainable level over time .
 while members may harbor concerns about the glacial pace of the projected moderation in core inflation , they may nevertheless prefer a patient class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 17 of 36 approach rather than incur the risks associated with fostering a more rapid disinflation in an environment of soft economic growth .
 in such circumstances , the committee might wish to be particularly clear that its patience does not represent a down- weighting of its long - run inflation objective .
 the statement accompanying alternative b could acknowledge that economic growth slowed in the first part of the year , but indicate that the economy still seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters .
 the statement would reiterate the risks to inflation posed by the high level of resource utilization and conclude , as in march , that the committee ’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected .
 investors see virtually no chance of a policy change at this meeting .
 likewise , given the revisions to the language in the statement in march , the desk ’s survey suggests that most primary dealers do not expect substantive changes to the statement .
 thus , implementing alternative b is likely to provoke little market reaction .",0,"-- under alternative c , the committee tightens by 25 basis points , bringing the target rate to 5½ percent .
 in contrast , members might be concerned that inflation will not moderate as the staff expects , and that the costs of inflation persisting at elevated levels for a prolonged period could be substantial .
 if so , the committee might prefer to foster a more decisive slowing in inflation by tightening 25 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative c .
 price pressures might not yet be viewed as convincingly on a downward trend , and the softening in the dollar and increases in energy and other commodity prices since the march meeting may have heightened the committee ’s concerns about the inflation outlook .
 moreover , with the staff forecast suggesting that the pace of moderation in core inflation might be even slower than previously anticipated , members may perceive an increasing risk that long - run inflation expectations might drift up , as illustrated by the greenbook alternative scenario “ unanchored inflation expectations .
 the statement accompanying alternative c could reiterate the committee
 ’s judgment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace .
 the committee ’s concern about the prospects for inflation could be stressed by noting that “ considerable uncertainty ” surrounds the judgment that inflation is likely to moderate .
 the sources of upside risk to inflation could be broadened to include reference to the recent increases in energy and other commodity prices .
 the statement could conclude by noting that , even after the policy tightening , the committee ’s predominant concern remains the upside risks to inflation .",0.25,,,0.0
112,2007-08-07," the committee might instead view recent data and developments as indicating that the balance of risks has shifted enough to warrant cutting the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points , as in alternative a .
 the housing market appears to be weakening further , indicators of private spending outside of the housing sector have been mixed of late , and credit spreads have widened — perhaps suggesting that downside risks to growth have increased .
 moreover , members might be concerned that recent financial strains could intensify , further reducing the availability of credit to households and businesses and weakening consumer and investment spending , as in the “ greater housing correction with spillovers to confidence and financial markets ” scenario in the greenbook .
 at the same time , recent subdued readings on core inflation may have increased the committee ’s confidence that inflation pressures are gradually ebbing .
 furthermore , with growth in labor compensation remaining moderate , the committee might think that the equilibrium unemployment rate could be lower than currently estimated by the staff , as in the “ lower nairu ” greenbook alternative scenario , suggesting that core inflation could decline a bit more than in the staff forecast .
 in these circumstances , the committee may judge that a slightly lower federal funds rate would more appropriately balance the increased risk of sluggish economic growth against the reduced upside risk to inflation .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 23 of 43
 the draft statement in alternative a continues to note that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace , but it also explicitly recognizes that greater weakness in the housing sector and the diminished availability and higher cost of credit to riskier borrowers have raised the odds that the economy will grow less than expected .
 in the inflation paragraph , the draft language not only indicates that core inflation has been subdued in recent months , it also states that core inflation “ is expected to be moderate over coming quarters ” rather than repeating the view that “ a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated . ” but the statement would continue to indicate that the high level of resource utilization poses an upside risk to inflation .
 the statement could conclude by noting that , after the 25 basis point easing , the committee views the downside risk to growth as roughly balanced by the upside risk to inflation .
 such an assessment would imply that the committee does not see the easing as likely to be the first of a sequence of moves .",-0.25," if the committee continues to view the current stance of policy as likely to foster sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation , then it may wish to choose alternative b , under which its target for the federal funds rate would remain at 5¼ percent for the time being .
 the real federal funds rate is close to its greenbook - consistent equilibrium value ( chart 5 ) , supporting a view that the current stance of policy is likely to promote a gradual easing of pressures on resources .
 additionally , the current target for the funds rate remains close to prescriptions for near - term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation goal ( chart 6 ) and some of the policy rules shown in chart 7 .
 the committee might agree with the staff ’s assessment that recent developments in financial markets are unlikely to impose substantial restraint on aggregate demand , given that credit remains readily available to most households and businesses .
 the committee might also agree with the staff ’s view that , after a relatively brief interruption as the markets reassess credit risk , normal flows of credit probably will resume , though with risk spreads above the unusually low levels seen in the past few years .
 even if the committee is class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 21 of 43 less sanguine than the staff
 , members might decide that more concrete information about the economic effect of less readily available credit would be needed to warrant a change in the stance of monetary policy .
 moreover , the committee might judge that maintaining its current policy stance would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks to its dual objectives :   on the one hand , weakness in housing and strains in credit markets could have a more pronounced effect on overall economic activity than foreseen in the staff forecast ; on the other , the moderation in inflation may not be sustained .
 the draft statement for alternative b reiterates the view that the economy is likely to continue expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters .
 however , by citing tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses , it also suggests somewhat greater downside risk to growth .
 the draft acknowledges recent favorable readings on core inflation , characterizing them as “ relatively subdued . ”   at the same time , it points to continued upside inflation risk by repeating language from the june statement that “ a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated ” and that “ the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures . ”
 even if members judge that downside risks to growth have increased in recent weeks and that upside risks to inflation have diminished , they may still see the risks as unbalanced and thus want to indicate that the committee ’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected .
 taken as a whole , the language in alternative b is slightly softer than the june statement , but it also suggests that the committee does not expect the less accommodative conditions in credit markets to have a significant adverse effect on the economic expansion .
 market participants see substantial odds of an easing of monetary policy in coming months but little chance of a rate cut at this meeting .
 in responding to the desk ’s survey , most primary dealers said they expect no more than minor class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 43 modifications to the text of the accompanying statement , although one - third indicated they expect the committee to mention deteriorating financial conditions .
 alternative
 b seems generally consistent with those expectations , so a sizable market reaction to a statement such as that suggested in alternative b appears unlikely .
 but markets might interpret the reference to tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses as a first step toward a possible easing , in which case the perceived probability of a rate cut in september would increase .",0," although recent readings on core inflation have been subdued , overall inflation has been elevated , boosted by increases in the prices of oil and other commodities .
 members may be concerned that high headline inflation might soon begin to boost inflation expectations , augmenting the upward pressure on core inflation that is already emanating from the pass - through effects of higher energy and commodity prices and perhaps from relatively tight labor and product markets .
 if so , the committee might prefer to raise the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative c .   even under the baseline outlook , the optimal policy path shown in chart 6 indicates that policy would need to be tightened about 1 percentage point class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 25 of 43 over the next year
 should the committee wish to bring core inflation down to 1½ percent .
 moreover , members might interpret the fairly strong rebound in second- quarter real gdp growth and the solid job gains seen through the spring as indications that there could be greater strength in aggregate demand going forward than suggested in the staff forecast .
 another possible reason for expecting greater strength in aggregate demand is that the nipa revisions revealed that the personal saving rate has been higher than previously estimated , perhaps suggesting , as in the “ flat saving rate ” alternative in the greenbook , that households feel less need to restrain growth in spending than envisioned in the staff forecast .
 if members expect stronger growth in aggregate demand than projected in the greenbook , they may be concerned that pressures on resource utilization will intensify — especially if they share the staff ’s view that the revised gdp data indicate that trend productivity growth and the economy ’s sustainable growth rate are lower than previously estimated .
 the statement accompanying alternative c could reiterate the assessment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace , but reorder the clauses to underscore the view that the adjustment in the housing sector appears unlikely to derail the economic expansion .
 it could also point to the rebound in growth in the second quarter rather than to moderate growth in the first half .
 the inflation paragraph could note the subdued readings on core inflation in recent months but repeat june
 ’s message that a few months of good inflation news does not convincingly demonstrate a sustained moderation in inflation pressures .
 the statement could also point to the elevated level of overall inflation , in effect providing an additional rationale for the committee ’s policy decision .
 the statement could conclude by noting that , even after the increase in the funds rate , the committee ’s predominant policy concern remains the upside risk to inflation .",0.25,,,0.0
113,2007-09-18," if members are particularly pessimistic about the growth outlook , or see the downside risks as especially large , then they may prefer to both ease 50 basis points and explicitly point to downside risks in order to maximize the scope for further near - term policy action , as envisioned in alternative a .
 members might view the current configuration of asset prices and credit spreads as possibly presaging a sharp slowdown in growth or even a recession .
 ( see box “ financial indicators of recession risk . ” )
 the committee may be concerned that the housing correction could be more severe than anticipated by the staff , as explored in the “ greater housing correction ” alternative simulation in the greenbook .
 members may also worry that a serious credit crunch could be emerging with economic consequences of the sort explored in the greenbook “ bank capital crunch ” scenario .
 if asset - backed commercial paper programs draw even more heavily on bank backup liquidity lines and banks come to hold a large volume of leveraged loans and mortgages on their balance sheets , banks may tighten terms and standards for lending to households and businesses in order to conserve liquidity and balance sheet capacity .
 continued market volatility or the emergence of news of losses could lead to solvency concerns about one or more major market participants , which would likely worsen counterparty credit concerns and interbank funding problems .
 the committee may consider these class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 27 of 49 financial indicators of recession risk some financial market observers consider the slope of the treasury yield curve to be a useful predictor of future macroeconomic conditions .
 the yield curve had been inverted or flat until june and recently has steepened somewhat ; thus , by that measure , the risk of recession appears to have diminished in recent months .
 however , spreads between corporate yields and comparable - maturity treasury yields also have had considerable statistical power in predicting recent recessions .
 some of those credit spreads have surged over the past month to levels comparable to those reached in 1989 and 2000 .
 thus , markets may be signaling high odds of imminent macroeconomic deterioration , despite the steepening of the treasury yield curve .
 combining term and credit spreads in a logistic regression produces a model that performs well in “ predicting ” the last two recessions one year ahead while at the same time minimizing the number of false positives — that is , predictions of recessions that did not occur .
 different measures of term and credit spreads produce slightly different results in this model , but a good fit is achieved — over the 1988 through 2006 estimation period
 by using the spread on aa - rated five - year corporate bonds and the difference between ten- and two - year treasury
 the august 2007 average values of these variables suggest a probability of about 40 percent that the u.s . economy will be in a recession in august 2008 .
 this is the largest probability that the model has produced since late 2000 , and it is up from virtually zero earlier in the year .
 if spreads during the first part of september were to persist for the remainder of the month , the estimated probability would rise to over 80 percent .
 the apparently heightened risk of recession is notable , but some caveats are in order .
 in particular , given the rather unprecedented nature of recent developments , it is possible that the term and credit spreads currently reflect different factors than they did prior to the previous two recessions .
 moreover , the aa spread has risen more dramatically than some other credit spreads in recent weeks .
 for example , high - yield bond spreads remained near their historical averages and thus continued to suggest less than 10 percent odds of a recession as of august .
 although high - yield spreads have not previously performed as well in predicting business cycles as aa spreads , the sensitivity of the prediction to which credit spread is used indicates that the recent readings should be interpreted with care .
 1 specifically , these two variables forecast recent recessions and expansions at least as well as alternative measures of term and credit spreads , based on both in- and out - of - sample tests .

-- second , alternative a states that credit conditions and the housing correction “ appear likely to exert appreciable restraint ” on growth , which is stronger than the statement that they have “ the potential   . . .
-- ( 25 ) a 50 basis point rate cut and the adoption of the statement language in alternative a would cause short - term interest rates to decline appreciably , as investors would be somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the policy action and would also infer that policy probably would be eased further .",-0.5," financial conditions have deteriorated sharply on balance since the august 7 fomc meeting , making it more difficult and costly for households to class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 49 obtain nonconforming mortgages and also leading to tighter credit conditions for some firms .
 in addition , some nonfinancial indicators , including the august employment report , pending home sales , and anecdotal reports from contacts in private industry , suggest a weaker near - term outlook .
 in view of these developments , the committee may judge that prospects for economic activity have deteriorated notably , and that the risk of a substantial and protracted slowdown in economic growth is now unacceptably large .   with such an outlook , and with inflation data continuing to be benign , members might see it as appropriate to counter the effect of tighter financial conditions by easing policy by 50 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative b .   if members judge that evolving circumstances will likely warrant easing policy by 50 basis points or more over the next several months , as in the staff forecast , then they might think it prudent to implement a half - percentage - point cut at this meeting .
 the real federal funds rate is now about 50 basis points above its greenbook - consistent equilibrium value ( chart 5 ) and is also above the range of model - based equilibrium estimates , suggesting that a half - point easing in policy is unlikely to lead to unacceptable pressures on resources .
 a 50 basis point rate cut is also consistent with the prescriptions of a number of simple policy rules , even with a 1½ percent inflation objective ( chart 7 ) .
 a relatively aggressive easing of policy might also be viewed as valuable insurance against the risk of a further slide in investor and consumer confidence or a possible further deterioration in financial market conditions .
 should such fears ultimately prove to be unfounded , and financial markets and the outlook for the economy improve , the committee might believe that it could act quickly to take back some or all of the easing .
 the draft language of alternative b repeats the observation from the august 7 fomc statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of the year .
 however , it drops the assessment from the august 17 statement that “ recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace ,
 ” class i
 fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 25 of 49 as information that has subsequently become available suggests greater weakness in activity .
 it then adapts language from the august 17 statement to note the potential dampening effect of financial market turmoil on the housing market and the growth outlook more generally .
 the statement observes that the rate cut is intended to forestall the effects of these developments on the economy and to promote moderate growth “ over time . ”
 this wording leaves open the possibility that growth may be weak for a time but suggests that the longer - term outlook remains healthy .
 although this sentence does not literally express any asymmetry , analysts are likely to read the statement overall as indicating some predelication to ease policy further .
 this approach could be seen as giving the committee flexibility going forward , either to ease further in response to soft incoming data or to stand pat if the economy appears to be stabilizing .
 if members find alternative b attractive , but wish to adopt an explicit statement of balanced risks , then they might insert the sentence “ after today ’s action , the committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation ” at the start of the assessment of risk paragraph .
 measuring market expectations is especially challenging in the current environment , but investors appear to place substantial odds on two possible target rate decisions at this meeting―a quarter - point cut and a half - point cut―and seem to envision cumulative easing of 75 to 100 basis points by the end of this year .
 with alternative b putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some possibility of further rate cuts , this alternative would likely prompt a modest decline in short - term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might edge lower .
 however , intermediate - term interest rates would probably change relatively class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 26 of 49 little .
 the effect on equity , credit , and term funding markets would depend on how investors interpreted the decision .
 they would most likely conclude that the sizable policy response may offset some of the macroeconomic effects of credit market turmoil , leading equity prices to rally and risk spreads to narrow .
 but it is possible that the relatively large policy move and the statement could lead investors to infer that the growth outlook is weaker than they had previously thought , having the opposite effect .
 going forward , the reference to the committee closely following timely indicators may sharpen the sensitivity of markets to near - term and forward- looking economic data .
-- a is similar to that for alternative b , but with four main differences .
-- as with alternative b , the effect on equity , credit and term funding markets is ambiguous , but the negative growth outlook in this alternative might well spook investors and cause stock prices to fall and risk spreads to rise .",-0.5,"-- under alternative c , the policy rate would be lowered 25 basis points to 5 percent , and the statement would indicate that the downside risks to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation .
 the greenbook forecast is predicated on an assumption of a quarter - point easing in policy at this meeting and a second easing at the october meeting .
 if the committee finds the staff forecast to be both plausible and likely to be the best attainable outcome under the current difficult circumstances , then it may choose to ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement pointing to downside risks to the outlook , as in alternative c .
 members may judge that the growth class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 29 of 49 outlook has deteriorated , but might not be convinced that the downside risks are sufficient to justify a 50 basis point easing at this meeting .
 also , they may be unsure of the magnitude of the macroeconomic fallout from recent financial turmoil , and prefer to await more information before responding further .
 indeed , they may think that financial market conditions could improve quickly , along the lines of the “ faster rebound ” greenbook alternative simulation .
 that view may be reinforced by the general resilience of equity prices in the face of credit market disruptions , a pattern that does not seem consistent with a serious financial crisis being underway .
 members may also be concerned that a half - point easing in monetary policy at this time would be misconstrued by some investors as a sign that the committee was responding directly to asset prices , potentially exacerbating moral hazard by encouraging excessive risk taking among market participants in the future .
 moreover , some members may be concerned that investors could perceive a half - point easing at this meeting as signaling a downweighting of the committee
 ’s price stability objective .
 if so , they may prefer to implement a more modest cut in rates at this time while expressing the judgment that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation , even after the policy easing .
 members may find this option especially attractive if they are concerned about the speed with which the committee could reverse a larger rate cut should financial markets stabilize sooner than currently expected .
 a quarter - point easing in policy at this meeting is also in line with the prescription from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation goal ( chart 6 ) .
 with investors placing considerable weight on a 50 basis point cut at this meeting , the adoption of alternative c would probably cause short - term interest rates to rise somewhat , even though the downside balance of risks would suggest that class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr   page 30 of 49 further easing could well be forthcoming .
 the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely appreciate modestly .
 with the federal reserve perhaps perceived as inclined to respond only gradually to the evolving circumstances―an impression that might be amplified by the committtee ’s assessment that the risks are tilted to the downside―investors might mark down their outlook for economic growth , leading long - term yields and equity prices to fall and spreads in credit markets to widen somewhat .",-0.25,"-- in contrast , alternative d recognizes the deterioration in financial conditions but repeats the judgment that moderate growth is likely over coming quarters .
-- in alternative d , the inflation assessment is unchanged from the august 7 statement .
 members may be especially concerned about the dangers of overreacting to financial market developments and may not be convinced that the recent credit market turmoil will persist or have large macroeconomic implications .
 and , with the unemployment rate unchanged since the august fomc meeting , productivity having decelerated considerably , core pce inflation still close to 2 percent , and crude oil prices surging to record levels , some members may continue to be quite concerned about the inflation outlook .
 if so , they may prefer to leave policy unchanged at this meeting .
 an unchanged stance of policy , coupled with an assessment that the risks have moved into balance , as envisioned in alternative d , would allow the committee more time to gauge the need for policy adjustments while leaving the flexibility for policy to be eased at the next meeting , if such a move appears necessary at that time .
 members may be particularly attracted to this alternative if they see a risk that a premature easing of policy could cause long - run inflation expectations to drift upwards .
 indeed , optimal policy simulations with a 1½ percent inflation goal ( chart 6 ) suggest that policy should actually be tightened further at some point this year .
 the draft statement accompanying alternative d retains the observation that economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year .
 it adopts language from the august 17 statement about recent financial developments and notes that such developments have the potential to restrain growth , but indicates that weakness in residential investment is likely to be offset by solid growth in other class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 31 of 49 sectors of the economy and concludes that the economy is nonetheless likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace .
 the inflation paragraph is barely changed from the august 7 statement , and the reference to pressures on resources is retained , suggesting that nothing has changed to diminish concerns about inflation .
 given the potential for financial developments to restrain growth and the essentially unchanged inflation picture , the committee would conclude that the risks to growth and inflation are now roughly balanced .
 although investors do not completely rule out an unchanged target funds rate at this meeting , the adoption of alternative d would come as a considerable surprise .
 short - term interest rates would surely rise , and it is likely that equity prices would fall substantially and the treasury yield curve would flatten , particularly if market participants marked up the odds of slow growth or a recession in light of the decision to leave policy unchanged . money and debt forecasts",0.0,-0.5
114,2007-12-11," if the committee views the renewed deterioration in financial markets and the sharper contraction in the housing sector as presenting a particularly severe threat to the economic expansion , it might want to lower the target funds rate 50 basis points , as in alternative a .   a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate would put the real funds rate close to the greenbook - consistent measure of its equilibrium value ( chart 5   and thus , under the baseline projection , would be consistent with output returning to its potential in the medium term .
 a reduction of this size would also be broadly compatible with the optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation objective ( chart 6 ) and some of the simple policy rules with that goal ( chart 7 ) .
 moreover , given the deterioration in term funding markets and increased concerns about balance sheet capacity and counterparty credit risk , the committee might worry about the potential for substantial additional tightening of banks ’ lending terms and standards , particularly if it viewed the arrangement of swap lines with foreign central banks and implementation of a term auction facility as unlikely to provide significant relief to funding markets .
 members might also see incoming evidence of a deepening contraction in the housing sector , as well as the apparent softening in business and consumer spending , as presenting unacceptably large downside risks to overall economic activity .
 by contrast , incoming core inflation data have continued to be moderate , and the committee may see the inflation outlook , and the associated risks , as essentially unchanged .
 in these circumstances , members might conclude that the weaker modal outlook for growth and significantly class
 fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 24 of 43 increased downside risks warrant a 50 basis point policy move at this meeting .
 members may believe that the committee would be able to reverse the easing quickly if appropriate .
-- the draft statement for alternative a begins with a reference to the further intensification of the housing correction and recent weakening in business and consumer expenditures , and it also mentions increased strains in financial markets .",-0.5," if the committee judges that tighter financial conditions , higher oil prices , and soft incoming data point to a weaker economic outlook than previously anticipated , then it may deem a more accommodative stance of policy to be appropriate and ease policy 25 basis points , as in alternative b .
 the real federal funds rate is nearly half a percentage point above its downwardly revised greenbook- consistent equilibrium value and a touch above the upper end of the range of model- based estimates ( chart 5 ) , suggesting that a reduction in the target funds rate may be required to keep output near its potential .
 several policy rules ( chart 7 ) also suggest that further policy easing would be appropriate .
 moreover , members might be concerned about the risk of possible further deterioration in financial conditions , particularly in the run - up to year - end , or about the potential for significant spillovers from the housing sector to the broader economy .
 if so , they may judge that a policy easing at this meeting might help insure against such developments .
 at the same time , the committee may believe that the risks to inflation associated with a 25 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate are modest , given recent readings on core inflation and the current outlook for prices .
 after noting that “ economic growth is slowing ” and that “ strains in financial markets have increased , ” the statement for alternative b suggests that the 25 basis point reduction in the target funds rate , together with the two previous policy actions , is likely to help promote moderate growth over time .
 the statement notes the modest improvement in core inflation this year but indicates that “ some inflation risks remain . ”   rather than provide an explicit assessment of the balance of risks , the statement concludes that uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation has increased and that the committee will “ continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments ” and act as needed to foster its dual objectives .
 market participants appear to place about two - thirds odds on a 25 basis point reduction in the target at this meeting , with most of the remaining probability class
 fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 23 of 43 assigned to a 50 basis point move .
 as a result , short - term interest rates would likely rise modestly in response to alternative b .   however , judging from the desk ’s survey of dealers , the statement under alternative b would likely be read as broadly consistent with market expectations for additional policy easing .
 consequently , longer - term interest rates , equity prices , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would be little changed .
-- it then notes that the outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat and , unlike alternative b ,",-0.5," if the committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable growth and acceptable inflation over time , then it might be inclined to choose alternative c .
 members might read the incoming macroeconomic data as broadly consistent with the outlook underlying its october policy decision , including the expectation for a period of relatively slow growth late this year and early next year .
 conditions in short - term funding markets have deteriorated notably over the intermeeting period and credit has tightened further for some households and businesses , increasing the downside risks to growth .
 however , the committee might feel that the adverse effects of such developments are likely to be limited and that its earlier easing actions — and perhaps arrangement of swap lines with foreign central banks and implementation of a term auction facility — provide ample insurance .
 moreover , members may be concerned that the unsettled state of financial markets may make it difficult for committee to quickly reverse further policy easing , even if the prospects for economic growth improve .
 and , although core inflation has stayed moderate and the baseline outlook for inflation may be viewed as acceptable , members may view elevated oil and other commodity prices and a weaker dollar as posing large enough upside risks to inflation to make an immediate reduction in the target funds rate problematic .
 under these circumstances , the committee might see maintenance of the current stance of policy for now as appropriate but judge that downside risks to growth have become the dominant concern .
 such an approach would leave the committee well placed to see whether financial market strains diminish significantly after year - end and to accumulate additional information on the outlook for growth and inflation before deciding whether further policy easing should be implemented .
 fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 26 of 43
 the proposed statement for alternative c acknowledges that economic growth appears to be slowing but indicates explicitly that the softening is broadly in line with what the committee had anticipated .
 it then notes the increase in financial market strains and acknowledges that they pose greater downside risk to growth , but suggests that the monetary policy easing already in place is likely to promote moderate expansion over time .
 the wording on inflation closely follows the october statement .
 the draft statement then suggests that downside risks to growth are the predominant concern and concludes with the language used in the august and earlier statements that “ future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth , as implied by incoming information .",0,,,-0.25
115,2008-03-18," if the committee judges that the news on economic activity and financial markets since the january meeting has appreciably undermined the outlook for the economy and is reasonably confident that inflation will moderate , it might prefer to move more aggressively to promote growth and mitigate downside risks by cutting the funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative a .   despite the five policy moves over the past six months , the substantial downward revision to the greenbook forecast suggests class
 i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 29 of 39 that significantly more easing than previously foreseen may be required to stave off a severe deterioration in macroeconomic conditions .
 indeed , in light of the rapidly eroding financial situation in recent weeks , policymakers might see an even weaker outlook than in the greenbook that would ultimately require even more policy easing than assumed in the staff forecast .
 alternatively , policymakers might see the cumulative 125 basis points of easing assumed in the staff forecast as likely to prove necessary to restore output to its potential , but might prefer to deliver the easing in a more rapid manner than in the staff forecast , in order to arrest the deterioration in investor sentiment currently afflicting financial markets .
 the downside risks around the growth outlook might be particularly worrisome , given the steeper - than - expected declines in house prices and the intensification of strains in financial markets .
 in such circumstances , the committee might view the odds of an intensifying adverse feedback cycle — that is , a worsening of the macroeconomic situation generating further distress in financial markets and among financial institutions , thereby prompting a further tightening in the supply of credit and so putting further downward pressure on real activity — as having risen appreciably over the intermeeting period ( a possibility suggested by the greenbook scenario , “ greater housing correction with more financial fallout ” ) .
 members might also find the case for a 75 basis point cut to be persuasive if they would be willing to tolerate a somewhat higher path for inflation than in the staff forecast in order to respond more aggressively to the prospect of significant weakness in output .
 instead , members might be more optimistic about the outlook for inflation than the staff .
 for example , with the unemployment rate seen as likely to rise markedly , policymakers might anticipate that workers will become particularly concerned about job security , a situation that could restrain wage demands and reduce cost pressures by more than assumed in the baseline forecast ( a possibility suggested by the “ worker insecurity ” scenario in the greenbook ) .
 with market participants putting significant odds on both 50 basis point and 75 basis point cuts at this meeting , selection of alternative a would likely leave short- and intermediate - term interest rates a little lower .
 market participants would probably interpret such an aggressive interest rate cut , together with the indication that downside risks to growth predominate , as suggesting that the committee is inclined to further policy easing .
 this combination might bolster market confidence , causing equity prices to rise and credit spreads on corporate debt to narrow some .
 however , longer - term yields might move higher if market participants became concerned that the committee was underestimating inflation risks or was more willing to tolerate higher rates of inflation going forward than earlier anticipated .",-0.75," the rationale section of the statement accompanying alternative b would begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity , pointing specifically to the softening in consumer expenditures and labor markets .
 the statement would also point out that financial markets remain under considerable stress and that the tightening of credit conditions , coupled with the deepening of the housing contraction , is likely to weigh on economic growth in the near term .
 the paragraph on inflation would note that the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters assuming “ a projected leveling - out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource class
 i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 28 of 39 utilization . ”
 this alternative would highlight the risks that attend the committee ’s expectation regarding the trajectory for inflation by indicating that “ uncertainty about the outlook for inflation has increased ” and would note that the committee “ will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully . ”
 the final paragraph would repeat the assessment of risks from the january statement .
 investors place roughly even odds on both 50 basis point and 75 basis point reductions in the target federal funds rate at this meeting .   as a result , adoption of alternative b would likely cause near - term policy expectations to move somewhat higher .
 equity prices might decline , and yield spreads on private - debt instruments over those on treasuries could widen , should market participants conclude that monetary policy was not being eased sufficiently promptly to cushion adequately the weakness in economic activity .
 any such adverse effects , however , would likely be tempered by the committee
 ’s acknowledgment that the downside risks to growth remain and that the committee is prepared to act in a timely manner to address those risks , a communication that would likely be interpreted as indicating that members are still predisposed to ease policy further .
 given the smaller - than - expected policy move and the indication in the statement of greater concern about inflation risks , market participants could mark down their inflation expectations slightly .
 any move in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be relatively small .
 however , in light of impaired trading conditions in many markets and investors ’ increasingly skittish attitudes , even small policy surprises have the potential to generate an outsized reaction in financial markets .
-- the assessment of risks class i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 30 of 39 differs from that in alternative b by noting explicitly the risks to both growth and inflation .
-- as under alternative b , the statement would point out that members expect “ inflation to moderate in coming quarters , ” but would conclude that “ the upside risks to the outlook for inflation have increased .",-0.5," if the committee believes that the economic outlook has weakened but is concerned that aggressive further policy easing amid unfavorable inflation readings could increase the likelihood of a rise in longer - term inflation expectations , it may wish to lower the funds rate target by just 25 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative c .   in particular , this alternative might be favored if the factors underlying the recent increase in inflation were viewed as likely to be more persistent than envisaged in the staff ’s projection .
 in light of recent data , the committee might see the short - run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation as having worsened to a greater extent than judged by the staff and believe that the scope for monetary policy to provide stimulus to growth while applying adequate restraint to inflation has decreased noticeably .
 such a deterioration in the short - run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation could reflect in part an increase in inflation expectations , as illustrated in the greenbook
 ’s “ more inflationary pressures ” scenario .
 the difficulty of reliably detecting shifts in inflation class
 i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 31 of 39 expectations may bolster the case for this alternative , especially if the committee perceives an upward drift of such expectations as being very costly to unwind .
-- ( 33 ) the statement accompanying alternative c would explicitly acknowledge that the upside risks to inflation have increased by pointing to recent unfavorable readings on inflation and by emphasizing the factors that could potentially exert upward pressure on inflation going forward .
 a decision to adopt alternative c would come as a significant surprise to the financial markets .
 investors would presumably revise up sharply their expectations for the path of policy over the next few quarters , leading to an increase in short- and intermediate- term interest rates .
 at the same time , long - term nominal treasury yields would likely rise by less or could even fall if investors concluded that the fomc had a lower tolerance for inflation than they had previously thought .
 with real rates higher , equities would fall , credit spreads on corporate debt would widen , strains in financial markets would intensify , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise .
-- ”   the rationale portion pertaining to the outlook for inflation would be identical to that in alternative c .",-0.25," if the committee believes that economic growth is likely to resume an acceptable pace before long and that inflation is on a higher trajectory than in the greenbook , it might prefer to leave the stance of policy unchanged , as in alternative d .
 although measures of consumer and business sentiment have declined , the committee might view the data on final demand as only a bit weaker than expected class i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 32 of 39 and judge that financial turmoil , while posing significant risks , is likely to have less of an effect on aggregate demand than anticipated by the staff .
 moreover , monetary policy has been eased considerably and substantial fiscal stimulus has been enacted , factors that are likely to provide a significant boost to aggregate demand in coming quarters .
 accordingly , policymakers might prefer to wait for additional information about the extent of that boost before making any further policy adjustments .
 in addition , given the recent run - up in energy and other commodity prices , the drop in the foreign exchange value of the dollar , and the apparent slight increase in long - term inflation expectations , the committee might now see it as increasingly unlikely that inflation will decline at an acceptable pace and might believe that the upside risks to inflation have risen unacceptably .
 a pause at this juncture might be particularly appealing to policymakers who prefer a more distinct downward tilt to the trajectory for inflation over the next few years than that shown in the greenbook , such as that illustrated by the optimal - control simulation with an inflation goal of 1½ percent .
-- ( 36 ) the first paragraph of the rationale portion of the statement associated with alternative d would acknowledge that economic activity has been weak and that financial markets remain under considerable stress .
 given the expectations embedded in financial market prices of further substantial policy easing at this meeting , a decision to adopt alternative d would stun market participants , leading to a sharp upward revision of their short - term outlook for the path of policy and a significant increase in short - term interest rates .

116,2008-08-05,,N," if the committee views the staff forecast , which is conditioned on an unchanged target federal funds rate through the end of the year , as reasonable and sees the outcome as acceptable in the circumstances , it may wish to leave the policy rate unchanged at this meeting , as in alternative b .   the committee , like the staff , may expect financial conditions and the sharp contraction in the housing market to exert considerable restraint on aggregate spending over the next year or so , and thus may view a relatively low real federal funds rate as necessary to promote moderate economic growth .
 at the same time , the resilience to date in consumer spending may provide some assurance to policy makers that overall economic activity , though sluggish , is continuing to expand and is likely to accelerate gradually in coming quarters as the contraction in the housing sector begins to fade and financial market conditions begin to improve .

 the substantial easing of monetary policy to date , combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity , should help to promote moderate growth over time .
 although downside risks to growth remain , they appear to have diminished somewhat , and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased .

 although downside risks to growth remain , the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee .

 the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability .
 fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 27 of 36 increase in coming months , the committee may anticipate that inflation pressures will moderate later this year and through next year .
 with such an outlook , the committee may judge that holding the funds rate constant at this meeting is appropriate given its dual objectives .
 indeed , the optimal - control simulation with an inflation goal of 2 percent , shown in chart 7 , prescribes a target funds rate that remains at roughly its current level through the end of 2009 before beginning to firm thereafter .
 the committee may also see risk considerations as arguing for an unchanged stance of policy at this meeting .
 surely , the downside risks to growth remain significant : consumer spending could weaken substantially , given the low level of consumer confidence , the weakening labor market , and diminishing credit availability ; fiscal policy may provide less impetus than currently anticipated ; and financial markets remain under considerable stress and may impose more restraint on growth than currently anticipated .
 at the same time , the persistent tendency of energy prices to increase in recent years — and importantly , the resulting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations—
 may cause the committee to feel that the upside risks to inflation are also substantial .
 overall , the committee may still see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation .
 in these circumstances , the committee may wish to leave the target funds rate unchanged and await further economic and financial information before adjusting the stance of policy .
 in the statement under alternative b , most of the discussion of the outlook for growth is little changed from june .
 the statement notes that economic activity has continued to expand , “ partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports . ”
 this characterization has been changed from “ some firming in household spending ” because consumer spending slowed a bit in the second quarter and increases in exports have been contributing significantly to output growth and are expected to continue to do so .
 the statement again notes that “ labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress . ”
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 28 of 36 language refers to “ elevated energy prices ” instead of “ the rise in energy prices ” because oil and natural gas prices have moved down , on net , since the last meeting , but remain high .
 the statement under alternative b would differ from the one in june by moving the sentence stating that past policy easing and federal reserve liquidity facilities should “ promote moderate economic growth ” from the assessment of risks paragraph to the economic rationale paragraph .
 in so doing , the factors that explain the outlook for economic activity are consolidated in the same paragraph , making the treatment parallel to that of the outlook for inflation .
 the rationale section makes the frank observation that “ inflation has been high , ” and attributes this situation to the previous increases in energy and other commodity prices .
 while the statement continues to note that the committee expects inflation to moderate through time , it also indicates that “ uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high . ”
 the assessment goes on to state that “ although downside risks to growth remain , the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee .
 ” although it does not explicitly make a judgment as to the relative weight of these risks , on the whole the statement gives a bit more emphasis to the upside risks to inflation than the june statement .
 the statement uses the same language as in june to note that the committee will monitor developments and will “ act as needed ” to achieve its dual objectives .
 futures and options quotes suggest that investors do not expect any change in policy until the end of this year .
 moreover , market participants have taken particular note of monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period that seemed to stress the significant downside risks to economic growth , and most respondents to the desk ’s survey do not expect the statement to suggest increased inflation concerns .
 as a result , the language envisioned under alternative b might lead investors to conclude that policy tightening may commence sooner than currently thought .
 short - term interest rates would probably increase a bit following such an class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 29 of 36 announcement .
 longer - term interest rates would likely also move higher , but inflation compensation might tick down if investors surmised that policymakers were a little less tolerant of inflation than currently perceived .
 equity prices would probably decline some , while the exchange value of the dollar might increase .",0," if the committee sees the economy as growing more robustly than the staff does and has fairly high confidence in the resilience of financial markets , it may prefer to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in alternative c .
 members may view the current stance of policy as too accommodative , providing substantial impetus to aggregate demand at a time when the economy apparently retains an unexpected degree of momentum and when inflation expectations may be less tightly moored than previously .
 if the committee is more upbeat about the underlying strength of the economy than the staff , along the lines of the “ resilient spending ” greenbook alternative scenario , members may believe that the time is right to reduce the current degree of policy accommodation so as to foster the desired moderation in inflation .
 although financial market conditions remain strained , and downside risks to growth persist , members may see those risks as having diminished considerably over recent months and believe that some of the policy accommodation that served as insurance against an extremely adverse outcome for economic growth should be removed .
 this view may be strengthened by the expectation that the various measures that the federal reserve has put in place to bolster market liquidity , including the new steps announced on july 30 , will help to mitigate the risk that policy tightening could have an outsized impact on financial market functioning .
 moreover , high readings on inflation have persisted for some time and could be causing inflation expectations to move higher , as illustrated in the greenbook
 inflation spiral ” scenario .
 finally , members may wish to bring inflation down more rapidly than in the greenbook projection and thus wish to begin tightening policy at this meeting , perhaps along the lines of the optimal control simulation with an inflation target of 1½ percent .

 investors marked down their expected policy path over the intermeeting period and now place very low odds on a rate hike at this meeting , or indeed before the end of the year .
 accordingly , they would be quite surprised by the adoption of alternative c .
 the expected trajectory for the federal funds rate would be marked up , perhaps substantially .
 short - term rates would rise accordingly , as the new , higher path for policy was built into asset prices .
 longer - term rates would probably increase as well , but inflation compensation would likely decline a bit , as investors concluded that the committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation .
 equity prices would fall on the news , while the exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate .
 if market participants interpreted this action as implying that policy would be tightened fairly rapidly in the near term , strains in financial markets could worsen , and perhaps significantly so if a tighter path for policy was seen as likely to depress house prices further or more rapidly than currently expected .
 in response to the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 31 of 36 emphasis given to inflation developments in the statement , investors might respond more sharply to incoming news bearing directly on consumer prices over subsequent weeks .

117,2008-09-16," if the committee sees recent developments as pointing to a weaker economic outlook and less pronounced inflation pressures , members may instead be attracted to the statement language of alternative a .   the substantial decline in energy prices in recent months , if not reversed , will pull down top - line inflation , which may prevent elevated inflation rates from becoming embedded in expectations .
 indeed , near - term inflation expectations have come down appreciably over the intermeeting period , as has five - by - five inflation compensation .
 moreover , the passthrough of the lower energy prices , coupled with a higher level of unemployment , should add to downward pressure on core inflation .
 members may also see the recent marked rise in the exchange value of the dollar as likely to contribute to a reduction in inflation while restraining overall economic growth .
 in addition , financial strains appear to have extended to a wider range of financial institutions over the intermeeting period , in some cases creating severe pressures on their balance sheets and even uncertainty about their solvency .
 the ongoing pullback in credit availability has the potential to weigh on economic growth for a considerable period , as in the “ more - persistent headwinds ” scenario discussed in the greenbook .
 the real federal funds rate ( based on lagged four - quarter core pce inflation ) is roughly in line with its greenbook - consistent equilibrium value , which the committee may see as an appropriate policy stance in the present circumstances ( chart 6 ) .
 still , the committee may now see risks to both inflation and output as considerable and roughly equal and may wish to adjust the language in the statement to treat them symmetrically .
 despite the changes in the statement language in alternative a , the market reaction may not be very large .
 the observation that the substantial decline in oil prices is likely to contribute to a moderation in inflation will come as no surprise to market participants .
 furthermore , investors already expect policy to be unchanged for several quarters and reportedly read the august statement as essentially signaling a shift to a balanced assessment of risks , so a more explicit indication in that regard may not spark much reaction .
 indeed , the desk ’s survey found that primary dealers expect the statement to be changed slightly to indicate a somewhat weaker outlook for growth and reduced inflationary pressures .
 still , the greater confidence expressed in the statement that inflation will moderate may be seen as freeing up the committee to ease policy if necessary should the outlook for the economy worsen .
 in consequence , short - term interest rates may decline somewhat following such an announcement .
 long - term rates would likely edge down only a bit if at all , while inflation compensation could tick higher if investors see the fomc as having become less vigilant with respect to inflation risks .
 equity prices may increase moderately , and the exchange value of the dollar might decline a little .
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 34 of 41 money and debt forecasts",0,"-- apart from these changes , alternative b is little different from the committee
 in the statement under alternative b
 , the rationale begins by noting that “ incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent months , ” which is changed from “ economic activity expanded in the second quarter ” to shift the discussion to the current quarter and reflect the significant , albeit expected , deceleration that appears to be under way .
 in light of the continued deterioration in labor market conditions , the statement then indicates that labor markets have “ weakened ” further , rather than “ softened ” as in august .
 the statement again notes that “ financial markets remain under considerable stress ” and then states that “ tight credit conditions , the ongoing housing contraction , some slowing in export growth , and past increases in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth .
 some slowing in export growth ” is included to recognize that , after surging about 11 percent over the four quarters ending in q2 , exports are projected to decelerate to a rate more in line with historical norms , and “ past increases in ” energy prices are referenced rather than “ elevated ” energy prices because the net rise in energy prices over the past year or so continues to restrain growth despite the recent marked decline in prices .
 the remainder of the statement under alternative b is unchanged from that released by the committee in august , indicating that the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 30 of 41 substantial easing of monetary policy will promote economic growth ; that the committee expects inflation to moderate , but the outlook is uncertain ; and that , although downside risks to growth remain , upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern .
 futures and options quotes as well as
 the desk ’s survey of primary dealers suggest that market participants do not expect any change in policy until the third quarter of next year .
 investors read the statement released in august as consistent with an outlook for unchanged policy , so alternative b , which is very similar , would probably not lead them to revise their views .
 market participants will note the shift in focus of the discussion to the weaker economic activity in the current quarter , but they will probably take more direction from the forward - looking parts of the statement , which are unchanged .   in sum , short- and longer - term interest rates , equity prices , and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in response to an announcement along the lines of alternative b .",0," if the committee both thinks that it is important that it be seen to be responding to the continued high levels of inflation and has fairly high confidence in the resilience of financial markets and economic activity , it may prefer to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in alternative c .   pce inflation in the third quarter is projected to be its highest since the first quarter of 1990 – and above 2 percent for its eleventh consecutive quarter – and some measures of longer - term inflation expectations remain above their levels of recent years .   against this backdrop , the committee may feel that failing to tighten policy could lead market participants and households to question its commitment to price stability , as in the “ unanchored inflation expectations ” alternative scenario in the greenbook .
 moreover , most simple policy rules call for a federal funds rate that is considerably above its current level ( chart 8) .
 although financial market conditions remain strained , members may judge that the financial situation is being adequately addressed class
 i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 31 of 41 by the various measures that the federal reserve has put in place to support market liquidity and by the treasury
 ’s actions to stabilize fannie mae and freddie mac .
 as a result , the committee may see the slowdown in growth as transitory , along the lines of the “ financial rebound ” greenbook alternative scenario , and be concerned that holding the federal funds rate at its current level would impart excessive momentum to the economy going forward , undercutting efforts to bring inflation down .
-- the inflation paragraph in alternative c indicates that “ inflation has remained high . ”
 market participants are very confident in their outlook for no change in policy at this meeting and would be quite surprised by the adoption of alternative c .
 the expected trajectory of the federal funds rate for the next several months would likely be marked up at least 25 basis points , and might move up further if investors thought the committee was more likely to raise rates going forward .
 other short- term interest rates would rise accordingly .
 longer - term rates would probably increase as well .
 inflation compensation would likely decline a bit , as investors concluded that the committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation .
 equity prices would fall , perhaps sharply , while the exchange value of the dollar would probably class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 32 of 41 appreciate .
 the policy surprise , along with the potentially large and unexpected movements in asset prices , would likely intensify strains in financial markets , perhaps significantly .",0.25,,,0.0
