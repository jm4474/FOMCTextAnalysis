Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) The money stock and reserve aggregates have shown a mixed

performance relative to the Committee's ranges of tolerance during the

January-February target period. For most of the period since the last

meeting, M1 and RPD's appeared to be growing at rates well below the low

ends of their ranges. However, a sharp rise of M1 in the first two weeks

of February (with the second week based on preliminary and partly estimated

data) brought the growth rate back within the range of tolerance, M2 remained

within its range for most of the period, as growth in consumer-type time and

savings deposits was strong, and moved slightly above the top of the range

when the preliminary data for the second week of February became available.

(2) In January, M1 declined at a 3.1 per cent annual rate,

instead of rising slightly as originally indicated. The sharp rise

of M 1 in the first two weeks of February suggests a growth rate for the month

of around 11 per cent. Some part of this February increase in private balances

may be related to a very sharp and considerably greater than anticipated

decline in U.S. Government deposits.

(3) Growth of RPD's in the January-February period appears to be

somewhat below the lower end of the Committee's range of tolerance. As

shown in the table below, RPD's supporting private demand deposits are

declining substantially--rather than rising slightly as expected--reflecting

mainly the impact on required reserves, as lagged two weeks, of changes in

the weekly pattern of demand deposit flows. Excess reserves also are running

lower than expected, on average, thus reducing the need to supply reserves

through open market operations. CD's and other time deposits have been

absorbing more RPD's than anticipated.

new estimates of deposit data.



(4) Conditions have eased significantly in the Federal funds

market since the last Committee meeting. The funds rate had averaged 9.60

per cent in the statement week of January 23 that encompassed the meeting.

Shortly after the meeting, in light of the decision taken by the Committee,

the Desk began supplying reserves at a pace consistent with a funds rate in

a 9¼--9½ per cent range. Subsequent operations were conditioned by the

Treasury financing then in process. Shortfalls in growth rates of M1 and

RPD relative to the Committee's ranges of tolerance led to somewhat more

active reserve supplying operations, and the funds rate averaged 8.93 per

cent in the week ended February 13. The Desk is currently aiming at a

reserve supply consistent with a funds rate of around 9 per cent.

(5) As the funds market has eased in recent weeks, declines in

other short-term rates have ranged around 100 basis points and the bank

prime loan rate has dropped from 9¾ to 9 per cent at some banks. Reductions

in market rates have occurred even though the volume of directly placed and

dealer placed commercial paper coming to market was exceptionally heavy

and a sizable amount of large CD's was marketed by commercial banks, given

large business loan growth and a favorable market atmosphere. Despite the

drop in short-term market rates, member bank borrowing at the Fed was

maintained, averaging around $1.1 billion during the past four weeks,

slightly higher than in the previous four weeks.

(6) Yields in all sectors of the bond market have also been

subject to downward pressure since the January FOMC meeting, notwithstand-

ing a heavy volume of new corporate and municipal issues brought to market

and fairly aggressive lengthening of maturities by the Treasury in its mid-

February refunding. These latest reductions in long-term rates offset a

sizable part of the increases recorded in late December and early January.



-4-

(7) The Treasury auctioned three new debt issues totaling $4.05

billion during the last week in January to refinance $4.5 billion of publicly

held debt maturing in mid-February. The issues--$1.5 billion of a 3¼-year,

6-7/8 per cent note; $2.25 billion of a 7-year, 7 per cent note; and $300

million of a 19½-year, 7½ per cent bond--were well received by the market.

All were sold at premiums; both the 7-year note and the 19½-year bond are

currently trading at prices above their auction averages, while the price of

the 3 -year note is close to its average. However, dealer awards in the

auction were large--amounting to about $1.6 billion in total. Dealers have

since distributed only about one-fourth of these awards, but they have not

been pressing aggressively thus far to market their remaining holdings.

(8) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time

periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth rates computed on

a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter

basis.

(inter-meeting period)

(10) Alternative B includes the 5¾ per cent annual growth rate

for M1 for the period from December to June adopted by the Committee at its

last meeting, which is depicted in the chart on the following page. The

longer-run growth of M2 implied by this alternative is around 10 per cent,

about 2 percentage points higher than indicated at the last Committee

meeting. 1/ The increase in M2 growth reflects the greater than expected

strength of recent net inflows of consumer-type time deposits at banks and

the lower average level of market interest rates that has already developed

and is assumed to continue into the months ahead under this alternative.

Alternatives A and C contemplate faster and slower rates of monetary growth,

respectively.

1/ For M3, the implied growth rate is 9 per cent, about 1½ percentage points
higher than indicated at the last meeting.

(11) A longer-run 5¾ per cent growth path for M1 is associated

with lower interest rates than in the previous blue book mainly because

of the downward revision in nominal GNP expansion projected by the staff.

At the time of the last Committee meeting, economic activity at current

prices was projected to expand at a 6½ per cent annual rate in the first

half of the year, whereas a 5½ per cent expansion is now projected. This

would be expected to lower transactions demands for money and therefore

to reduce the interest rates associated with a given growth in the money

supply.

(12) With short-term interest rates having declined by around

one percentage point since the last meeting, market rates have already

moved close to levels that now seem consistent with a 5¾ per cent M1

growth. Thus, little or no further decline would be expected under

alternative B. The Federal funds rate range for that alternative is

indicated at 8¼--9½ per cent, centering close to the recently prevailing

level.

(13) Recent interest rate declines will be working to sustain

money demand in the months ahead, including demand for both cash balances

and interest-earning deposits. In the February-March period, M1 growth

in a 7½--9½ per cent annual rate range is indicated under alternative B.

Because of the sizable shortfall of M 1 in January, such a rate of in-

crease is needed to restore M1 to the desired longer-run growth path.

Growth of M1 in February may be particularly large, reflecting perhaps

a decline in U.S. Government deposits between January and February that

is virtually unprecedented in size. The Treasury redeemed $800 million

of maturing debt in mid-February and the cash deficit for February also

seems to be a little larger than seasonal.



(16) Growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits at

banks is likely to continue generally strong, perhaps bolstered by a build-

up in precautionary balances by consumers. The growth, however, will

probably slacken a little from that of January, when net inflows (as in

October) may have been enlarged somewhat by an increased amount of

interest crediting (taking place on the final day of quarters) resulting

from the higher ceiling rates. Under alternative A, growth in consumer-

type time deposits would probably be even more rapid for a while--at least

until further declines in market rates lead banks to begin reducing

offering rates for consumer-type deposits. The expected rise of interest

rates under alternative C would reduce the relative attractiveness of

consumer-type time deposits, though, judging from recent experience, the

effect of higher market rates might be more marked on the specialized

thrift institutions than on commercial banks.

(17) With funds available in volume through consumer-type time

deposits, banks are not expected to be aggressive issuers of large CD's

in the weeks ahead. Business loan demand at banks may not moderate

substantially from the January pace until the rate of overall business

inventory accumulation slackens, as is projected for the spring. However,

mortgage and consumer credit demands are likely to be quite modest in the

period immediately ahead, given the weakness in home buying and in sales

of cars, mobile homes, and recreational equipment.

(18) In time, the recent removal of capital controls and large

international funds flows stemming from the rise in oil prices may come to

have an appreciable effect on domestic banking aggregates and market



-9-

conditions. Thus far, however, discernible effects have been minor, and

have included mainly reports of offerings of longer-term dollar-denominated

CD's to U.S. investors by foreign affiliates of U.S. banks, and reports of

strong interest by U.S. and foreign corporations in shifting longer-term

borrowing from the Euro-dollar market to U.S. capital markets. The potential

for investment in the United States of funds from the oil-exporting countries

is even more dramatic, but here too there has been little indication of

sizable money-flows. Under the circumstances, we have not yet made any

special allowance for the effects of international financial developments

on domestic markets and aggregates.



Proposed directive

(19) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to delete the reference

to Treasury financing because the quarterly refunding announced on January 30

has been virtually completed.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account [DEL: of the

forthcoming Treasury financing and] of international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate

SOMEWHAT GREATER growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account [DEL: of the

forthcoming Treasury financing and] of international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account [DEL: of the

forthcoming Treasury financing and] of international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with QUITE

moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
