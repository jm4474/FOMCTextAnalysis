Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The federal funds rate averaged near its intended level of 5-1/2 percent over the

intermeeting period. Intermediate- and long-term rates fell 5 to 30 basis points over the

period (chart). Markets were responding primarily to developments overseas--in particular,

further deterioration in several Asian economies, along with the associated strengthening of

the dollar and turmoil in financial markets in Asia and in emerging market economies

elsewhere, all of which damped the outlook for U.S. economic growth, strengthened market

participants' conviction that inflation would stay low, and prompted some investors to seek

the safety of U.S. Treasury instruments. Short-term rates, anchored by continued expectations

that the funds rate will remain at its current level for a while, generally fell by less, though

the three-month bill rate has moved down about 15 basis points over the last week, as turmoil

in a number of foreign markets persisted and in some cases intensified. The slope of the

nominal term structure from three months to ten years dropped to the low end of its range for

the past several years. However, it is not unusually flat relative to the slopes posted in the

1950s and 1960s, when inflation was well behaved on a sustained basis.

(2) Spreads between rates on private and Treasury securities generally rose over

the intermeeting period, especially for lower-rated issues. In part, the widening likely

reflected the increased value some investors attached to the safety and liquidity of Treasury

securities in light of the turmoil in emerging markets. However, it may also suggest that

some investors are taking a more cautious view of the outlook for the profits and financial

strength of businesses. This possible shift in attitude is also consistent with the performance

of the stock market despite the decline in interest rates: On balance, major stock indexes

have posted mixed changes since the last FOMC meeting. With the exception of the S&P

500, which touched a record high on June 26, most major indexes have fallen a few percent

from their peaks reached earlier this year.

(3) The dollar appreciated significantly in the early part of the intermeeting period,

led by an 8 percent rise against the yen. Evidence of a steep drop in economic activity in

Japan and a lack of confidence that government policies were coming to grips with the

country's economic and financial problems were the main factors behind the yen's weakness.

The bellwether government bond yield in Japan declined to a record low in early June on

speculation that the Bank of Japan might reduce its official discount rate. After reaching an

eight-year low against the dollar of almost 147 on June 15, the yen began to firm on rumors

of imminent intervention. On Wednesday, June 17, the Desk purchased yen

for $833 million for U.S.

accounts, split evenly between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. In conjunction with the

intervention, a statement by Japanese officials noted their government's intention to consider

further fiscal stimulus and to act quickly to resolve problems in their banking sector.

Immediately after the intervention, the dollar fell 4 percent against the yen and 1 percent

against the mark. Over the last week, however, the yen has given up all of its gains against

the dollar as it became clear that the Japanese government would not take immediate action

and as concerns about the viability of a number of major Japanese banks mounted. The yen

ended the intermeeting period down 4 percent against the dollar. Relative to continental



-3-

European currencies, the dollar has risen only modestly on net since the last FOMC meeting,

as declines in long-term interest rates in those countries about matched those on comparable

U.S. instruments. In contrast, the dollar fell 2 1/4 percent against sterling, which was buoyed

by a surprise increase of percentage point on June 4 in the Bank of England's official RP

rate and by subsequent incoming data that fostered expectations of at least one more rate

increase in the near term. On net, the foreign exchange value of the dollar relative to major

currencies increased more than 2 percent over the intermeeting period.

(4) Declines in the exchange value of the yen put added pressure on financial

markets in other Asian economies. Prior to the joint U.S.-Japanese intervention, Chinese

officials speculated openly about the possibility of abandoning the renminbi's current peg to

the dollar, but following the intervention and the yen's initial rebound, they reiterated their

commitment to their current exchange rate policy. The Indonesian rupiah has depreciated 20

percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period, pressured by political uncertainty.

Despite the drop in the rupiah, Indonesian stock prices rose 11 percent, and credit spreads on

the nation's sovereign foreign currency debt narrowed a bit over the intermeeting period. By

contrast, the currencies of other Asian economies depreciated slightly on average relative to

the dollar. However, these economies' equity markets were down about 5 to 25 percent, and

credit spreads on their dollar-denominated sovereign debts moved up 30 to 110 basis points.



-4-

(5) A number of other countries appeared to be affected over the intermeeting

period by a general increase in investors' concern about the outlook for emerging market

economies. Speculative pressure on the Russian ruble intensified in late May and again at the

end of June, as market participants reportedly became concerned about persistent shortfalls in

government revenues and the impact of lower commodity prices on Russian exports. The

government announced a new fiscal program that calmed markets for a while and made it

possible for the IMF to restart disbursements under Russia's suspended IMF program. Over

the intermeeting period as a whole, credit spreads on dollar-denominated Russian foreign

debts increased 330 basis points. Credit risk spreads for Latin American sovereign borrowers

widened 90 to 140 basis points, on balance, over the same period.

(6) Growth of the monetary aggregates moderated somewhat in the second quarter.

Smoothing through the tax-induced bulge in M2 growth in April and subsequent marked

slowing in May, growth in those two months averaged about a 6 percent rate, down from 8-1/2

percent over the first three months of the year. Preliminary data for June suggest a small

further moderation.2 Despite this slowing, through June of this year M2 has expanded at a 7-1/4

percent pace from the final quarter of last year, and velocity has declined over the first half at

an estimated 2-1/2 percent rate. More than 1 percentage point of this drop can be attributed to

identified special factors that have temporarily boosted deposit holdings, including the sharp

rise in mortgage refinancing and outsized tax payments. In addition, the demand for money

2. The staff had expected an even larger deceleration of M2 in the second quarter. Much of the
upward revision to M2 growth in May and June reflected data revisions. First-quarter call report data
showed fewer small time deposits in IRA and Keogh plans and more in M2 than we had estimated.
In addition, a large bank underreported its demand deposits in April and May owing to computer
problems following a merger. The bank provided revised data in early June.



-5-

relative to income may have been boosted by the comparative attractiveness of M2 assets as

rates on long-term fixed-rate instruments fell and by the effects of household portfolio

decisions in light of the sharp run-up of share prices in recent years. Growth in M3 has also

slowed in the last few months, reflecting the behavior of M2 Nonetheless, M3 has grown a

couple of percentage points faster than M2. The difference reflects continued very rapid

growth in the non-M2 components of M3, especially institution-only money funds, which

have made further gains in attracting corporate cash-management business. From the fourth

quarter of last year through June, M3 has grown at a 10-1/4 percent pace.

(7) Outside the federal sector, the growth in domestic nonfinancial debt has been

fairly rapid this year, owing to robust demand for credit and the availability of funds on

attractive terms from intermediaries and the capital markets. Business borrowing has been

strong in recent months, although it appears to have edged back from its very rapid pace in

the first quarter, when a surge in inventory investment probably added to already large credit

demands. With the yield curve quite flat and long-term corporate rates near their lowest

levels in some time, businesses have issued bonds in record volume this year. Household

debt growth also likely has slowed a bit from its first quarter pace but has remained brisk in

the second quarter. Mortgage debt has expanded particularly vigorously this year, buoyed by

the high level of home purchases and low long-term interest rates, which have encouraged

some households to substitute mortgage finance for higher-cost consumer debts. Despite the

continued strong growth in the debt of the nonfederal sectors, paydowns of federal debt made

possible by robust tax revenues trimmed the expansion of total domestic debt to a bit less



-6-

than 5 percent in recent months, reducing the growth rate of the aggregate from the fourth

quarter of last year through May to about 5-3/4 percent.

Longer-Term Strategies

(8) This section considers alternative longer-term strategies for monetary policy.

We do this by constructing a "baseline case" that extends the Greenbook forecast, bringing

unemployment gradually back to the NAIRU. We then use the staff model to construct an

alternative strategy that eventually achieves price stability--as proxied by core PCE inflation

of about 3/4 percent (on a 1999 measurement basis).

(9) Key factors underlying the extended baseline forecast, which also provide the

underpinnings for the alternative strategy, generally represent a continuation of conditions at

work in the Greenbook forecast. In labor markets, the NAIRU is 5.4 percent and the sacrifice

ratio is about 2--that is, a 1 percentage point reduction in inflation can be achieved by

pushing the unemployment rate above the NAIRU by the equivalent of 2 percentage points

for one year. On the demand side, the federal government runs a small budget surplus that

remains about unchanged as a percent of nominal GDP. Stock market wealth rises more

slowly than nominal income; the price-earnings ratio declines over the simulation horizon

from about 28 to around 21, still somewhat high by historical standards. Finally, the current

account deficit continues to worsen over time. This development, which is driven by stronger

secular growth in the demand for imports in the United States than for U.S. exports overseas,

occurs despite a return to trend growth abroad and a partial offset from a sustained mild

depreciation in the real foreign exchange value of the dollar. These last three influences

progressively restrain aggregate demand relative to potential and consequently over time

reduce the real federal funds rate needed to hold the economy at potential.



-9-

(10) In the baseline strategy, shown by the solid lines in Chart 2, the current level

of the real funds rate is sufficient to bring about a gradual rise in the unemployment rate,

given the other restraining influences on aggregate demand. However, because the

unemployment rate stays below the NAIRU through 2001, inflation continues to rise

somewhat after the end of the Greenbook forecast period. (As in the Greenbook, technical

changes to price indexes through 1999 hold down measured inflation, but we are assuming no

further adjustments after that.) Thus, by holding the nominal funds rate constant for the next

several years, in effect the Committee would be modestly easing, all else equal, because the

real funds rate edges down. The slow decline limits the long-term rise in the unemployment

rate, producing a "soft landing" by 2002, with unemployment at its steady-state rate and

inflation stable at 2-1/4 percent. Thereafter, the FOMC slowly reduces the nominal and real

funds rates so as to keep the economy at full employment in the face of a falling wealth-to-

income ratio and a worsening trade deficit.

(11) The price stability strategy (shown by the dashed lines) eventually achieves

effective price stability as gauged by an inflation rate of 3/4 percent, close to the estimated

measurement error. In this strategy, the Committee raises the nominal funds rate to a little

above 6 percent by the end of this year, and maintains it at that level through 1999. Inflation

begins to decline in 1999 even though unemployment remains below the NAIRU, reflecting a

rise in the dollar, the sharp slowing of real output (a "speed effect"), and the public's growing

recognition that the Federal Reserve is seeking a lower inflation rate. With inflation declining

and the nominal federal funds rate unchanged, the real federal funds rate climbs further to 4-1/2

percent, almost a percentage point above the baseline strategy. As inflation moves closer to

the Federal Reserve's assumed objective and the output gap widens, the Committee begins to

lower nominal rates in 2000 by enough to produce a gradual decline in the real funds rate, a

process that caps the rise in the unemployment rate at about 6-1/4 percent early in the next

decade and thereafter brings it slowly back down to NAIRU.

Ranges for Money and Debt

(12) The paragraphs below present projections for money and debt for 1998 and

1999 consistent with the Greenbook forecast. The table on page 13 and the discussion

following give the current ranges and alternatives that the Committee may wish to consider.

Projected Money and Debt Growth.

(13) M2 is projected to grow 6 percent this year, about 1-3/4 percentage points faster

than nominal GDP. The unusual strength in M2 is not associated with a decrease in the

traditional measure of opportunity costs--the three-month Treasury bill rate less the weighted-

average yield on M2 assets--which has been virtually unchanged this year and is expected to

remain constant under the staff forecast. A small part of the strength in M2 reflects a

temporary buildup in deposits associated with the recent surge in mortgage refinancings. In

addition, the demand for M2 assets in the first half of the year was perhaps augmented by the

effects of a strong stock market and reduced bond yields, and these influences should persist

for a while. However, with bond yields expected to decline no further and the stock market

slipping a bit, the boost to M2 growth from mortgage refinancing and portfolio adjustments is

expected to abate in 1999. The staff projects M2 growth of 4 percent for 1999, only a bit

faster than that of nominal GDP. (Historical and projected money and debt velocities are

plotted in Chart 3.)

(14) M3 is likely to grow a robust 9 percent this year, a bit faster than in 1997, as

depositories continue to see profitable opportunities to expand credit, and they begin to rely

somewhat less on increases in overseas and other non-M3 funding sources. Also, the

outsourcing of money management services by businesses to institutional money funds should

persist. Private debt is expected to grow quickly this year, lifting expansion of the domestic

nonfinancial debt aggregate to 5-1/2 percent, despite a surplus for the federal government.

Business borrowing is projected to remain robust, with investment spending moderating in

coming quarters but still outpacing internal financing given the anticipated weakening of

profits. Household borrowing also should be brisk this year, supporting strong spending on

housing and consumer durables. In 1999, total debt is projected to decelerate to a 4-1/2 percent

growth rate, owing primarily to slower expansion of nominal spending; any tightening in

credit terms and standards is expected to be modest and selective and not impinge on the

general availability of credit. As the increase in depository credit moderates next year, M3

growth is projected to throttle down to a 6-1/2 percent pace.

Rangesfor 1998 and 1999

(15) The table below summarizes the staff projections for money and debt and

presents three alternative sets of ranges for Committee consideration. Alternative I is the

current set of ranges (unchanged since July of 1995); alternative II raises the money ranges to

make them more consistent with the staff projections, particularly for 1999, and trims the debt

range to reflect the projected slowdown in this aggregate; 3 alternative III maintains the current

money ranges but lowers the debt range further, making it more consistent with the expected

growth of debt under conditions of price stability and no trend in debt velocity.

(16) Since the M2 range was first interpreted four years ago as reflecting the

behavior of this aggregate under price stability, the Committee has been reviewing whether

1998 and 1999. The implications of these projections for money and debt growth are discussed in

levels of M2 velocity and opportunity cost over four subperiods. The responsiveness of V2 to

opportunity cost implied by the left and right scales over each of the four subperiods is

constrained to equal the value derived using data from 1977 to 1990; however, the average

levels of velocity and opportunity cost were aligned in each subperiod. As can be seen from

the lower right panel, after the completion of the large shift in its level in the early 1990s, V2

recently has had about as close a relationship to short-run opportunity costs as over history.

The differences between the lines on Chart 4 (expressed as a percent of velocity) are plotted

in Chart 5; these plots confirm that, after allowing for the level shift in velocity, the

relationship recently has experienced about the same errors as previously. The relationship of

been performing about as well in predicting quarterly M2 growth in the last few years as over

its estimation period of 1964 to 1988.

(17) Nevertheless, even supposing there were no further disruptions to V2 of the

magnitude of those of the early 1990s, V2 may not be viewed as sufficiently predictable to

justify basing the ranges on projections. The upper panel of Chart 6 shows the Board staffs

ability to predict in February the growth of V2 over that year. It begins in 1983, when M2

became the monetary aggregate of greatest interest to the Committee. The solid line shows

the judgmental errors in predicting V2 and compares them to a range 4 percentage points in

width centered on the staff projection (as indicated by the dashed lines). In six of the last

fifteen years these errors by themselves (apart from any misforecast of nominal GDP) would

have caused M2 to fall outside this 4 percent range. Two of the misses in the 1980s are

attributable to deviations of the funds rate from the Greenbook assumption, as shown by the

adjusted V2 errors -- the dotted line.4 Nevertheless, the dotted line itself moves outside the

band on four occasions, showing that unpredictable shifts in money demand may throw M2

out of its range. However, M2 has provided some value as an indicator for nominal GDP, as

shown for example in the positive correlation of surprises in the behavior of M2 with

surprises in GDP relative to the Greenbook forecast (the bottom panel of Chart 6). Chart 7

depicts a similar analysis for M3. The V3 errors, adjusted for the effects of deviations of the

federal funds rate from Greenbook assumptions, have tended to be a bit larger than those for

4. A semi-elasticity (that is, the percent change of V2 for a percentage point change in the funds
rate) of 1.9 was used to adjust V2 for deviations of the funds rate from Greenbook assumptions, based
on the correlation between the errors in forecasting the two series over this period. This is slightly
stronger than the 1.6 interest semi-elasticity implied by the staffs traditional money demand model at
a funds rate of about 5 percent.

- 15-

V2, and, as suggested by the bottom panel, the relationship of M3 to GDP is a little weaker

than that for M2.

(18) Because M2 has some desirable indicator properties and because its velocity

has been no more unpredictable in the past few years than over the 1960-90 period, the

Committee might want to return to announcing a range based on its projection for this

monetary aggregate. Such a range also could be selected for M3 in order to establish a

consistent interpretation for all three ranges. If the Committee shifted to projection-based

ranges for M2 and M3 for 1998, substantial adjustments to the ranges that were set in

February would be needed to encompass the projected growth of those aggregates, particularly

if a cushion between projected growth and the upper bound were thought desirable. More

modest upward adjustments would be needed if the Committee shifted to a projection basis

for the provisional monetary ranges only for next year, given the staff projection of a

deceleration in these aggregates. The alternative II ranges were constructed to be consistent

with the staff forecast for 1999. The apparently stronger nominal GDP forecasts of

Committee members might imply somewhat faster money and debt growth, assuming the

Committee members' preliminary forecasts are based on approximately the same paths for

interest rates and stock prices as in the staff forecast. Those more rapid growth rates next

year would still be below the staff projections for 1998. Selection of projection-based ranges

need not signal that the monetary aggregates are again being given greater consideration in

policymaking. The Committee could explain that, even though it believed that velocity

behavior had become somewhat more predictable, it nevertheless was simply setting ranges

for money and debt consistent with its economic outlook and was not intending to adjust the



- 16-

stance of policy in response to deviations of the aggregates from their ranges. Alternatively,

the Committee may in fact wish to signal added emphasis on the money and debt aggregates

at this time of heightened uncertainties regarding the NAIRU and other nonmonetary leading

indicators of inflation, for such emphasis may help it communicate its concerns about

inflation pressures when policy needs to be tightened, particularly if the tightenings have a

preemptive quality. Careful explanation could make clear that the added emphasis does not

go so far as to imply a presumption that deviations from ranges would trigger policy

responses, only that money is one of the many indicators the Committee is using.

(19) On the other hand, the continuing possibility of major shifts in monetary

velocities and their lack of close predictability even in ordinary circumstances raise questions

about the value of employing ranges based on annual forecasts, even if such ranges are not

being used to guide policy. In consequence, the Committee may wish to retain the current

rationale for its M2 and M3 ranges. In addition, it may also wish to alter the rationale for its

debt range to provide a consistent interpretation for all three ranges. This shift would require

lowering the debt range, as in alternative III. The range given in this alternative is based on

price stability and the historical pattern (apart from the 1980s) of zero trend in the velocity of

debt. All of the alternative II ranges are centered around rates of money and credit growth

consistent with expansion of nominal GDP at a 3 percent annual rate; growth around that rate

would be associated with conditions of true price stability.5 If the Committee saw a higher

growth rate of potential GDP than does the staff, or preferred a small positive trend to

5. With an estimated remaining measurement error in GDP inflation of around 1/2 percentage
point, the staff projects growth of measured potential real GDP from 1999 at a 2-3/4 percent rate.



- 17-

inflation, abstracting from measurement error, in order to avoid potential risks to policy

associated with the zero bound on the nominal funds rate, ranges somewhat above those in

alternative III would be appropriate.

(20) Finally, the Committee might prefer to use the current ranges, alternative I, as

the provisional ranges for 1999 as well as to reaffirm them for 1998. Such a decision would

not preclude paying more attention to the money and credit aggregates as policy indicators

during the year. Nonetheless, the Committee may still feel too uncertain about prospective

monetary developments, even with somewhat more predictable behavior of velocity in the last

few years, to specify in advance the rates at which money growth would become worrisome.

As for debt, the slowdown projected by the staff for 1999 would not necessarily suggest

lowering the range below its current specification because that setting still readily

encompasses the staff projection. Indeed, with the Committee projecting faster nominal GDP

growth than the staff, more rapid debt growth would be probable as well, which would

undercut even further any need to alter the current range for the debt aggregate.



-18-

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(21) The data received since the May FOMC meeting suggest that the economy was

a little stronger in the first quarter than the staff had expected in the last Greenbook but that

its growth has cooled off more this quarter than had been projected. In the staff forecast for

this meeting, under an unchanged federal funds rate, growth over the next six quarters will

settle in at a little below the rate of increase in the economy's potential, as domestic demand

is damped by a further decline in inventory accumulation to a more sustainable level, and by

the ebbing of the effects of previous increases in equity prices and declines in bond yields.

Despite a modest incline to the jobless rate, unemployment is anticipated to remain below its

natural rate over the forecast period. As a consequence, inflation on an underlying basis will

pick up, though the rise in published inflation will be muted by technical adjustments.

(22) The choice of the unchanged policy stance of alternative B would seem to

follow if the Committee found the Greenbook forecast both probable and--despite the

projected upcreep in underlying inflation--acceptable. The Committee might be especially

willing to live with an outlook in which the most likely outcome was a modest increase in

inflation if it saw the risks around that outcome as unbalanced, with the odds of a

considerably larger and persistent rise in inflation less than those of a substantial weakening

in activity. Even if underlying inflation tendencies turn out to be a little more intense than

anticipated, weakness in commodity and import prices and damped inflation expectations

should restrain price increases for a time. Thus, the Committee should be able to react

sufficiently promptly to any emerging cost pressures in labor markets to limit any incipient

increase in inflation and inflation expectations. On the demand side, an important



- 19-

vulnerability of the staff forecast revolves around developments overseas. That forecast

embodies more stable foreign financial markets and a recovery in the Japanese economy

starting in the second half of the year. However, so long as conditions in Asian economies

and emerging market economies elsewhere stay unsettled and the eventual implementation of

effective measures to deal with those conditions remains uncertain, the Committee may see a

distinct possibility of substantially greater drag on the U.S. economy from the external sector

than is in the staff forecast. Moreover, developments abroad may not be wholly immune to

monetary policy actions within the United States, and the Committee might be willing to

delay action for a time, at the risk of a possible pickup in inflation, to avoid further

complicating the already unsteady situation in Asia and several non-Asian emerging market

economies.

(23) Financial market prices appear to embody the anticipation that monetary policy

is on hold for some time, so the choice of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B

should elicit little response in money, capital, or foreign exchange markets. If the economic

data reveal, as under the staff projection, a considerable slowing in spending and muted

inflation, intermediate- and longer-term yields could edge lower, while equity prices could

falter as corporate profits again prove disappointing. This downward pressure on yields,

however, may be offset somewhat to the extent that the situation in emerging markets does

show signs of stabilizing as in the forecast, perhaps unwinding some of the flight-to-quality

effects that Treasury yields now reflect.

(24) The Committee might favor the quarter-point tightening of alternative C if it

viewed the updrift in underlying inflation in the staff forecast as unacceptable. Indeed, the



-20-

Committee may view the recent upside surprises in core consumer price inflation, coupled

with the persistently low level of the unemployment rate, as implying that inflation may

advance to even higher rates than the staff has built into its forecast. That risk would be

exacerbated if the staff has overestimated the extent of the coming slowdown in spending

growth, considering still-accommodative conditions in financial markets, as well as the ability

of the economy to expand without intensifying pressures on prices. In that environment,

putting off policy action in deference to uncertain conditions in foreign markets may pose too

great a risk to the continued good performance of the U.S. economy, and the longer-term

health of the global economy itself, particularly as a quick resolution to the problems abroad

is probably not in the cards. Given the current high levels of resource utilization, the

Committee might believe that delay would only raise the odds that greater, probably more

wrenching, policy tightening will be required later.

(25) Tighter policy at this meeting, perhaps involving a move in the federal funds

rate to 5-3/4 percent as under alternative C, would catch domestic and international markets

unawares. Money market yields would rise at least as much as the federal funds rate, if not

more. Intermediate- and longer-term yields could rise substantially as well, particularly if

market participants viewed the Federal Reserve's willingness to tighten in the face of ongoing

turmoil in Asian and other emerging markets as evidence that U.S. domestic macroeconomic

imbalances were seen to be large and that further restraint might well be in store. By

contrast, if the market viewed the tightening as a limited mid-course correction--perhaps

guided by the wording of the press release announcing the action--the sell-off in capital

markets might be modest. In any event, equity prices would fall, as investors reconciled



-21 -

themselves to both a higher rate on competing assets and a slower expansion of profits in the

future. Similarly, the dollar would tend to appreciate. If the action were not viewed as

presaging additional tightening in the United States and other industrial countries, the rise in

the dollar and pressure on foreign interest rates would be limited. With the exchange market

remaining skittish, large gains in the dollar against some currencies and further deterioration

in the financial markets of emerging market economies could not be ruled out.

(26) Consistent with the staffs projections of the annual growth of the monetary and

debt aggregates that were discussed in the previous section, some slowing in the expansion of

M2, M3, and debt is anticipated over the remainder of this year. The staff outlook, which

assumes the maintenance of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, projects that

M2 and M3 will grow at rates of about 4-1/4 percent and 7 percent respectively over the third

and fourth quarters, considerably below their pace so far this year, and that the growth of

domestic nonfinancial debt will edge down a notch. For the most part, this slowing in the

expansion of the money and debt aggregates mirrors the expected step-down in the growth of

nominal GDP in the second half of the year relative to the first. In addition, the growth of

the monetary aggregates should be held down by a waning or reversal of some of the special

factors that boosted them early in the year. Total debt growth should slow as the paydown of

securities by the federal government accelerates slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis and

borrowing by nonfederal sectors edges down. Maintenance of the slightly higher short-term

interest rates of alternative C would lower these growth rates only slightly over this year and

still leave both M2 and M3 above their annual ranges.

Directive Language

(27) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating to the

Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 1998-1999 and the operational paragraph for the

intermeeting period.

1998-1999 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS its meeting THE RANGES IT HAD

ESTABLISHED in February [DEL: established ranges] for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent

and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth

quarter of 1998. [IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT

THIS MEETING RAISED/LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN

FEBRUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO RANGES OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT

AND ____TO ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 1997 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1998.] The range for growth

of total domestic nonfinancial debt was MAINTAINED set at 3 to 7 percent (RAISED/

LOWERED TO ____ TO ____ PERCENT) for the year. FOR 1999, THE COMMITTEE

AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1998 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, OF ____ TO ____

PERCENT FOR M2 AND TO PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE

PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR GROWTH OF TOTAL

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT _ TO _ PERCENT FOR 1999. The behavior of



-23-

the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price

level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial

markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the

federal funds rate at/TO an average of around ____ [DEL: 5-l/2] percent. In the context of the

Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and

giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a

somewhat/SLIGHTLY higher federal funds rate would/MIGHT or a SOMEWHAT/slightly

lower federal funds rate WOULD/might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with [DEL: considerable moderation in

the] MODERATE growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

n.s. - not specified.
Footnotes on following page



1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth ofM1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was
5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited
effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more
actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased
M1-A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting,
the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the
adjusted ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted)
was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the
fourth quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for MI of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for MI of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for MI has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivitiy to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent This range was lowered
to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for
M3, and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2,
0 to 4 percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent This range was raised
to 2 to 6 percent at the July 1995 meeting.

14. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1997 QIV to June 1998 and for nonfinancial
debt are from 1997 QIV to May 1998.
