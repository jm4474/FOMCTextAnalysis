MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Credit concerns in U.S. and foreign financial markets intensified sharply 

during the intermeeting period, and liquidity in some markets was substantially 

impaired.  Heightened investor unease about exposure to subprime mortgages, and to 

structured credit products more generally, elicited a sharp rise in rates on asset-backed 

commercial paper (ABCP), as well as a notable shortening of ABCP maturities and a 

substantial contraction in ABCP issuance amid a sharp reduction in investor demand.  

Investors sought the safe haven of Treasury securities, while banks sought to increase 

their liquidity and were cautious about balance sheet capacity and counterparty 

exposure to ABCP.  Term interbank funding markets, particularly in Europe, but also 

in the United States, were significantly impaired, with rates rising well above expected 

future overnight rates and traders reporting a substantial drop in availability of term 

funding.  Although the Federal Reserve and some other central banks responded with 

a number of measures to increase liquidity early in the intermeeting period, strains 

mounted over the first few weeks of the interval and remain elevated.  In longer-term 

markets, broad U.S. equity prices edged up over the intermeeting period.  Yields on 

both investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds moved down, but 

spreads widened as rates on Treasury coupon securities fell even more.  Issuance of 

investment-grade corporate bonds was quite robust, but speculative-grade issuance 

remained weak, and the leveraged loan market stayed virtually shut.  In the housing 

finance sector, the spread between rates on jumbo fixed-rate mortgages and similar-

quality conforming loans widened to historical highs, while subprime mortgage loans 

remained unavailable.  The deterioration in financial conditions, along with some 



weaker-than-anticipated economic data, led investors to mark down the expected path 

for U.S. monetary policy significantly. 

Money Markets      

(2) The commercial paper market has been investors’ main focus during the 

intermeeting period.  Shortly after the August FOMC meeting, rates on overnight 

ABCP jumped in the United States and Europe after a French-based international 

bank suspended redemptions at some affiliated funds that had invested in mortgage-

related securities.  Rates on ABCP and on low-rated unsecured commercial paper 

have remained elevated since then, although yields on higher-rated unsecured 

commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms are 25 to 30 basis points lower than at 

the time of the August meeting.  Some CP issuers, particularly ABCP programs with 

exposure to non-conforming mortgages, have found it difficult to roll over maturing 

paper.  As a result, some issuers have drawn on backup lines at banks or taken the 

unprecedented step of exercising options to extend maturities of outstanding paper, 

and a few have defaulted.  Outstanding ABCP has contracted nearly 20 percent (not 

at an annual rate) since the week of the August FOMC meeting, and outstanding 

unsecured paper has fallen about 7 percent (Chart 1).  Moreover, banks reportedly 

have been purchasing and retaining some CP on their balance sheets.  Outstanding 

asset-backed euro commercial paper has contracted more than 10 percent.  Issuance 

of all types of CP has been concentrated at very short maturities, as investors remain 

leery of providing term funding, especially for asset-backed programs.  As investors 

sought to shift from riskier commercial paper to short-term Treasury securities, yields 

on three-month Treasury bills declined 80 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting 

period and were extremely volatile.  

(3) The spreading concern about ABCP led to a substantial firming in interbank 

overnight rates in the United States and abroad.  On August 9 the European Central

Bank (ECB) conducted an unscheduled tender operation, the beginning of a series of 

operations to provide liquidity.  The Desk also responded by providing reserves 

generously that day and the next, and the Federal Reserve announced it was providing 

liquidity to maintain orderly trading in the market.  (See box “Recent developments in 

reserve markets.”)  The central banks of Canada, Japan, Australia, Norway, and 

Switzerland all conducted special market operations over the following week to inject 

liquidity into overnight funding markets.    

(4) Despite these liquidity injections, dislocations in term interbank markets 

persisted.  On August 17, the Board approved a 50 basis point reduction in the 

primary credit rate and announced changes in discount window practices.  On two 

occasions later in the period, the ECB conducted special operations that provided a 

total of 115 billion euros on three-month terms.  Nonetheless, banks in the United 

States and overseas have continued to manage their assets and liabilities very 

cautiously, amid heightened pressures on their balance sheet capacity and counter- 

party credit risk.  (See box “Recent developments in term bank funding markets.”)   

Capital Markets 

(5) Conditions in corporate lending and securities markets have been mixed.  

Longer-term investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads have edged 

up somewhat, and CDX and LCDX spreads have changed little, on balance, since the 

August FOMC meeting.  Investment-grade corporate bond issuance was strong in 

August as yields declined, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was scant.  

Likewise, only a few small deals were reportedly syndicated in the leveraged loan 

market.  The pipeline of underwritten leveraged loan deals that have not yet been 

drawn remains large.  Banks reportedly plan to bring these loans to market this fall; 

uncertainty regarding prospects for those efforts as well as for the commercial paper 

market, however, appears to have contributed to the reluctance of commercial and

Recent Developments in Reserve Markets 

 In late July and early August, strains in European funding markets began to spill over to 
U.S. money markets.  Increasingly strong bidding by foreign banks pressured the federal funds 
rate higher, and on August 9 and 10, when these strains had become particularly acute, the Desk 
conducted substantial reserve-adding operations.  Indeed, on August 10, there were three 
operations, totaling $38 billion, including two well after the Desk’s usual morning intervention 
time, and the Federal Reserve announced that it was “providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly 
functioning of financial markets.”   

To help address market pressures in term markets, on Friday, August 17, the Federal 
Reserve temporarily narrowed the spread of the primary credit rate over the target federal funds 
rate to 50 basis points and made changes to the primary credit program to permit large as well as 
small depository institutions (DIs) to borrow for terms of up to thirty days, renewable at the 
borrower’s request.  Subsequently, several large banks publicly announced that they were 
borrowing from the discount window.  In addition, the Board granted a few large commercial 
banks exemptions from section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act in order to enable the banks to 
use discount window credit to fund loans to securities affiliates that hold substantial mortgage-
related assets.  

Collateral pledged to the discount window grew significantly over the intermeeting period as 
large DIs apparently sought to bolster their contingency funding sources.  Pledged collateral now 
exceeds $900 billion in lendable value, the highest level ever.  In response to inquiries from DIs, 
the Reserve Banks clarified their policy that investment-grade asset-backed commercial paper 
(ABCP) is acceptable as collateral.  As of September 13, ABCP pledges totaling roughly $10 
billion have been accepted, and DIs have submitted about eighty additional ABCP prospectuses 
for evaluation by Reserve Banks. 

Over the period, the Desk gradually shifted its conduct of open market operations to exert 
upward pressure on the federal funds rate to bring it closer to the target, and in the past week, 
reserve provision has been very restrained.  Indeed, on September 12, which was the last day of a 
reserve maintenance period, discount window borrowing jumped to over $7 billion.  While the 
funds rate was close to or a bit above target on a few days, it has been volatile both interday and 
intraday and has averaged noticeably below target.  Throughout this period, liquidity in the 
market for overnight fed funds has appeared ample, brokered volumes have reached record 
levels, and the market has seemed to be functioning well.  However, conditions in term funding 
markets remain impaired.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 5 of 49



  
Recent Developments in Term Bank Funding Markets 

 Conditions in term bank funding markets deteriorated substantially over the intermeeting 
period.  Many lenders have preferred to lend overnight to conserve liquidity, and institutions that 
are perceived as having particularly large exposure to risky assets such as ABCP, or as being less 
creditworthy more generally, have experienced significant difficulty securing term financing.  
Indeed, some large commercial banks report that, in recent weeks, term borrowing, in federal 
funds or Eurodollars, has been difficult or impossible.  According to discussions with market 
participants, the borrowers most directly affected seem to have been European banks, including 
their U.S. branches. 

Quoted term rates have been very elevated, with term premiums appearing to be 
significantly above typical levels.  As a consequence of these developments, banks’ funding in 
wholesale markets has become increasingly concentrated at overnight maturities, similar to 
developments in the commercial paper market.  Moreover, with term funding markets for 
dollars, euro, sterling, and other currencies impaired, the foreign exchange swap market also 
broke down.  Over the past week, however, market strains seem to have eased a bit, and banks 
have reported more trading taking place for tenors up to one month, albeit still at elevated rates. 

The breakdown in term funding markets appears attributable to several factors.  Banking 
institutions have become quite concerned that they may be required to provide funding for a 
large volume of leveraged loans and ABCP and are consequently conserving liquidity.   Banks 
also have reportedly become more concerned about counterparty credit exposures in light of 
elevated market volatility and latent losses on subprime mortgage products and related assets.  At 
least in part, tightness has persisted in the market because many banks have been unwilling to 
expand their balance sheets to arbitrage the spread.  Such reluctance may owe in part to concerns 
that they may approach regulatory capital ratios or capital ratios negotiated with rating agencies.  
And, given the current size of their balance sheets, banks may perceive other lending 
opportunities as more attractive.

investment banks to make major new balance sheet commitments.  Broad stock price 

indexes, though volatile, edged up over the intermeeting period.  Option-implied 

volatility on the S&P 500 spiked to the highest level since early 2003 but later 

subsided and was only a bit higher, on balance, over the period.   

(6) Markets for nonconforming mortgages were impaired over the intermeeting 

period, although the origination of conforming mortgages appears to have been 

largely unaffected by recent developments.  Securitization activity for non-prime and 

jumbo mortgages has been extremely limited in recent weeks, impeded by a near 

absence of demand from investors.  In response, nondepositories reportedly have 

substantially reduced their originations of jumbo mortgages, but some banks and 

thrifts report that they are offering prime borrowers jumbo mortgages at higher rates 

and holding the resulting assets on their balance sheets.  Some mortgage borrowers 

who would have been classified as subprime a year ago are reportedly using private 

mortgage insurance to qualify for conforming loans, although this segment of 

borrowers is likely finding credit expensive and difficult to obtain.   

Market Functioning  

(7) Trading conditions in some securities markets were strained over the 

intermeeting period.  Treasury bill market functioning was notably impaired at times, 

with bid-asked spreads extremely wide by historical standards.  The demand for 

Treasury collateral increased sharply in the repo market, and overnight general 

collateral (GC) repo rates were far below the federal funds rate for a few days.  

However, the temporary reduction from 100 to 50 basis points in the minimum fee 

for borrowing securities from the SOMA Securities Lending Facility, announced on 

August 21, reportedly played some role in improving conditions in the bill and repo 

markets; the spread between the overnight federal funds rate and the corresponding 

GC repo rate has since returned to more normal levels.  The secondary market for 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 7 of 49



Treasury coupon securities has also shown some signs of stress, but conditions have 

not been nearly as problematic as in the bill market.  Bid-asked spreads for Treasury 

coupon securities have been somewhat above their average levels of recent years, but 

trading volumes have been high.  On-the-run liquidity premiums for two- and ten-

year Treasury securities have stayed elevated.  Two-year swap spreads increased 

substantially over the intermeeting period, although those at the ten-year horizon fell a 

bit, perhaps held down in recent days in part by mortgage convexity hedging 

demands.  Disruptions to both U.S. and European term interbank funding markets 

also affected the foreign exchange swap market, where bid-asked spreads rose to as 

much as twenty times their normal levels, and trade sizes reportedly were much 

smaller than usual.  In contrast, conditions in the CDS market have improved over 

the intermeeting period, especially for index products, and the secondary market for 

corporate bonds also functioned well, with bid-asked spreads within their historical 

range. 

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(8) Investors marked down the expected near-term policy path significantly 

during the intermeeting period, evidently in response to ongoing disruptions in short-

term credit markets and a few key data releases (Chart 2).  The FOMC’s decision at its 

August 7 meeting to leave the federal funds rate target unchanged at 5¼ percent, the 

accompanying statement, and the minutes of that meeting were about in line with 

market expectations, and reactions in financial markets were muted.  None of the 

statements or actions by the Federal Reserve on August 10 or August 17 elicited large 

initial responses in short-term interest rates.  However, further disappointing news on 

the housing sector and, especially, the drop in August payrolls and sizable downward 

revisions to payrolls in June and July revealed in the latest employment report 

appeared to solidify market expectations for a near-term policy easing.

(9) Investors generally expect either a quarter- or half-point cut in the funds 

rate at the upcoming meeting.  Binary options on the target funds rate after the 

September meeting suggest that investors now assign about 35 percent odds to a 50 

basis point reduction in the target and approximately 50 percent odds to a 25 basis 

point cut.  According to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, which was conducted 

after the release of the employment report, respondents assign about 40 percent odds 

to a 50 basis point reduction and about 55 percent odds to a 25 basis point cut.  

Survey participants also anticipate substantial revision to the FOMC statement, with 

many expecting the Committee to cite downside risks to growth as the dominating 

concern.  The primary dealers marked down their expected path for the funds rate as 

well; their average anticipated target at the end of next year is now 4½ percent.  

Futures quotes suggest that investors expect as much as 125 basis points of easing by 

the end of next year, almost 50 basis points more than at the time of the last FOMC 

meeting and somewhat more than the primary dealers.  Estimates of the expected 

path of monetary policy based on market quotes are more uncertain than usual given 

that term premiums in many short-term financial markets have likely increased but by 

amounts that are difficult to gauge.  Moreover, money market options indicate that 

uncertainty about the path of the funds rate has soared, with the width of 90 percent 

confidence intervals around the anticipated funds rate six and twelve months ahead 

touching multiyear highs.  The skew of the implied distribution of expected funds 

rates at those horizons remains notably negative. 

(10) Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 35 basis points, on net, 

over the intermeeting period, roughly in line with the revision in policy expectations.  

Ten-year nominal yields fell about 25 basis points to 4½ percent, the lowest level in a 

year.  TIPS-based inflation compensation at the five-year horizon was about 

unchanged, despite the rise in spot oil prices, while the five-year forward measure 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 49



ending in ten years rose 10 basis points.  The Reuters/Michigan survey suggests that 

households’ short- and long-term inflation expectations ticked down in August.  

Foreign Developments 

(11) In major industrial countries other than the United States, yields on 

government bonds fell 10 to 30 basis points, as expectations of monetary tightening 

were scaled back (Chart 3).  The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and 

the Bank of Japan did not raise their policy rates, contrary to expectations at the start 

of the intermeeting period.  However, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Riksbank, 

and the Swiss National Bank increased policy rates 25 basis points.  The foreign 

exchange value of the dollar fell about 1½ percent against the major currencies over 

the intermeeting period.  The yen rose more than 2½ percent, on net, while the 

Australian dollar fell 1¾ percent, reflecting a pullback from the carry trade.1  Broad 

equity indexes recorded only small net changes in Europe and Canada but dropped 

more than 8 percent in Japan.   

(12) Recent market turbulence has been less pronounced in most emerging 

markets than in the industrial economies.  Equity prices recorded strong gains in some 

Asian markets, led by a 13 percent increase in China.  Stock prices were little changed 

or down in Latin America and Eastern Europe.  Dollar-denominated bond spreads in 

major emerging markets and local-currency bond yields were little changed except in 

Brazil, where yields rose about 60 basis points.  The Chinese renminbi appreciated 

more than ¾ percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period, but most other 

emerging-market currencies depreciated, leaving the dollar essentially unchanged on 

average against the currencies of our other important trading partners.

Debt and Money 

(13) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to be expanding at 

an annual rate of almost 7 percent in the current quarter, similar to the second-quarter 

pace (Chart 4).  Nonfinancial business debt likely expanded robustly in August, 

supported by a strong rebound in bond issuance by investment-grade companies and 

a jump in C&I loans.  In part, the recent surge in C&I loans reflected disbursements 

of LBO-related loans that arranging banks have been unable to syndicate to non-bank 

investors.  C&I loans may also have been boosted by decisions by some firms to 

substitute bank loans for commercial paper.  Consumer credit continued to expand at 

a moderate pace through July.  Household mortgage borrowing is estimated to have 

slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting decelerating house prices, the slower 

pace of home sales, and the tighter credit conditions facing some mortgage borrowers.   

(14) A surge in liquid deposits and a jump in retail money market mutual funds 

boosted M2 growth to a 10½ percent annual rate in August.  The strong inflows into 

money funds likely reflected portfolio shifts in response to recent financial market 

developments, as households pulled back from equity and fixed income mutual funds.  

Government-only money funds, which hold nothing but Treasury and agency 

securities and repurchase agreements, attracted a disproportionately large share of 

inflows in August as a whole.  However, flows to such funds appear to have abated 

somewhat in recent days.  Flows into liquid deposits also picked up in August, 

presumably as investors shied away from turbulent financial markets.  Some 

institutions appeared to have stepped up their bids for small time deposits in recent 

weeks.

Economic Outlook through 2009 

(15) Although spending data have come in about as expected over the 

intermeeting period, anecdotal reports on real activity in recent weeks have been 

downbeat, the August employment report was weaker than expected and conditions 

in mortgage and other credit markets have tightened appreciably.  As a result, the staff 

has marked down substantially its projection for aggregate demand and lowered its 

assumption for the path of monetary policy over coming quarters.  The forecast now 

assumes that the Committee will cut the target for the funds rate to 4¾ percent by the 

October meeting and will then hold the stance of policy unchanged through the end 

of the forecast period.  As the staff assumes less easing of monetary policy than 

apparently anticipated by investors, longer-term Treasury yields are expected to firm a 

bit over the forecast period.  Equity prices are, as usual, assumed to rise at the 6½ 

percent annual rate required to put them at parity with Treasury securities on a risk-

adjusted basis, and the real foreign exchange value of the dollar is expected to 

depreciate a little less than 2 percent per year.  Spot oil prices are expected to edge 

lower, in line with futures market quotes.  Against this backdrop, real GDP is forecast 

to expand at a 2½ percent annual rate in the current quarter, but to slow to an annual 

rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter before picking up to around 1¾ percent in 

2008.  This outlook is a good bit weaker than in the previous forecast and envisions 

actual GDP growing more slowly than potential on average.  This Greenbook extends 

the forecast through 2009; in that year real GDP growth is projected to pick up to a 

pace slightly above that of potential GDP.  In this forecast, the staff has revised down 

its estimate of the NAIRU from 5 percent to 4¾ percent in light of the recent 

behavior of inflation and labor costs.  This revision implies an increase in the staff’s 

estimate of the level―but not the projected growth rate―of potential output.  The 

unemployment rate is now seen as edging up to nearly 5 percent in 2009.  With the 

unemployment path marked up slightly from the previous Greenbook, and the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 15 of 49



estimate of the NAIRU having been revised down, the staff now envisions the 

emergence of some slack in labor and product markets and has consequently marked 

down its inflation forecast a bit.  Core PCE inflation is forecast to average 2 percent 

in the second half of this year before edging down to just under 2 percent in the next 

two years.  With energy prices decelerating, total PCE inflation is projected to average 

close to 2 percent in the second half of this year and to fall to around 1¾ percent in 

2008 and 2009. 

Update on Medium-Term Strategies 

(16) This section provides an update of the materials on medium-term strategies 

for monetary policy that were presented in the August Bluebook.  As shown in Chart 

5, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* has been revised downward by 

about 50 basis points and now stands at 2.8 percent, about 60 basis points below the 

actual real federal funds rate.2  This downward revision largely reflects the staff’s 

assessment of the implications for aggregate demand of the recent financial 

turbulence, which has increased the cost of credit to many borrowers, diminished the 

availability of specific types of mortgage funding, weakened the outlook for house 

prices, contributed to a fall in consumer confidence, and worsened the prospects for 

foreign real activity.  In addition, anecdotal information and some of the statistical 

data that pertain directly to the period since the onset of financial turbulence have 

been downbeat.  The three model-based estimates of short-run r* range from 1.8 to 

2.6 percent, about the same range as in the August Bluebook; it should be noted  

that these three measures do not incorporate current-quarter information or 

                                           
2  For the current quarter, the actual real rate is constructed as the difference between the 
nominal funds rate target as of the Bluebook publication date and the average core PCE 
inflation rate over the past year.

judgmental adjustments and hence do not reflect the recent deterioration in financial 

market conditions.   

(17) Chart 6 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using the 

Greenbook forecast and its extension beyond 2009.3  In these simulations, 

policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified 

goal, on keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding 

changes in the nominal funds rate.4  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand 

set of charts), the optimal control simulation prescribes a nominal federal funds rate 

path that rises slightly to about 5½ percent over the next few quarters and then 

declines to about 3¾ percent by the end of 2012.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent 

(the right-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate declines nearly a full percentage 

point over the next few quarters to a plateau somewhat below 4½ percent.  Under 

both specifications of the inflation goal, the prescriptions for policy through 2010 are 

½ to ¾ percentage point lower than in August, primarily reflecting the downward 

revision to aggregate demand.  The path of the unemployment rate over the next 

several years in each simulation is little changed from the previous Bluebook, while 

the subsequent decline reflects the downward revision of the staff’s assessment of the 

                                           
3  The characteristics of the extension are described in the memo to the Committee by Jean-
Philippe Laforte, “The Extended Greenbook Forecast,” September 12, 2007. 
4  The FRB/US model is specified at a quarterly frequency and utilizes the quarterly average 
value of the federal funds rate.  Therefore, in representing the interest rate smoothing 
motive in optimal policy simulations, it is necessary to account for the timing of the FOMC 
meeting within the initial quarter of the simulation (2007Q3 in the current Bluebook) 
because a funds rate change late in the quarter has a smaller effect on the average funds  
rate than if the same change had occurred earlier in the quarter.  Starting with this Bluebook, 
this consideration is captured in the optimal policy simulations by assigning a greater penalty 
to an interest rate change in the initial quarter of the simulation compared with the penalty 
on interest rate changes in subsequent quarters; the increase in the penalty depends on the 
relative timing of the FOMC meeting within the quarter.  The paths shown in Chart 6 for 
the August Bluebook are those actually shown in the previous Bluebook and were computed 
under the previous procedure, which did not impose any increased penalty for interest rate 
changes in the initial quarter of each simulation.

NAIRU.  The paths for core PCE inflation through 2010 are slightly lower than in 

August. 

(18) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes a 

funds rate path that declines to about 4¼ percent in the second half of 2008—about 

¾ percentage point lower than in the August Bluebook—and then rises about  

50 basis points through the rest of the decade.  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US 

model indicate a 70 percent probability that the funds rate will be in a range of 3 to 6 

percent at the end of next year.5  Financial market participants’ expectations regarding 

the funds rate path from 2008 through 2012 appear to have declined about  

½ percentage point over the intermeeting period, roughly the same amount as the 

decline in the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*.  This suggests that 

market participants’ assessment of the strength of the economy may have been 

marked down by an amount similar to that in the staff outlook.  Interest rate caps 

indicate that the lower bound of the 70 percent confidence interval for the funds rate 

at the end of 2008 is now at about 3 percent, consistent with some other evidence 

suggesting that market participants perceive a substantial likelihood of very slow 

growth or even a recession over the year ahead.  Prescriptions from simple policy 

rules are about ¼ to ½ percentage point lower than in the previous Bluebook. 

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(19) This Bluebook presents four policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Language that was not shown in the either of 

the Committee’s August FOMC statements is shown in red, while wording from the 

unscheduled August 17 statement is colored blue.  The statements from the August 7 

and 17 FOMC meetings are shown on page 23.  Under Alternatives A and B, the 

                                           
5  The width of these confidence intervals is determined by the past two decades of 
estimated model residuals and hence does not change in response to incoming data.

recent weeks, leading to tighter credit 
and an intensification of the housing 
correction.  These developments have 
the potential to restrain growth in 
economic activity.  Nonetheless, the 
economy seems likely to continue to 
expand at a moderate pace over coming 
quarters, supported by solid growth 
outside the housing sector and a robust 
global economy.

2. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year. Financial

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the 
Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will 
fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the 
outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming 
information. 

In these circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has 
continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee 
judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably. The 
Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to 
mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in 
financial markets. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 49



Committee would lower the target federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4¾ percent.  

Alternative A would characterize the downside risks to growth as outweighing upside 

risks to inflation, while Alternative B would not provide an assessment of the overall 

balance of risks.  Under Alternative C, the policy rate would be lowered 25 basis 

points to 5 percent, and the statement would indicate that the downside risks to 

economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation.  Alternative D would leave 

the target rate unchanged at 5¼ percent and report that the risks to growth and 

inflation are roughly balanced.  As for the rationale portion of the statement, 

Alternatives A, B, and C substantially modify the August 7 assessment of the outlook 

for growth and of the risks around that outlook in light of credit and housing market 

developments, using some of the wording from the August 17 statement.  In contrast, 

Alternative D recognizes the deterioration in financial conditions but repeats the 

judgment that moderate growth is likely over coming quarters.  Inflation readings 

have continued to be benign but have not improved further over the past several 

months.  Accordingly, under all four alternatives, the statement that inflation readings 

have improved “in recent months” is changed to shift the time reference for the 

improvement in inflation to “this year.”  In addition, under the first three alternatives, 

the inflation assessment is modified to observe that “some inflation risks remain” and 

that the Committee will “monitor inflation developments carefully,” but the reference 

to pressures on resource utilization is deleted.  This may be appropriate if the 

Committee is now a bit more confident that the continued favorable inflation 

readings represent a permanent moderation in inflation and if it shares the staff view 

of the degree of pressure in the labor market.  In Alternative D, the inflation 

assessment is unchanged from the August 7 statement.  As usual, the Committee 

could consider combining elements from more than one alternative.  

(20) Financial conditions have deteriorated sharply on balance since the  

August 7 FOMC meeting, making it more difficult and costly for households to 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 49



obtain nonconforming mortgages and also leading to tighter credit conditions for 

some firms.  In addition, some nonfinancial indicators, including the August 

employment report, pending home sales, and anecdotal reports from contacts in 

private industry, suggest a weaker near-term outlook.  In view of these developments, 

the Committee may judge that prospects for economic activity have deteriorated 

notably, and that the risk of a substantial and protracted slowdown in economic 

growth is now unacceptably large.  With such an outlook, and with inflation data 

continuing to be benign, members might see it as appropriate to counter the effect of 

tighter financial conditions by easing policy by 50 basis points at this meeting, as in 

Alternative B.  If members judge that evolving circumstances will likely warrant 

easing policy by 50 basis points or more over the next several months, as in the staff 

forecast, then they might think it prudent to implement a half-percentage-point cut at 

this meeting.  The real federal funds rate is now about 50 basis points above its 

Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value (Chart 5) and is also above the range of 

model-based equilibrium estimates, suggesting that a half-point easing in policy is 

unlikely to lead to unacceptable pressures on resources.  A 50 basis point rate cut is 

also consistent with the prescriptions of a number of simple policy rules, even with a 

1½ percent inflation objective (Chart 7).  A relatively aggressive easing of policy might 

also be viewed as valuable insurance against the risk of a further slide in investor and 

consumer confidence or a possible further deterioration in financial market 

conditions.  Should such fears ultimately prove to be unfounded, and financial 

markets and the outlook for the economy improve, the Committee might believe that 

it could act quickly to take back some or all of the easing.   

(21) The draft language of Alternative B repeats the observation from the 

August 7 FOMC statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of 

the year.  However, it drops the assessment from the August 17 statement that 

“recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace,” 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 49



as information that has subsequently become available suggests greater weakness in 

activity.  It then adapts language from the August 17 statement to note the potential 

dampening effect of financial market turmoil on the housing market and the growth 

outlook more generally.  The statement observes that the rate cut is intended to 

forestall the effects of these developments on the economy and to promote moderate 

growth “over time.”  This wording leaves open the possibility that growth may be 

weak for a time but suggests that the longer-term outlook remains healthy.  

Alternative B refrains from making any explicit characterization of the balance of 

risks, stating that “The Committee will continue to closely follow timely indicators of 

economic prospects and will act as needed” to attain its dual objectives.  Although 

this sentence does not literally express any asymmetry, analysts are likely to read the 

statement overall as indicating some predelication to ease policy further.  This 

approach could be seen as giving the Committee flexibility going forward, either to 

ease further in response to soft incoming data or to stand pat if the economy appears 

to be stabilizing.  If members find Alternative B attractive, but wish to adopt an 

explicit statement of balanced risks, then they might insert the sentence “After today’s 

action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now 

roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation” at the start of the assessment of risk 

paragraph.  

(22) Measuring market expectations is especially challenging in the current 

environment, but investors appear to place substantial odds on two possible target 

rate decisions at this meeting―a quarter-point cut and a half-point cut―and seem to 

envision cumulative easing of 75 to 100 basis points by the end of this year.  With 

Alternative B putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some 

possibility of further rate cuts, this alternative would likely prompt a modest decline in

little.  The effect on equity, credit, and term funding markets would depend on how 

investors interpreted the decision.  They would most likely conclude that the sizable 

policy response may offset some of the macroeconomic effects of credit market 

turmoil, leading equity prices to rally and risk spreads to narrow.  But it is possible 

that the relatively large policy move and the statement could lead investors to infer 

that the growth outlook is weaker than they had previously thought, having the 

opposite effect.  Going forward, the reference to the Committee closely following 

timely indicators may sharpen the sensitivity of markets to near-term and forward-

looking economic data.  

(23) If members are particularly pessimistic about the growth outlook, or see 

the downside risks as especially large, then they may prefer to both ease 50 basis 

points and explicitly point to downside risks in order to maximize the scope for 

further near-term policy action, as envisioned in Alternative A.  Members might view 

the current configuration of asset prices and credit spreads as possibly presaging a 

sharp slowdown in growth or even a recession.  (See box “Financial indicators of 

recession risk.”)  The Committee may be concerned that the housing correction could 

be more severe than anticipated by the staff, as explored in the “Greater housing 

correction” alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  Members may also worry that a 

serious credit crunch could be emerging with economic consequences of the sort 

explored in the Greenbook “Bank capital crunch” scenario.  If asset-backed 

commercial paper programs draw even more heavily on bank backup liquidity lines 

and banks come to hold a large volume of leveraged loans and mortgages on their 

balance sheets, banks may tighten terms and standards for lending to households and 

businesses in order to conserve liquidity and balance sheet capacity.  Continued 

market volatility or the emergence of news of losses could lead to solvency concerns 

about one or more major market participants, which would likely worsen counterparty 

credit concerns and interbank funding problems.  The Committee may consider these

Financial Indicators of Recession Risk 
 
Some financial market observers consider the slope of the 
Treasury yield curve to be a useful predictor of future 
macroeconomic conditions.  The yield curve had been inverted 
or flat until June and recently has steepened somewhat; thus, by 
that measure, the risk of recession appears to have diminished in 
recent months.  However, spreads between corporate yields and 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields also have had considerable 
statistical power in predicting recent recessions.  Some of those 
credit spreads have surged over the past month to levels 
comparable to those reached in 1989 and 2000.  Thus, markets 
may be signaling high odds of imminent macroeconomic 
deterioration, despite the steepening of the Treasury yield curve. 
 
Combining term and credit spreads in a logistic regression 
produces a model that performs well in “predicting” the last two 
recessions one year ahead while at the same time minimizing the 
number of false positives—that is, predictions of recessions that 
did not occur.  Different measures of term and credit spreads 
produce slightly different results in this model, but a good fit is 
achieved—over the 1988 through 2006 estimation period—by 
using the spread on AA-rated five-year corporate bonds and the 
difference between ten- and two-year Treasury yields.1  The 
August 2007 average values of these variables suggest a 
probability of about 40 percent that the U.S. economy will be in 
a recession in August 2008.  This is the largest probability that 
the model has produced since late 2000, and it is up from 
virtually zero earlier in the year.  If spreads during the first part 
of September were to persist for the remainder of the month, 
the estimated probability would rise to over 80 percent. 
 
The apparently heightened risk of recession is notable, but some 
caveats are in order.  In particular, given the rather 
unprecedented nature of recent developments, it is possible that 
the term and credit spreads currently reflect different factors 
than they did prior to the previous two recessions.  Moreover, 
the AA spread has risen more dramatically than some other 
credit spreads in recent weeks.  For example, high-yield bond 
spreads remained near their historical averages and thus 
continued to suggest less than 10 percent odds of a recession as 
of August.  Although high-yield spreads have not previously 
performed as well in predicting business cycles as AA spreads, 
the sensitivity of the prediction to which credit spread is used 
indicates that the recent readings should be interpreted with care. 
 
 
1 Specifically, these two variables forecast recent recessions and expansions at 
least as well as alternative measures of term and credit spreads, based on both 
in- and out-of-sample tests.  See King, T. B.; Levin, A. T; and Perli, R., 
“Financial Market Perceptions of Recession Risk.”  Working paper, July 2007. 
 

  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 49



risks sufficiently palpable to warrant a downward tilt to the balance of risks even after 

a half-point rate cut. 

(24) The draft statement for Alternative A is similar to that for Alternative B, 

but with four main differences.  First, the reference to economic growth having been 

moderate in the first half of the year is deleted, as this may be seen as no longer 

relevant to the outlook, given the abrupt shift in circumstances.  Second, Alternative 

A states that credit conditions and the housing correction “appear likely to exert 

appreciable restraint” on growth, which is stronger than the statement that they have 

“the potential  . . .  to restrain economic growth.”  Third, in addition to giving a more 

gloomy modal assessment of the growth outlook, the draft language also cites the 

potential for significant financial spillovers to business and household spending as 

posing downside risks to that outlook.  Finally, the draft for Alternative A is explicit 

that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation.     

(25) A 50 basis point rate cut and the adoption of the statement language in 

Alternative A would cause short-term interest rates to decline appreciably, as investors 

would be somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the policy action and would also 

infer that policy probably would be eased further.  Longer-term interest rates likely 

would decline modestly and the dollar would depreciate.  As with Alternative B, the 

effect on equity, credit and term funding markets is ambiguous, but the negative 

growth outlook in this alternative might well spook investors and cause stock prices 

to fall and risk spreads to rise. 

(26) The Greenbook forecast is predicated on an assumption of a quarter-point 

easing in policy at this meeting and a second easing at the October meeting.  If the 

Committee finds the staff forecast to be both plausible and likely to be the best 

attainable outcome under the current difficult circumstances, then it may choose to 

ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement pointing to downside 

risks to the outlook, as in Alternative C.  Members may judge that the growth 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 29 of 49



outlook has deteriorated, but might not be convinced that the downside risks are 

sufficient to justify a 50 basis point easing at this meeting.  Also, they may be unsure 

of the magnitude of the macroeconomic fallout from recent financial turmoil, and 

prefer to await more information before responding further.  Indeed, they may think 

that financial market conditions could improve quickly, along the lines of the “Faster 

rebound” Greenbook alternative simulation.  That view may be reinforced by the 

general resilience of equity prices in the face of credit market disruptions, a pattern 

that does not seem consistent with a serious financial crisis being underway.  

Members may also be concerned that a half-point easing in monetary policy at this 

time would be misconstrued by some investors as a sign that the Committee was 

responding directly to asset prices, potentially exacerbating moral hazard by 

encouraging excessive risk taking among market participants in the future.  Moreover, 

some members may be concerned that investors could perceive a half-point easing at 

this meeting as signaling a downweighting of the Committee’s price stability objective.  

If so, they may prefer to implement a more modest cut in rates at this time while 

expressing the judgment that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks 

to inflation, even after the policy easing.  Members may find this option especially 

attractive if they are concerned about the speed with which the Committee could 

reverse a larger rate cut should financial markets stabilize sooner than currently 

expected. A quarter-point easing in policy at this meeting is also in line with the 

prescription from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation goal (Chart 6).  

(27) In the draft statement accompanying Alternative C, the assessment of the 

outlook for growth and inflation would be identical to that in Alternative B, but the 

balance of risks would point to the downside.    

(28) With investors placing considerable weight on a 50 basis point cut at this 

meeting, the adoption of Alternative C would probably cause short-term interest rates 

to rise somewhat, even though the downside balance of risks would suggest that 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 49



further easing could well be forthcoming.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar 

would likely appreciate modestly.  With the Federal Reserve perhaps perceived as 

inclined to respond only gradually to the evolving circumstances―an impression that 

might be amplified by the Committtee’s assessment that the risks are tilted to the 

downside―investors might mark down their outlook for economic growth, leading 

long-term yields and equity prices to fall and spreads in credit markets to widen 

somewhat. 

(29) Members may be especially concerned about the dangers of overreacting 

to financial market developments and may not be convinced that the recent credit 

market turmoil will persist or have large macroeconomic implications.  And, with the 

unemployment rate unchanged since the August FOMC meeting, productivity having 

decelerated considerably, core PCE inflation still close to 2 percent, and crude oil 

prices surging to record levels, some members may continue to be quite concerned 

about the inflation outlook.  If so, they may prefer to leave policy unchanged at this 

meeting.  An unchanged stance of policy, coupled with an assessment that the risks 

have moved into balance, as envisioned in Alternative D, would allow the Committee 

more time to gauge the need for policy adjustments while leaving the flexibility for 

policy to be eased at the next meeting, if such a move appears necessary at that time.  

Members may be particularly attracted to this alternative if they see a risk that a 

premature easing of policy could cause long-run inflation expectations to drift 

upwards.  Indeed, optimal policy simulations with a 1½ percent inflation goal (Chart 

6) suggest that policy should actually be tightened further at some point this year. 

(30) The draft statement accompanying Alternative D retains the observation 

that economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year.  It adopts 

language from the August 17 statement about recent financial developments and 

notes that such developments have the potential to restrain growth, but indicates that 

weakness in residential investment is likely to be offset by solid growth in other 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 31 of 49



sectors of the economy and concludes that the economy is nonetheless likely to 

continue to expand at a moderate pace.  The inflation paragraph is barely changed 

from the August 7 statement, and the reference to pressures on resources is retained, 

suggesting that nothing has changed to diminish concerns about inflation.  Given the 

potential for financial developments to restrain growth and the essentially unchanged 

inflation picture, the Committee would conclude that the risks to growth and inflation 

are now roughly balanced. 

(31) Although investors do not completely rule out an unchanged target funds 

rate at this meeting, the adoption of Alternative D would come as a considerable 

surprise.  Short-term interest rates would surely rise, and it is likely that equity prices 

would fall substantially and the Treasury yield curve would flatten, particularly if 

market participants marked up the odds of slow growth or a recession in light of the 

decision to leave policy unchanged. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(32) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to average about 

4½ percent at an annualized rate over the second half of 2007 and to continue to 

expand at roughly that rate in 2008 and 2009.  The projected growth rate of M2 

through the end of this year is a bit faster than in the August Greenbook, reflecting 

the easier path of policy now assumed.  

(33) After having expanded at an annualized rate of 7½ percent in the first half 

of the year, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to decelerate to a 6¼ 

percent pace in the second half and about 5 percent in both 2008 and 2009.  The 

weaker outlook for the housing sector this round has led the staff to project a steeper 

decline in household borrowing than in the August forecast.  Corporate debt growth 

is expected to slow later this year as the pace of merger and acquisition activity falls 

back from its recent elevated level.  Owing to recent financial market stress, the

forecast for the level of commercial paper outstanding has been revised down in the 

second half of the year but, offsetting this, the forecast for bank loans and corporate

coming quarters.  Corporate bond spreads are forecast to edge down from their 

current levels, but to remain higher than they were earlier this year throughout the

moderately and those on mortgage loans to be substantially tighter for some 

borrowers for an extended period.

Directive and Balance of Risks Statement  

Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those presented 

in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO 

an average of around ________ 5¼ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

 A.   Even after today’s action, the Committee judges that the downside risks 

to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation.  Future 

policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and 

economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  

 B.   The Committee will continue to closely follow timely indicators of 

economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and 

sustainable economic growth.   

 C.   Even after today’s action, the Committee judges that the downside risks 

to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation. Future policy 

adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic 

growth, as implied by incoming information. 

 D.   In the current circumstances, the Committee judges that the downside 

risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks

both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming 

information.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Appendix C Chart 8

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
