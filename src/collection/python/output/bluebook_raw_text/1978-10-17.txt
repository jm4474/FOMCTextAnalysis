Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 growth surged to a 14.1 per cent annual rate in

September, but appears to be slowing in October on the basis of data

for the early part of the month. Over September and October M-1 is

now projected to rise at about a 9 per cent rate, at the upper end of

the FOMC's range. M-2 appears to be increasing at about a 10 per cent

annual rate in the September-October period, just below the upper end

of the FOMC's range. Both savings and small time deposits grew sur-

prisingly rapidly at banks in September, and growth in total deposits

at thrift institutions accelerated further to about a 15-1/2 per cent

annual rate. Sales of the new money market certificates by banks and

thrift institutions remained large last month, in total matching the

August pace.

(2) Following the September FOMC meeting, incoming data

suggested that M-1 growth would be around the upper end, and M-2 growth



-2-

in the upper half, of their respective short-run ranges. The Account

Management responded by raising its Federal funds rate objective to

8-3/4 per cent, the upper end of the Committee's range. The discount

rate was raised 1/4 point to 8 per cent on September 22 and was again

raised to 8-1/2 per cent after the close of business Friday, October 13.

Member bank borrowing has averaged from $1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion during

the past three statement weeks.

(3) Prior to the latest discount rate increase, most short-

term interest rates had increased another 20 to 50 basis points from

the September FOMC meeting, as the market reacted to the further

increases in the Federal funds rate and to the continued strength in

published monetary aggregate data. The 3-month Treasury bill rate,

however, dropped back sharply to around 7-3/4 per cent--below its level

at the time of the September meeting--as foreign demand for bills were

relatively strong and the Treasury continued to emphasize 6-month bills

in the regular weekly refundings. In after-hours trading on Friday,

following the latest discount rate action, Treasury bill rates rose 10

to 15 basis points.

(4) Yields on long-term Treasury and corporate securities

also moved higher over the inter-meeting period--generally by 20 to 30

basis points as of the close of business on Friday--as interest rate

expectations appeared to shift in response not only to the further rise

in short rates, but also to the persistence of rapid inflation and to

signs that economic activity might be stronger over coming months than

some had anticipated. These recent increases left long-term Treasury



and corporate yields somewhat below their highs for the current expan-

sion reached in mid-July, even though the funds rate had risen 100

basis points since that time. In contrast to yields on other long-

term bonds, yields on municipal issues remained essentially unchanged

during recent weeks, owing in part to a sharp decline in advance

refundings by State and local units.

(5) Growth in commercial bank credit picked up somewhat in

September, as investments and security loans rose after declining in

August. Real estate and business loans expanded at just below the

average rates observed since late spring, and the bank prime rate

rose to 10 per cent. Average rates charged by S&Ls on new home loan

commitments also have edged up of late, despite enlarged deposits flows

and reduced borrowing from Home Loan Banks, as the cost of obtaining

funds through the 6-month money market certificate has risen further.

Mortgage credit demands apparently remain strong, and loan takedowns

and commitments rose at S&Ls in August.

of change in related monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary

aggregates over the one-year QIII '78 to QIII '79 period are shown

below for Committee consideration. M-1 ranges shown in the top line

reflect staff estimates of the expected shift from demand deposits to

savings deposits over the year ahead as a result of the introduction of

the automatic transfer service (ATS) on November 1, while M-1 ranges

that abstract from the estimated impact of ATS are shown in parentheses

in the second line. The upper limits of the ranges on the top line are

noticeably lower than those on the second line because the staff

believes that some significant shift from demand to savings deposits

as a result of ATS will almost assuredly occur, as explained in paragraph

8; the ranges of the top line are relatively wide to allow for the

uncertain size of this shift. Alternative B is based on the same growth

rate range for M-1 as adopted by the Committee in July for the QII '78

to QII '79 period, while alternatives A and C encompass, respectively,

more and less expansion of M-1. For reasons to be discussed later, the

M-2 and M-3 ranges in nearly all cases have been raised relative to

current ranges.

(8) Over the QIII '78-QIII '79 policy period, the staff

projects that ATS would reduce M-1 growth by between 1½ and 4½

percentage points. The upper end of this range assumes that some-

thing less than 20 per cent of the nearly $95 billion of eligible demand

deposits shift to savings deposits in the first year of ATS, while the

lower end assumes something less than 10 per cent shifts. While

uncertainties are, of course, vast, the upper end of the range is

comparable to first year experience with NOW accounts in the four New

England states that were permitted to offer such accounts in early

1976. Transfers under present circumstances may be slower because

of the absence of competition from thrifts, which was present in

New England. However, it would appear that bank pricing of the ATS

will make such service quite attractive for large deposit holders, who

account for a major share of eligible deposits.

(9) Given the degree of uncertainty regarding the size

of the distortion in M-1 produced by automatic transfers, the staff

also proposes that the Committee consider the desirability of

supplementing, at least for a transition period, the other monetary

measures with the aggregate "M-l+", which will not be affected by

shifts between demand and savings deposits at banks and should

provide useful collateral evidence about the strength of the

1/
transactions demand for money.- This aggregate--defined as M-1

plus savings deposits at commercial banks, NOW accounts at thrifts,

credit union share drafts, and demand deposits at MSB's--was discussed

in appendix V of the September Bluebook. The addendum to the table

1/ It would, of course, be affected by shifts from deposits at
savings institutions to commercial bank ATS accounts. Such shifts
should be relatively modest. We have assumed a shift of $2 billion,
which adds .4 of a percentage point to growth in M-1+ over the
QIII '78-QIII '79 period.



in paragraph (7) shows M-1+ ranges thought to be consistent with the

other aggregates.

(10) The demand for transactions balances is expected to

remain quite strong over the new QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period,

with nominal GNP projected to rise at almost an 11 per cent annual

rate. Thus, a further rise in the Federal funds rate appears needed

under alternatives B and C if growth in the aggregates is to be held

within their ranges. Even under alternative A, some further increase in

the funds rate might well be required. Staff projections of the funds

rate for each alternative are shown in appendix I.

(11) Under alternative B, we would expect the Federal funds

rate to level off in a 9 to 10¼ per cent range by early next year if

M-1 growth over the QIII '78-QIII '79 period is to be at around the

upper end of a 4 to 6½ per cent range, abstracting from the effects of

ATS.1/ This represents an upward adjustment in the level of interest

rates forecast by the staff. The interest rate forecast might have

been expected to decline because alternative B in effect forgives

the "overshoot" in M-1 growth during the third quarter and, hence,

does not imply as low a rate of monetary growth over the next few

quarters as it did earlier. However, our previous interest rate fore-

cast assumed a fairly significant downward shift in M-1 demand relative

to income. There has been no evidence of such a shift in recent quarters,

and without the restraint of even higher interest rates than earlier

projected it appears that growth in M-1 (or M-1+) would run above the

1/ Allowing for the ATS effect on M-1, and given the 1½ to 4½ per
cent range of probable ATS effect, M-1 growth in a 2 to 5 per cent
range after ATS would be economically equivalent to 6½ per cent
ex-ATS.



-8-

alternative B range. Even so it should be noted that our new interest

rate estimates still assume some renewed downward drift in M-1 demand,

apart from the effects of automatic transfers.1 /

(12) The longer-run ranges for M-2 and M-3 have been

raised relative to M-1. Thus, under alternative B, M-2 growth for

the year ahead is expected to be in a 7 to 9½ per cent range and

M-3 growth in an 8 to 11 per cent range, ½ and 1 percentage point

higher than current longer-run ranges. The M-2 range was raised

to take account of the recent somewhat more rapid growth in time

deposits other than large CD's and to allow for a modest shift from

deposits at thrift institutions to ATS accounts at banks.2/ The

range for M-3 was raised more substantially in recognition of the

apparent ability, and also willingness, of savings institutions,

especially S&L's, to raise substantial amounts of new money through

the 6-month money market certificate. Of course, net inflows of

deposits to thrifts should slow from its recent pace in the months

ahead, as rising interest rates further moderate inflows of deposits

subject to fixed rate-ceilings, the effects of the stock adjustment

from other financial assets wane, and depository institutions perhaps

without automatic transfers in the case of M-1.

growth by about ¼ percentage point over the QIII '78
QIII '79 period.



become less aggressive in offering the new certificates as the spread

continues to narrow between their deposit costs and mortgage rates.

(13) The longer-run alternative C ranges encompass growth

rates for M-2 and M-3 nearer to those currently in place. In addition,

alternative C calls for a slower longer-run growth in M-1--in a

3 to 5 per cent range, abstracting from ATS. Growth around the

upper end of that range would tend to compensate for the "overshoot"

in M-1 expansion over the first three quarters of this year and would

lead to about a 6 per cent annual rate of growth from the end of

1977 through the third quarter of 1979, as may be seen in the bottom

line of appendix III-1.

(14) Two alternative short-run specifications for the

monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate believed to be generally

consistent with the longer-run proposals for the aggregates are presented

below for Committee consideration. Alternative I contemplates a Federal

funds rate range centered on the current 8¾ per cent level, while

Alternative II calls for a rise in the funds rate to 9¼ per cent.

No easing alternative for the short-run is presented because all

proposed longer-run ranges involve either stable or rising interest rates

over the next several months. (More detailed and longer-run data

are shown in tables on pages 10 and 11; the numbers in parentheses

in those tables show estimates abstracting from the effect of ATS).

(15) For the Committee's convenience, and in case of an

adverse court finding, the short-run specifications include M-1

both with and without the impact of automatic transfers. The

supplementary aggregate M-1+ is also shown should the Committee wish

to provide additional quantitative guidance for the Desk in the

transitional period. In developing our estimate for M-1 including

the effect of ATS, we have assumed that $900 million are shifted from

demand to ATS accounts on average in November, with a range of error of

plus or minus $600 million. This works out to an effect on M-1

over the two month Oct-Nov. period of ½ to 2½ percentage points at

an annual rate. Over this period M-1 can be expected to grow

in a 1 to 7 per cent annual rate range (or 3½ to 7½ per cent)

abstracting from ATS). A sizable build-up in Treasury cash balances

may be a factor holding down M-1 growth in October, but in November



-13-

M-1 expansion is expected to resume at close to the average pace

thus far this year (apart from the effect of ATS).1/

(16) Expansion in M-2 under Alternative I is likely to be

in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range over the October-November

period. The interest-bearing component of M-2 will, of course,

be buoyed by shifts from demand to automatic transfer savings

accounts, and growth of the remaining savings and time deposits

included in this aggregate is expected to slow only somewhat from

its recent strong pace. Although inflows to nontransferable savings

accounts are expected to slow sharply from the recent surprisingly

rapid pace, sales of 6-month certificates and large denomination time

deposits are likely to continue to support time deposit growth at a

rate close to recent levels.

(17) The continued surprising strength of thrift deposits

is also likely to be sustained in October as these institutions,

through the issuance of 6-month certificates, capture a larger than

normal portion of the sizable volume of longer-term certificates

maturing this month at banks and thrifts. Growth in thrift deposit

inflows seems likely to begin slowing by November, though remaining

considerably stronger than in the first half of the year.

(18) If the Federal funds rate remains around its current

level of 8¾ per cent over the intermeeting period and published

1/ The relationship between current levels of M-1, as well as other
monetary aggregates, and the FOMC's longer-run ranges are shown
in the set of charts attached after p. 18.



-14-

growth of the monetary aggregates moderates as the staff projects,

other short-term interest rates are also likely to change little.

Business demands for short-term credit probably will continue at

the more moderate third quarter level, and the Treasury is not

expected to be tapping the bill market for new money until late

in the year.

(19) Under alternative I, yields on longer-term securities

also are likely to show little further change in the near-term,

abstracting from possible expectational effects of any new Administration

wage-price program. Oncoming supplies of new corporate and municipal

securities are expected to remain relatively moderate, and given recent

foreign central bank acquisitions of nonmarketable Treasury securities,

the Treasury's need to raise new cash in the market over the fourth

quarter has been reduced somewhat further. In its mid-November

refunding--to be announced October 25--the Treasury is expected to roll

over $4.6 billion of maturing debt and to raise around $1½ to 2

billion of new money. Following thisoperation, the Treasury probably

will need to raise only about $7 billion of new money in the coupon

market over the remainder of the fourth quarter.

(20) Alternative II calls for an increase in the Federal

funds rate to around the mid-point of a 9 to 9½ per cent range during

the intermeeting period. This alternative appears particularly

appropriate if the Committee opts for the slower longer-run growth

in the aggregates encompassed by alternative C. It would also be

consistent with the longer-run policy stance indexed by alternative B,

as well as with near-term efforts to support the dollar in exchange

markets. The tightening of the funds market over the weeks ahead



-15-

envisaged by alternative II would--by introducing restraint earlier--

increase the likelihood that the funds rate would not have to rise

into the upper part of the 9 to 10¼ per cent range projected for next

year under alternative B.

(21) Under alternative II, M-1 growth, including the effect

of automatic transfers, would likely be in a ½ to 6½ per cent annual

rate range over the October-November period, M-2 in a 5½ to 9½ per

cent range, and M-1+ in a 2½ to 6½ per cent range. The additional

interest rate pressure would slow the growth of non-transferable

savings deposits and time deposits subject to fixed rate-ceilings, but

the effects of this slowing on the total interest-bearing components

of M-2 and M-3 may be dampened by issuance of 6-month certificates

and, at banks, large denomination time deposits.

(22) The percentage point increase in the funds rate

contemplated under alternative II would place further upward

pressure on other short- and long-term interest rates. The bond

markets appear to be in a strong technical position, with dealer

inventories light and the forward calendar of new offerings moderate,

but such a rise in the funds rate, coupled with the recent discount

rate action, is likely to carry long rates back above the early

July peaks. Mortgage market conditions are likely to tighten further

as the effective cost of the 6-month money market certificate moves

up to close to 9½ per cent, and thrifts become somewhat more cautious

in their lending attitudes.

Directive language

(23) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs

for the directive. Alternative language consistent with the short-

run specifications of the alternatives discussed in the preceding

section is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal funds

rate early in the period. At a later point, alternative language is

also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates

or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted at the

September meeting are shown in strike-through form.

(24) To take account of uncertainties associated with

the introduction of ATS, the Committee may also wish to consider certain

modifications of its instructions to the Manager. These might include

introduction of M-1+ as a third operating range and insertion of

language to recognize the uncertainties introduced by ATS. In

addition, at least for now, the Committee may wish to eliminate the

phrase in the directive that gives equal weight to M-1 and M-2 so

as to enable the Manager to take the behavior of M-1+ into account in

appraising performance of the aggregates in the transition period.

These modifications are indicated in the language below in capital

letters and strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic



-17-

and international financial markets more generally AND TO

UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE AUTOMATIC

TRANSFER SERVICE. Early in the period until the next regular

meeting, System open market operations shall be directed at

attaining a weekly-average Federal funds rate

(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL
(B) slightly (OR SOMEWHAT) above the current level.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly-average Federal funds rate with the range of [DEL: 8¼ to 8¾]

____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific objective

for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly

by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual

rates of growth in the [DEL: September-October] OCTOBER-NOVEMBER

period of M-1, M-1+, and M-2 and the following ranges of

tolerance: [DEL: 5 to 9] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1, ____ TO ____

PER CENT FOR M-+, and [DEL: 6½ to 10½] ____ TO ____ per cent for

M-2. If, [DEL: giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2,]

their rates of growth appear to be

Monetary aggregates emphasis

significantly above or below the midpoints

Money market emphasis

CLOSE TO OR BEYOND THE UPPER OR LOWER LIMITS

of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate shall

be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be

above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated



-18-

ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has

already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the

Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from

the Committee.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities
financed by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term.
Underwriting syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess
reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except:
for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions of
6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. Data in column 5 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns 8 through
11, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respec-

tively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80
per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives

FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net
yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the
coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
