MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The Committee’s decision at the August meeting to tighten policy a quarter 

point, to maintain an assessment that the risks to both price stability and sustainable 

growth were balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” language evoked little 

market reaction.1  Over the subsequent few weeks, expectations for the path of the 

nominal federal funds rate edged lower in response to rising energy prices and 

economic data releases suggesting somewhat softer spending and more subdued 

inflation.  As the extent of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation became apparent, energy 

prices spiked higher and investors marked down their outlook for policy further.  The 

revision to the outlook was reinforced by the mention in the minutes of the August 

FOMC meeting of risks to consumer spending posed by elevated energy prices and by 

economic data releases indicating that economic growth may have been slowing even 

before the hurricane.  In recent days, however, interest rate futures have retraced 

some of those declines, influenced by a drop in energy prices as well as comments by 

several FOMC participants that noted underlying strength in spending and some 

concerns about inflation.  On net over the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate 

expected for the middle of next year shifted down 30 basis points, to about 4 percent, 

while measures of uncertainty about this path for policy derived from options prices 

rose notably (Chart 1).  Futures quotes suggest about a one-in-five chance that the 

FOMC will leave policy unchanged on Tuesday, the first time in more than two years 

that the policy outcome has appeared this uncertain this close to the date of the 

                                           
1 Over the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds rate was close to the target.  The 
Desk purchased $6.4 billion of Treasury coupon securities and $2.5 billion of Treasury bills 
in the market.  There was also a redemption of $757 million of Treasury coupon securities.  
The volume of outstanding long-term RPs decreased $1 billion, to $18 billion.

meeting.  Respondents to the Desk’s latest dealer survey attach slightly higher odds to 

a pause at this meeting, and only a few expect any change to the characterization of 

policy as accommodative or to the “measured pace” language.   

(2) Yields on nominal Treasury notes shed about 20 to 30 basis points over the 

intermeeting period.2  The decline in longer-term yields was accounted for by a 

reduction in forward rates across the term structure in the pre-Katrina period—

consistent with a revision to the longer-term outlook—and a further drop post-

Katrina in near-term forward rates—suggestive of a larger downward revision to the 

economic outlook in the nearer term.  On net, the price of crude oil was about 

unchanged over the intermeeting period, but wholesale gasoline prices edged up, and 

natural gas prices jumped (Chart 2). 3  TIPS-implied inflation compensation for the 

next five years increased about 15 basis points over the intermeeting period, while 

inflation compensation in the five-to-ten-year range changed little.  Survey measures 

of inflation expectations held steady, although those surveys were mostly conducted 

before the hurricane.   

(3) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds moved down about in line 

with those on Treasuries, leaving their risk spreads about flat.  Spreads on speculative-

grade debt widened somewhat, but generally remained narrow.  Major equity indexes 

were little changed over the intermeeting period, and the implied volatility of stock 

prices remained low, as equity market participants apparently assessed the likely 

aggregate economic impact of Hurricane Katrina as being fairly moderate and 

                                           
2 Concerns about trading in the August 2012 note related to the current ten-year Treasury 
note futures contract prompted the Treasury to require a position report from large holders.  
More details on the situation are provided in the box on the next page. 
3 However, spot oil prices had risen $3 per barrel between the publication of the August 
Greenbook and the August FOMC meeting.  As a result, oil prices are considerably higher in 
the current staff forecast than they were in the August forecast.

 Developments in the Ten-Year Treasury Futures Market 

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) lists ten-year Treasury futures contracts for delivery in 
March, June, September and December of each year.  Trading in these contracts is very active, 
and they have come to serve an important role in hedging interest-rate risk.  Each contract 
requires the party on the short side to deliver any Treasury security with a remaining maturity 
between six-and-a-half and ten years to the party on the long side.  The invoice price that the 
party on the long side pays for the security is the accrued interest plus the futures price multiplied 
by a conversion factor that adjusts for the different coupons and maturities of the securities in 
the deliverable basket.  By design, the conversion factor that CBOT uses works well when 
market yields are around 6 percent.  However, with yields now well below that level, some 
securities are much cheaper to deliver than others. 

Historically, the vast majority of investors in this market have closed out their positions or 
rolled into the next contract rather than actually taking delivery.  However, as shown in the 
bottom left panel, in the past few contract cycles open interest has remained relatively elevated 
in the final days of trading and a larger-than-usual number of contracts have gone through the 
delivery process, resulting in strained trading conditions for the cheapest-to-deliver securities.  
This pattern appears to be occurring again for the September 2005 contract, for which open 
interest currently stands at a record high for this stage in the contract cycle.  The cheapest-to-
deliver issue, which is the August 2012 note, has been trading at a substantial premium to 
comparable-maturity securities in the cash market, its repo rate has been close to zero, and the 
level of failures to deliver for this issue has been elevated. Concerns about trading in this note 
have led the Treasury to require a position report of large holders. As shown in the bottom 
right panel, the System Open Market Account has in recent days lent out a large fraction of its 
holdings of the August 2012 note in its securities lending program (new awards on any one day 
are capped at 65 percent of holdings) . Some investors complain that the parties on the long 
side of the futures contract are attempting to generate a short squeeze.  CBOT announced in 
June that it will limit investors' position sizes near expiration to $5 billion starting with the 
December 2005 contract.

temporary, and offset by lower interest rates and higher anticipated federal spending.4  

The stocks of oil companies and utilities registered substantial gains, while a broad 

index of property and casualty insurers was down only about 2 percent, although the 

shares of Allstate insurance company, which has a significant exposure in the Gulf 

Coast area, declined 7 percent.  The announcement that two more large U.S. air 

carriers entered into bankruptcy yesterday was widely expected and caused barely a 

ripple in financial markets.   

(4) The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major 

foreign currencies fell about ¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period 

(Chart 3).5  The dollar was pressured lower during the period by data indicating 

somewhat  weaker U.S. economic performance and, for a while, by concerns about 

the consequences of Hurricane Katrina.  The dollar moved up about 1 percent against 

the euro, as economic performance in the euro area continued to be sluggish, but it 

slipped almost 1½ percent versus the yen and 2¼ percent vis-à-vis the Canadian 

dollar.  The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate 25 basis points—the first such move 

in almost a year.  Yields on benchmark long-term government securities in most 

foreign industrial countries dropped 15 to 25 basis points over the intermeeting 

period, while yields in Japan edged down only a small amount.  Stock prices in most 

countries were about unchanged or up slightly on balance, but share prices rose 

10 percent in Japan, reacting in part to strong second-quarter earnings reports from 

Japanese banks and also to the support for the governing coalition shown in national 

elections earlier this week.  

                                           
4 Timing conventions matter here as well.  Stock prices were off modestly from the August 
Greenbook publication date to the September Greenbook publication date but up a touch 
from the meeting date.  The former comparison is relevant for the discussion of revisions to 
the forecast in the “Economic Outlook” section of the Bluebook, while the latter is the basis 
for this section’s discussion of recent developments.

(5) Over the intermeeting period, the dollar recorded a modest gain against an 

index of currencies of our other important trading partners that included an increase 

of 1½ percent versus the Mexican peso; the dollar was about unchanged versus the 

Brazilian real.  Responding to weaker activity and better inflation news, the Bank of 

Mexico eased its overnight lending rate 25 basis points; the central bank of Brazil also 

cut its target rate 25 basis points.  The dollar appreciated against several Asian 

currencies on worries about the effects of higher oil prices on economies in that 

region.  The dollar depreciated about ¼ percent on balance over the intermeeting 

period against the Chinese renminbi, though that currency continued to trade against 

the dollar in a very tight range from day to day. 

(6) Domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be on track for a fairly solid advance 

in the third quarter (Chart 4).  With mortgage rates still low and house-price 

appreciation apparently remaining robust, household debt seems likely to register 

another substantial gain this quarter.  Nonfinancial business debt has been expanding 

at a moderate pace.  Spreads on bank business loans remain fairly narrow, although 

those on loans to lower-quality customers appear to have widened a bit from their 

narrow levels in the spring.  Business credit quality remains strong:  Delinquency and 

charge-off rates on business loans at banks edged down to near record lows in the 

second quarter, and defaults on corporate bonds were negligible in recent months 

although they ticked up in early September.   

(7) M2 accelerated to a 5 percent annual rate in August, owing in part to a 

resumption of growth in liquid deposits.  In recent weeks, M2 has continued to 

expand, on average, at a faster pace than would have been predicted based on its 

historical relationship with opportunity costs and nominal income, perhaps because 

returns on longer-term assets have not been especially attractive.  Cash shipments to 

depository institutions located in the region affected by Hurricane Katrina have

6 The box at the end of this section discusses the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the 
reserves and monetary aggregates. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 38



  The Effects of Hurricane Katrina on Reserves and Monetary Aggregates 
 
As yet, there have been few discernible imprints of Hurricane Katrina on aggregate 
monetary and banking statistics.  Currency shipments in the six Federal Reserve offices 
serving the affected area are up about $3 billion relative to those in 2002 and 2003, years that 
were not greatly affected by hurricanes (chart).  But this represents only about 1 percent of 
estimated domestic currency holdings.     
 
While many of the affected depository institutions – especially banks and thrifts insured by 
the FDIC – have discount window borrowing documents in place, and some of them have 
collateral as well (table), there have been no requests for discount window advances by 
depositories in the region since Katrina’s landfall and only a few instances of small overnight 
overdrafts.  Liquidity needs apparently have not picked up given the severe dislocation of 
activity.  Such needs may increase as the clean-up continues, and the discount window and 
other sources of liquidity—including bankers’ banks, corporate central credit unions, and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank System—will be available to meet them. 
 
According to the latest data, deposits in the area most affected by the storm account for only 
about 1¼ percent of the national total.  Some of those deposits are held at institutions that 
are diversified regionally or nationally, but two-thirds of deposits in the affected area are 
held at institutions that have more than half of their deposits booked at offices in the region.  
A significant majority of the assets of these institutions are loans to households and 
businesses (presumably heavily weighted toward the local area) and municipal obligations, 
suggesting that the value of collateral these institutions would pledge should they decide to 
tap the discount window may be quite uncertain. 
 
The weekly deposit data (which are partly estimated for the area) do not yet suggest 
significant deposit inflows or outflows.  Presumably, as the clean-up and rebuilding of the 
region accelerates, fueled importantly by federal transfers and insurance payments, more 
noticeable deposit flows will emerge.

Economic Outlook 

(8) The staff has appreciably revised its economic projection, mainly to 

incorporate the effects of Hurricane Katrina.  The disruption to economic activity is 

expected to hold down output and employment for several months before giving way 

to recovery and reconstruction, aided by a large injection of federal spending.  By the 

end of 2007, economic activity is seen as essentially back on the path in the August 

forecast, with output close to its potential.  As in August, the staff has assumed that 

the stance of monetary policy is tightened gradually over the next several quarters; the 

federal funds rate reaches 4¼ percent by the middle of next year, a bit higher than 

currently embedded in financial market prices.  Bond yields are expected to drift up 

over the forecast period, as market participants come to appreciate that monetary 

policy will firm slightly more than currently anticipated.  Equity prices rise at a pace 

sufficient to produce risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income 

securities, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to edge down.  As 

suggested by futures markets, the price of crude oil is forecast to follow a path 

somewhat above that in the last projection, with spot prices rising slightly over the 

next few months before declining gradually thereafter.  Retail energy prices in the near 

term are expected to rise more substantially than predicted in August, owing partly to 

disruptions to energy production and distribution that resulted from the hurricane, 

but then to fall more steeply as the industry’s infrastructure is rebuilt.  The near-term 

projection for overall inflation has been revised up sharply, mainly reflecting the direct 

effects of higher consumer energy prices.  As energy prices recede, however, overall 

PCE inflation is forecast to drop a little below 2 percent in 2006 and 2007.  The 

projection for core inflation this year has been shaved a bit, but with the pass-through 

of increased energy prices it has been boosted to 2¼ percent for 2006, up about 

¼ percentage point from the August round.  Core inflation edges down to 2 percent 

the following year. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 12 of 38



Policy Alternatives 

(9) This Bluebook presents two formal policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Both draft 

announcements refer to the adverse near-term effects on spending, production, and 

employment of Hurricane Katrina.  (The box entitled “Monetary Policy 

Announcements and External Events” summarizes the Committee’s past practice 

with respect to mentioning significant exogenous events in its statements.)  The 

announcements also refer to inflation pressures but indicate that core inflation has 

been relatively low.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would leave its target for the 

federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this meeting; the statement would 

emphasize hurricane-related uncertainties and suggest that this was just a pause in the 

tightening process.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would boost the target 

25 basis points to 3¾ percent; the statement would note that the longer-term 

macroeconomic effects of the hurricane are likely to be limited.  Because uncertainty 

surrounding the economic outlook has risen considerably, this Bluebook also 

considers ways of shading the language under Alternatives A and B to project more 

distinct paths for policy.  Paragraph 13 considers changes to the statement language 

(relative to Alternative B) that could express more concern about inflation.  In 

contrast, paragraph 16 suggests wording changes to Alternative A that would be 

consistent with an expectation of a more prolonged pause in firming.  Lastly, the box 

at the end of this section entitled “Opening Up the Statement” examines fundamental 

changes to the risk assessment that could be made to either Alternative A or B. 

(10) If the Committee remains particularly concerned about heightened inflation 

pressures and sees little chance that Hurricane Katrina will have lasting and sizable 

adverse effects on aggregate spending and production, it may wish to tighten policy  

25 basis points at this meeting, as under Alternative B.  The Committee may view the 

downward revision to monetary policy expectations and the associated easing of

high energy prices, appears to have 
strengthened since late winter, and 
labor market conditions continue 
to improve gradually. 

Output appeared poised to

devastation in the Gulf region, the 
associated dislocation of economic 
activity, and the boost to energy 
prices imply that spending,

be set back in the near term.

Rationale 

4.  Core inflation has been 
relatively low in recent months and 
longer-term inflation expectations 
remain well contained, but 
pressures on inflation have stayed 
elevated. 

Higher energy and other costs have 
the potential to add to inflation 
pressures.  However, core inflation 
has been relatively low in recent 
months and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well 
contained.

5.  The Committee perceives that, 
with appropriate monetary policy 
action, the upside and downside

sustainable growth and price 
stability should be kept roughly 
equal.

financial conditions as an overreaction to recent developments, inclining it to try to 

reverse at least a portion of this accommodation.  Indeed, the real federal funds rate 

remains below the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value (Chart 5), 

suggesting that further policy tightening will be necessary even after a 25 basis point 

move at the upcoming meeting.7  Considerable government spending will be 

forthcoming to help rebuild the Gulf region, adding to pressures on resources.  

Moreover, the further upward spike in consumer energy prices raises the possibility 

that the FOMC may need to bring the real funds rate above its equilibrium value for a 

time in order to reverse inflationary momentum.  A range of monetary policy rules, 
                                           
7 Starting with this Bluebook, the TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate 
incorporates time-varying estimates of a term premium that compensates investors for 
uncertainty about real rates and of a liquidity premium that compensates investors for the 
relatively poor liquidity of TIPS.  Both estimates are obtained from a three-factor arbitrage-
free term-structure model. 

Monetary Policy Announcements and External Events 
 
There is precedent for the Committee to allude to significant external events in 
its monetary policy announcement.  For example, in December 1999, the Federal 
Reserve announced that “in light of market uncertainties associated with the 
century date change, the Committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in 
order to indicate that the focus of policy in the intermeeting period must be 
ensuring a smooth transition into the Year 2000.”  On September 17, 2001, the 
Committee cited the “tragic events” of the previous week.  And in January, 
March, and May 2003, the monetary policy statements referred variously to “oil 
price premiums,” “geopolitical uncertainties,” and the “hostilities” in Iraq.  
Indeed, in its announcement that March, the Committee temporarily suspended 
its practice of specifying the balance of risks to its dual objectives in light of the 
elevated uncertainty surrounding the situation in Iraq. 
 
The announcements proposed for Alternatives A and B are consistent with this 
pattern, citing “the tragic toll” of Hurricane Katrina.  They also acknowledge that 
data on spending, production, and employment will deteriorate as the hurricane’s 
effects show through in coming months.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter. 
   

Measure Description 

Single-Equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 38



especially those based on an inflation target of 1½ percent, also point to a further 

near-term increase in the federal funds rate and suggest more tightening in coming 

quarters (Chart 6).  The Committee’s uncertainty about prospects for the economy 

and inflation may well have increased in the aftermath of the hurricane, but probably 

a few months will elapse before a reasonably clear picture of its economic effects 

emerges.  Thus, unless the Committee sees the hurricane as likely to undermine 

spending significantly for several quarters or more—the period in which a change in 

monetary policy would have most of its effect on spending—or has serious concerns 

that a rate hike might interact in a particularly unfavorable way with household and 

business confidence, members might believe it prudent to continue to firm policy at 

this meeting. 

(11) As shown in Table 1, the proposed announcement associated with 

Alternative B would indicate that “Output appeared poised to continue growing at a 

good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina.”  It would go on to state that, 

while the hurricane will have adverse short-run economic consequences, including 

heightened uncertainty and market volatility, the longer-run prospects for the 

economy are not diminished.  The statement would note that “Higher energy and 

other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures,” but would also indicate 

that “. . . core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term 

inflation expectations remain well contained.”  It would assert that “remaining 

monetary policy accommodation” and robust underlying growth in productivity 

continued to support economic activity.  The rest of the statement would repeat the 

measured pace language and the assessment that, with appropriate monetary policy 

action, the risks to growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. 

(12) Investors currently see a modest probability that the FOMC will leave the 

stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting.  Accordingly, a quarter-point 

increase in the funds rate would tend to boost very short-term market interest rates a

bit, and the retention of the “measured pace” language would suggest that further 

policy tightening was likely, probably bringing the funds rate beyond the 4 percent 

apex currently anticipated in markets.  Consequently, other market interest rates 

would likely increase somewhat in response to the announcement.  The foreign 

exchange value of the dollar could strengthen a touch, and equity prices could decline 

a bit, although the suggestion that the FOMC was confident that the economic 

expansion would not be severely affected by the hurricane could serve to limit the 

decline in stock prices. 

(13) At the August meeting, several participants noted that core PCE inflation 

was running at the upper end of the range they considered to be consistent with price 

stability.  Since then, the staff has marked up its forecast of core inflation for next year 

about ¼ percentage point, to 2¼ percent.  Moreover, the edging lower of inflation 

thereafter in the projection owes importantly to the assumed gradual decline in energy 

prices.  If the Committee saw this inflation outcome as unacceptable or believed that 

such an expectation was likely to prove optimistic, then it might view the words of 

Alternative B as too timid about the prospects for additional policy tightening.  Such a 

concern might well be intensified if significant odds were put on the possibility that 

inflation expectations could become unanchored in response to surging energy prices, 

perhaps in the manner discussed in the alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  The 

likelihood of more tightening than currently built into financial market prices could be 

conveyed to the public by shortening the wording for Alternative B that appears in 

Table 1.  In particular, the Committee could give less weight to the disruptions from 

Hurricane Katrina by striking the second and third sentences and dropping the word 

“remaining” in row 3.8 

(14) The Committee, in contrast, could arrive at a decision to keep the federal 

funds rate unchanged for several reasons.  One possibility is that, while generally 

                                           
8 Minor corresponding changes to the fourth sentence of row 3 would also be required. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 38



accepting the economic outlook discussed under Alternative B, members may harbor 

the reservation that there is a small probability that the disruption to economic activity 

in the Gulf region and sapping of consumer and business confidence nationwide 

could have serious consequences for the broader economy.  While the mean (or 

modal) outlook might be taken as a reason to tighten, consideration of that adverse 

tail may counsel delaying further firming for a time.  Under Alternative A, the 

Committee would keep the target federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this 

meeting and use the statement to explain that it was merely deferring firming in light 

of the elevated uncertainties, and likely not ending the tightening cycle.  As in 

Alternative B, the Committee could note the adverse near-term effects of the 

hurricane on spending, production, and employment, but not include the sentence 

suggesting that the effects will be temporary.  The text on inflation in Alternative B 

could also be used in Alternative A.   

(15) Short-term market interest rates would likely decline noticeably following 

announcement of this alternative.  However, with the statement suggesting that 

further tightening was still in the cards, the drop in intermediate- and longer-term 

rates probably would be considerably smaller.  Equity prices could move slightly 

higher, while the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets could decline a bit. 

(16) Another possible reason for holding the funds rate unchanged is that a 

longer pause in policy firming could be appropriate.  Committee members may be 

concerned that the widespread and severe damage to private property and 

infrastructure in the Gulf region, the extended displacement of a large population, the 

sharp increase in consumer energy prices, and a potential significant drop in consumer 

confidence could well exert a more substantial drag on aggregate economic activity 

than in the staff forecast.  Such a possibility is illustrated in the Greenbook’s 

“sentiment slump” scenario and the scenario based on a pessimistic view of the 

effects of Katrina.  Moreover, while the stance of policy may still be accommodative, 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 38



the extent of that accommodation has been reduced significantly by the Committee’s 

actions through August.  Thus, the Committee may feel comfortable awaiting further 

Opening Up the Statement 
 

The “measured pace” language, which has been included in the 
Committee’s statements for the past eleven meetings, has served to signal to 
market participants that the federal funds rate will be marched up steadily as long 
as policy accommodation remains in place.  The Committee may believe that this 
language has now outlived its usefulness for several reasons, independent of this 
meeting’s outcome on the stance of policy.  First, the 2½-percentage-point 
increase in the nominal federal funds rate since mid-2004 has placed the real 
federal funds rate near some model-based estimates of its equilibrium (as shown 
in Chart 5).  By that arithmetic, some members might be of the view that policy 
accommodation has been substantially removed and that the Committee should 
halt the process of firming sometime soon.  Second, the devastation in the Gulf 
region probably implies that more uncertainty attends the outlook, and this 
uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved soon, perhaps increasing the attractiveness 
of being more gradual in removing policy accommodation.  Third, the 
possibilities that elevated energy prices, on the one hand, could sap consumer 
confidence or, on the other, unanchor inflation expectations may require more 
nimble adjustments to the stance of policy than consistent with the “measured 
pace” language. 

 
In prior discussions of statement language, some have expressed a 

preference for providing signals about the future direction of policy only in 
unusual situations, if at all.  In that view, guidance about interest rates, which 
seemed useful when significant disinflation was a risk and at the outset of policy 
tightening, is no longer useful when the Committee is unsure about its actions at 
the next few meetings.  The simple expedient, then, would be to drop rows 5 and 
6 and any mention of the extent of policy accommodation in Table 1. 

 
Others have argued, however, that providing information about the future 

direction of the federal funds rate helps the public make better-informed 
decisions, enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Moreover, simply 
stating that the Committee was not certain whether the next move in rates would 
be up or down would, on this view, be useful information to market participants.

(continued on next page)

information on the effects of Hurricane Katrina, as well as of the cumulative 

tightening of policy to date, before resuming policy firming—even if that wait could 

be extended.  Such a view could be conveyed to the public by striking sentence 2 from 

the draft statement for Alternative A.  The statement could also drop the word 

“action” that now appears in row 5 in order to suggest that appropriate monetary 

Opening Up the Statement (cont.) 
 

One way of regaining flexibility about the range of future action while still 
providing such information would be to eliminate the “measured pace” language 
from the statement and move from the current practice of basing the risk 
assessment on appropriate policy to assuming explicitly that the current stance of 
policy will be kept unchanged for several quarters.  Under such an assumption, 
the assessments of the probabilities of lower or higher economic growth than is 
sustainable and of lower or higher inflation, along with an overall risk assessment 
if needed, can provide guidance about the future direction of policy.  Rows 5 and 
6 of Table 1 in both columns A and B could be replaced with the following 
formula: 

 
The Committee’s economic outlook is such that, if the federal 
funds rate were maintained at its current level for the next several 
quarters, output growth is [less/as/more] likely to be above 
[as/than] below its sustainable pace.  Inflation over the same period 
is [less/as/more] likely to increase [as to/than] decrease.  As a 
result, the Committee views the near-term risks to its dual 
objectives as [tilted to the downside/balanced/tilted to the upside].  
In any event, the Committee is prepared to take the steps necessary 
to maintain price stability and sustainable economic growth. 

If the Committee desires to convey the sense that the current stance of policy is 
unsustainably easy, it could set both toggle switches to their “more” setting.  
That is, it would tell the public that, if maintained for the next few quarters, a 
nominal funds rate of 3½ percent (under A) or 3¾ percent (under B) would 
likely foster a pickup in resource utilization and inflation.  As both 
measurements would point in the same direction, the overall risk balance 
sentence could be omitted in this case with no harm to clarity. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 38



policy going forward would not necessarily involve near-term tightening, and refer to 

“remaining” policy accommodation in the first sentence in row 6. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(17) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to average about 

3 percent over the third and fourth quarters of 2005, leaving growth for the year as a 

whole just under 3 percent (Table 2).  Velocity is forecast to increase 3¼ percent this 

year.  Over 2006 and 2007, the expansion of M2 is forecast to pick up to 4¼ percent 

and 5 percent, respectively, with the velocity of M2 flattening out as the effects on 

opportunity costs of past policy firmings fade.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is 

forecast to decelerate over the forecast period.  The expansion of household sector 

debt is projected to slow in the fourth quarter of 2005 to 8 percent and to continue to 

decline over subsequent quarters, reaching about a 6 percent rate by the end of 2007, 

as a moderation in home price appreciation prompts a significant deceleration of 

home mortgage debt.  The expansion of business sector debt is also projected to slow, 

but more gradually.  Federal debt growth, by contrast, remains brisk over the forecast 

period, with growth rates of 7¾ percent, 8½ percent, and 8 percent, respectively, for 

the years 2005 though 2007.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(18) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate AT/to 

an average of around ____________ 3½ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, 

the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable 

growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 

inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy 

accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  

Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 

prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. 

B. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, 

the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable 

growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 

inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy 

accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
