MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The monetary aggregates expanded rapidly over the last

two months. Growth in M1 was at a 10.4 percent annual rate in December and

a 9 percent rate in January, above the growth path for November to March of

7 percent established by the Committee at its last meeting. 1 M2 and M3

over the past two months increased considerably more rapidly than their

short-run objectives of 9 percent, rising on average by 14 and 13-1/2

percent at an annual rate, respectively. From the fourth quarter of 1983

to the fourth quarter of 1984 M1 is now estimated to have grown 5.2 percent,

somewhat below the midpoint of the 4 to 8 percent growth range for the year

while M2 expanded 7.7 percent, just above the midpoint of its 6 to 9 percent

range; M3 grew by 10.5 percent, well above its 6 to 9 percent range.

(2) All of the major components of M1 contributed to its recent

strength, which has reflected the decline in interest rates since late

summer and the lift in economic activity in the fourth quarter. Growth of

M2 and M3 continued to be boosted by the tendency for declines in rates on

both MMDAs and MMMFs to lag the decrease in market rates. The reduction in

the minimum balance for super NOW accounts and MMDAs apparently had little

impact on either M1 or M2. Flows into these accounts picked up early in

the year, but contacts with banks and examination of data suggest that any

shifts to take advantage of the lower minimums came, in the case of super

1. These growth rates and all subsequent data on the monetary aggregates
in this Bluebook incorporate annual benchmark and seasonal factor re-
visions. The revised series will be published on Thursday, February 14,
along with seasonal factors for 1985. The revisions and their effects
on growth in M1, M2, and M3 over recent years are described in the
appendix. Data are confidential until that time.

NOWs, preponderantly out of ordinary NOW accounts and, in the case of

MMDAs, out of other components of M2.

(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to

have expanded at about a 14 percent annual rate in December, bringing

growth for the year to 13.4 percent, considerably above the annual moni-

toring range of 8 to 11 percent for 1984. Unusual merger activity and

share repurchases contributed about one percentage point to credit growth

last year. In addition, growth was raised a little--perhaps 1/4 of a

percentage point--by a rush of tax-exempt securities toward year-end in

advance of a lightening of certain restrictions.

(4) Total reserves increased at an average annual rate of 25

percent over December and January, as transactions accounts expanded

rapidly. With borrowing at the discount window declining over the two

months, nonborrowed reserves increased somewhat more rapidly, at an average

annual rate of 33 percent. The nonborrowed reserves path has been con-

structed over the entire intermeeting period on the assumption of sea-

sonal plus adjustment borrowing of $300 million. In the first part of

the period the Desk conducted operations in such a way as to tilt the

odds toward a reserve provision consistent with borrowing of $300 million

or somewhat less. More recently, with the aggregates running above the

FOMC's short-run paths, open market operations have been conducted with-

out such a tilt. Borrowing averaged $260 million in the first complete

reserve period in January, following a bulge in both excess reserves and

borrowing over the year-end statement date. In the following reserve

period ending January 30 and during the first half of the current reserve

period, borrowing has averaged $389 million, with excess reserves running

somewhat stronger than anticipated.



(5) Federal funds have traded mostly in an 8 to 8-1/2 percent

range over the intermeeting period, averaging just over 8-1/4 percent.

During the last week of January and into the early days of February, trad-

ing was mostly near the upper end of this range, and for a few days above

it. This development, taken together with the strength in money growth and

the relatively good performance of the economy, worked to eliminate ex-

pectations in the market that the Federal Reserve would ease further and

tended to raise concerns that the System might be seeking tighter reserve

conditions. Since the previous Committee meeting, short-term rates have

risen 20 to 40 basis points. Long-term rates fell sharply in late January

when prospects for oil prices seemed to portend a more favorable inflation

outlook; these rate declines have been largely reversed subsequently in

response to rising short-term rates and a mid-quarter Treasury financing

package that was a little larger than anticipated. On balance taxable

bond yields are up about 5 to down about 10 basis points over the period.

(6) The dollar has appreciated by about 5-1/4 percent on a

weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting to reach a new

record high. Some of the dollar's recent strength may be attributable to

indications that U.S. economic activity is more robust than had been anti-

cipated two months ago. Lower than expected U.S. trade deficits for

November-December may also have helped to boost the dollar.

The United States sold $321 million, of which $272 million was against

marks and the remainder against yen.



Alternative monetary growth ranges for 1985

(7) Three alternative long-run growth ranges for the year 1985

(QIV to QIV basis) are shown below for Committee consideration, along with

the tentative ranges for that year adopted in mid-1984.1 Alternative II

encompasses the growth ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted in July,

but includes a higher range for credit. Alternatives I and III call for

somewhat higher and somewhat lower rates of growth, respectively, in the

monetary and credit aggregates.

Adopted in
Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III mid-1984

Ml 4 to 8 4 to 7 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 4 to 7

M2 6 to 9 6 to 8-1/2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 6 to 8-1/2

M3 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 6 to 9 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 6 to 9

Total credit 9-1/2 to 9 to 12 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 8 to 11
12-1/2

(8) The growth ranges of alternative II were taken as the basis

for the staff's projection of growth in nominal GNP for 1985 of 7-1/4 per-

cent; it was assumed that growth of M1 would be in the upper part of its

range, with interest rates expected to be around, or somewhat higher than,

current levels. Growth in the other monetary aggregates may be close to

the upper limits of their ranges, in part reflecting the strong expansion

1. A number of background issues in connection with monetary targets and
operating procedures in 1985 were discussed by the FOMC at its last
meeting. At that time, the Committee considered, in terms of Ml,
questions about the appropriate base for the 1985 range--whether it
should be the actual average level for the fourth quarter of 1984, as
assumed in the presentation of the alternatives, or the fourth-quarter
level that represents the midpoint of the 4 to 8 percent range for
last year. With growth for 1984 on a QIV to QIV basis at 5.2 percent,
the amount of "shortfall" from the 6 percent midpoint growth of last
year's range seems moderate enough to be readily compensated, should
the Committee wish, by encouraging growth in the upper part of whatever
range for 1985 is adopted.



expected in the first quarter. To the degree that interest rates rose

somewhat as the year progressed, M2 and M3 growth would more likely be

held within the ranges.

(9) The income velocity of M1 will probably increase much less

this year than in 1984, falling to a rate of increase of perhaps one per-

cent or so, to a degree reflecting a carry-through effect on the year of

the expected contraction of M1 velocity in the first quarter (as a result

of the lagged impact on money demand of late '84 interest rate declines).

So low a rate of increase for the year in velocity would also be noticeably

less than average experience in the third year of earlier expansions-a

period, however, when short-term interest rates in the past rose on aver-

age by about one-third, a rise that is not now expected in the current

expansion. The expected growth in M1 velocity over 1985 would be in the

neighborhood of, probably on the low side of, its likely long-run trend.

That trend may be currently estimated at 1 to 2 percent per year (abstrac-

ting from the impact of interest rate movements). However, uncertainties

remain about the trend rate of increase of Vl, as well as the velocity of

other monetary aggregates, given still limited experience under varying

economic circumstances in a deregulated environment. In light of the new

conditions affecting the reaction of both the public in their asset

preferences and depository institutions in their deposit pricing and

overall liability management, it is problematic to rely heavily on past

experience, and models of that experience, in estimating the interest and

income elasticities of money demand as well as the pace of financial

innovation.

(10) Credit growth under alternative II is expected to be just

below the upper end of the range shown. The higher range for credit



growth in alternative II than had been tentatively adopted provides a

greater chance of encompassing actual growth, but has the disadvantage of

possibly signalling to the market a more accommodative posture by the

Federal Reserve vis-a-vis the large federal budgetary deficit. Growth of

federal debt is expected to decelerate some in 1985, but to remain quite

high relative to historical experience, and to be faster than private

debt growth. Expansion in private debt is likely to be lower this year,

as growth of nominal GNP slows. But we still expect the rate of increase

in total debt to exceed expansion in nominal GNP by about as much as last

year. Debt growth is expected to be sustained by larger than normal

merger financing, though less than last year; by the still rapid expansion

of federal debt: a wider corporate financing gap; and by the continuing

need to finance an expansion of spending by domestic sectors that is

greater than the rise in nominal GNP (given the projected continued

deterioration in our international balance on goods and services).

(11) The lessened rate of debt expansion should help restrain

growth in the broad monetary aggregates, particularly M3. Given the

portfolio quality problems faced by depository institutions, and the need

to increase their capital, we do not expect them to be significantly more

aggressive than last year in seeking to finance credit demands. Part of

the increase in credit demands is also expected to continue to be met

by net borrowings from abroad by banks, displacing issuance of CDS or

other deposits that might appear in M3 (and possibly also M2). Nonethe-

less, as noted earlier, M2 and M3 are likely to grow close to the upper

limits of the proposed alternative II ranges. Somewhat higher growth

ranges for these aggregates would increase the odds of encompassing the

actual outcome for the year, providing leeway should credit demands fall



more heavily than expected on depository institutions or should funding

patterns change.

(12) Alternative I, which involves higher ranges than alternative

II, might also be considered as consistent with the GNP projection, pro-

vided expansion of M1 were at, or a little above, the midpoint of the

specified range. The approach of alternative I would also provide more

leeway for greater M1 growth should the Committee believe that is needed

to accommodate to a real GNP growth that is as rapid as, or more rapid

than, projections. However, growth of M1 toward the upper end of the

range may also generate stronger upward price pressures as it accommodates

greater demands for goods and services in a period when inflationary

expectations are not fully abated and when fiscal policy will probably

remain expansive. Under those conditions, if progress is to continue to

be made toward reasonable price stability, such an approach is likely to

limit real growth if not later in 1985, at least in 1986.

(13) Alternative III, by contrast, would be more consistent than

I or II with a policy tilted toward a slowing of Ml and M2 growth in 1985

relative to 1984 and encouraging a greater slowdown in growth of M3 and

credit. The marked tightening of credit market conditions, at least for

part of this year, that is probably consistent with this alternative

would work toward slower growth in real GNP in 1985 than in the staff

projection. However, this alternative would also foster more restraint

on price increases than under either alternatives I or II, which do not

entail a significant price deceleration this year or probably next. If

the deceleration of inflation under alternative III occurred at the

expense of a slower real GNP growth than currently projected, it would

nonetheless lay the groundwork for a stronger real growth later consistent



with continued abatement of inflation and inflationary expectations and a

lowering of interest rates over time.

(14) The preceding paragraphs have assumed that upward price

pressures in 1985 would be essentially no less than in 1984. However,

should they be less--because, for instance, oil and other commodity

prices weakened significantly further, the dollar remained high on exchange

markets, or the increase in labor costs was even smaller than expected--

nominal interest rates could well have to fall to maintain satisfactory

real GNP growth. As the decline in yields on bank deposits and money

market funds lagged the decline in market rates, demand for monetary

assets could be expected to increase, probably for a while more than

offsetting the lessened growth in money demand associated with slower

expansion in nominal GNP. Under such circumstances, the Committee might

need to be prepared for relatively rapid growth in M2, and to a degree

Ml, for a time. For the year as a whole, growth would probably be near

the upper end of, and possibly above, the ranges adopted, as the spread of

market rates over yields on money assets remained narrower in some cases

(such as demand deposits or NOW accounts) over the whole period and as

some of the funds that had initially moved into nontransactions monetary

assets remained there even as spreads returned to more normal proportions.

Prospective near-term developments

(15) The table below presents three alternative specifications

for growth in the monetary aggregates from December to March, along with

associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data can be found

on the table and charts on the following pages.) All the alternatives

call for a slowing in money growth over the next two months, but given

their rapid growth in December and January the aggregates in March would

be at levels above the upper ends of cones encompassing any of the longer-

term ranges discussed above.1 (Growth implied for QIV to March for each

alternative is given on the detailed table.)

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Growth from Dec.

to March
Ml 8-3/4 8 7-1/4
M2 11-1/2 10-1/2 9-1/2
M3 10-1/2 9-3/4 9

Federal funds
rate range 5 to 9 6 to 10 7 to 11

(16) The specifications of alternative B, which are expected

to involve continuation of about the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions, can be considered most consistent with growth over

a longer period within the ranges of alternative II. Under the speci-

fications of B, M1 growth would slow to around a 7-1/2 percent annual

rate on average over February and March. Such a moderation of M1 is

expected to develop without appreciable firming in money markets as the

1. All of the alternatives imply higher growth from November '84 to
March '85 than adopted by the Committee at its last meeting. In
terms of M1, attainment of the 7 percent November-March growth
rate previously adopted would require growth from December to
March of around 5-3/4 percent.

-12-

upward effects on money demand of the steep decline of interest rates

over recent months abate. Moreover, given the rapid growth of money late

in the fourth quarter and in January, a slowing in growth would still be

consistent with the expected increase in spending on goods and services

in the first quarter. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would increase at

a 9-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter under alternative B, and

velocity would decline at about a 1-1/4 percent annual rate, given the

staff's GNP projection. By March, M1 under this alternative would have

increased by about 8-3/4 percent from the QIV '84 long-run base.

(17) A less rapid expansion in the nontransactions components

of M2 and M3 is also expected to contribute to a slowdown in growth in the

broader monetary aggregates under alternative B. Weakness in inflows to

MMMFs is already evident in the most recent data, as yields on these

assets have declined into fairly close alignment with the lower level

of market interest rates; a similar pattern for MMDAs can be expected as

their offering rates continue to drop in response to previous declines in

other yields. As more normal rate alignments are restored, M2 growth

should slow considerably. However, M2 velocity in the first quarter

would decline at around a 4 percent annual rate under alternative B, owing

mostly to the surge in growth of this aggregate around year-end. M3 growth

is expected to be held down by continued moderate bank CD issuance as

well as weakness in institution-only money funds.

(18) The debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand

at around a 12-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter-still in

excess of GNP growth, but significantly below the very rapid pace of

borrowing in the fourth quarter. Growth in both private and federal debt

is expected to decelerate from the exceptionally rapid fourth-quarter



-13-

pace. Borrowing by state and local governments is anticipated to slow

sharply following its temporary surge at the end of last year, returning

to a pace more in line with the average of recent years. Household

credit usage may also ease off from its fourth-quarter pace, although

expansion of both mortgage and consumer debt is projected to continue to

outpace growth of disposable income. Borrowing to finance mergers and

stock repurchases is expected to continue at about the rate of second

half of last year, but underlying demands for funds by businesses may

strengthen, reflecting an increase in capital and inventory investment

while internal funds remain close to fourth-quarter levels. Federal debt

issuance is expected to be relatively large over the balance of the

quarter.

(19) The specifications of alternative B are expected to in-

volve reserve conditions consistent with borrowing at the discount window

remaining around $300 million. With borrowing remaining a little above

its frictional level, federal funds should trade in the neighborhood

of 8-1/4 percent. Nonborrowed and total reserves would increase at

12-1/4 and 11-1/2 percent annual rates, respectively, over the February-

March period.

(20) Short-term interest rates could decline a little over the

intermeeting period under this alternative, as continuation of the funds

rate and borrowing levels assumed allay same of the current concerns in

markets about a possible tightening of reserve positions over the weeks

ahead. The rate on 3-month Treasury bills could drop back to around 8

percent, while 3-month CDs fall to about 8-1/4 percent. Bond prices

could improve somewhat following their recent drop. However, increases

are likely to be limited by still pervasive uncertainties about the



-14-

federal budget, by strength in money relative to long-run target ranges,

and an economic outlook that is not at the moment weakening.

(21) Alternative A, which contemplates that M1 growth will

slow relatively little from the December-January average to around an

8-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March, seems most consistent

with long-run alternative I. Borrowing at the discount window might be

reduced to its frictional level--about $100-200 million at present.

However, a further reduction in the discount rate, or provision of above

average excess reserves through open market operations at least for a

while, may also be needed if the federal funds rate is to drop nearer to

the 7-1/2 percent area that seems more consistent with the reserve growth

needed to attain the money specifications of this alternative. Non-

borrowed reserves would be expected to grow at about a 20 percent

annual rate over the February-March period.

(22) Market interest rates would be expected to drop fairly

sharply in the near term under alternative A, especially if it was

accompanied by a lower discount rate. The Treasury bill rate might

decline to around 7-1/4 percent and CDs to about 7-1/2 percent, putting

the prime rate under considerable downward pressure. Such yield declines

would probably lead to continued strong growth of M2 and M3, particularly

of their nontransactions components. In long-term markets, yields would

also fall, though the extent of such declines might be reduced by the

very heavy volume of corporate and state and local bond issuance that

would probably ensue. In addition, rate declines in long-term markets

could be limited by concerns that such an approach might lead to an

intensification of inflationary pressures, or in any event to a tightening

of market conditions later in the year to avert such pressures and to



-15-

constrain growth in the aggregates to within the long-term ranges adopted.

In exchange markets, the dollar would be likely to come under downward

pressure.

(23) Alternative C specifies a sharper slowing of money growth

in February and March, consistent with a more rapid return of the

aggregates toward their longer-run ranges, an approach that may be

particularly in line with a Comittee choice of long-run alternative

III. M1 growth of around 6-1/4 percent over February and March under this

alternative would require restraining growth in total reserves to a 7

percent annual rate. This may be consistent with growth of nonborrowed

reserves of 2-1/2 percent, and a rise in borrowing to the $600-700 million

area. The federal funds rate would probably rise to around 9 percent.

(24) Other interest rates would also be expected to rise

substantially under alternative C, with the Treasury bill rate increasing

to around 8-3/4 percent. Long-term rates are also likely to advance

significantly in the short run. Upward pressures on the dollar on foreign

exchange markets would intensify, and U.S. trading partners also would

be under pressure to raise short-term rates.

Directive language

(25) Given below is draft directive language related to the

Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the

operating paragraph is shown in (26) below). Suggested deletions from

the current directive are shown in strike-through form with proposed

additions in caps and certain alternatives in brackets. The considerable

uncertainties that still remain in interpreting M1 and the other aggregate

given ongoing adaptation to institutional changes by banks and the public,

appear to be clearly encompassed by the language of the second paragraph

below. With regard to Ml, the lagnuage in brackets is suggested should

the Committee wish to indicate an expectation that M1 may be in the upper

part of its range.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary

and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute

to an improved pattern of international transactions. In further-

ance of these objectives the Committee agreed at THIS [DEL: the July]

meeting to ESTABLISH [DEL: reaffirm] ranges for monetary growth OF [DEL: that

it had established in January: 4-to-8] ___ TO ___ percent for

M1, [DEL: and-6-to 9] ____ TO ____ percent for [DEL: both] M2, and ____ TO ____

PERCENT FOR M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of [DEL: 1983]

1984 to the fourth quarter of [DEL: 1984] 1985. The associated range

for total domestic nonfinancial debt was SET [DEL: also reaffirmed] at

[DEL: 8 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent for the year [DEL: 1984] 1985. [THE COMMITTEE

AGREED THAT GROWTH OF M1 IN THE UPPER PART OF ITS RANGE FOR

1985 MAY BE APPROPRIATE, GIVEN GROWTH OF THAT AGGREGATE IN THE

LOWER PORTION OF ITS RANGE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. [DEL: It was



-17-

anticipated that-M3 and nonfincial debt might increase at rates

somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given

develepments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt

that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks

for evaluating longer term trends in M2 and credit growth. For

1985 the- Committee- agreed-en- tentative-ranges-of -monetary-growth,

measured-from the-fourth-quarter-of-1984-to-the-fourth-quarter

of-1985,-of-4-to-7-percent-for-M1 -6-to-8-l/2-percent for-M2,

and-6-to 9- percent-for M3. The associated range for nonfinancia1

debt-was- set- at- 8- to-11-perent.]

The Committee understood that policy implementation would

require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among

the various measures of money and credit but also between those

aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluations of conditions

in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

(26) In the implementation of policy in the short run, the

Cammittee seeks to reduce SOMEWHAT (ALT. A)/MAINTAIN (ALT. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (ALT. C) pressures on reserve positions. THIS

ACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE consistent with growth of M1, M2, and M3

at annual rates of around [DEL: 7, 9, and 9] ____,____. AND ____ percent,

respectively, during the period from [DEL: November] DECEMBER to March.

LESSER RESTRAINT ON RESERVE POSITIONS [DEL: somewhat-more-rapid-growth

of-M1] would [MIGHT] be acceptable IN THE EVENT OF SUBSTANTIALLY

SLOWER GROWTH IN THE MONETARY AGGREGATES, EVALUATED [DEL: in light of

the currently estimated shortfall in growth for the fourth quarter

relative-to- the- Committee's expectations at the beginning of the



-18-

period, particularly] in the context of sluggish growth in

economic activity and continued strength of the dollar in

FOREIGN exchange markets. Greater restraint on reserve

positions might [WOULD] be acceptable in the event of sub-

stantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of

significant strengthening of economic activity and infla-

tionary pressures. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and

related reserve paths during the period before the next

meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of [DEL: 6 to 10] ___ TO ____ percent.



Appendix I

Money Stock Revisions

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate

annual seasonal and benchmark adjustments. This appendix discusses the

revisions and presents tables comparing growth rates of the old and

new series. These revisions are to be regarded as strictly confidential

until their release planned for Thursday, February 14.

Benchmark Revisions

Deposits have been benchmarked to recent call reports; call reports

used for commercial banks span the period from mid-1983 to mid-1984 while

those used for thrift institutions begin at an earlier date. In addition, a

new survey has been used to benchmark RPs. The net impact of benchmark

revisions has been to raise growth of the aggregates by relatively small

amounts in 1984 and also in 1983. In the case of M3, where benchmark

revisions are largest, the most important source of revision was term

RPs at thrifts, which now incorporate information from the new RP survey.

Seasonal Revisions

Revisions to seasonal factors were based on an X-11 ARIMA procedure

used in recent years. Following the practice introduced last year, nontrans-

actions M2 has been seasonally adjusted as a whole-instead of being built

up from seasonally adjusted savings and small time deposits-to reduce dis-

tortions caused by sizable portfolio shifts in recent years; a similar

procedure has been used to seasonally adjust the non-M2 portion of M3.



-A2-

Revisions to seasonal factors had a greater impact on the pattern

of M1 growth last year than on growth in the broader aggregates, a typical

occurrence. On a quarterly average basis, M1 growth was reduced about 1-1/4

percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 1984 and boosted in the

fourth quarter by a similar amount.
