Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1 increased at an 8.6 percent annual rate in November,

offsetting the sharp October contraction; transactions deposits surged last

month, but currency growth again was sluggish. Preliminary data for early

December suggest at this point moderate growth for the month, leaving expan-

sion of this aggregate over the September-to-December period a little under

the 3 percent minimum rate specified by the FOMC. On a quarterly average

basis, M1 in the fourth quarter will grow at only about a 1-1/2 percent

annual rate, well below predictions of econometric models given estimates

of income and the recent decline in interest rates, and velocity would in-

crease at an annual rate of about 4 percent. For the year 1984, M1 likely

will expand by about 5 percent on a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis,

in the lower half of its 4 to 8 percent longer-run range, as shown in the

table below.

(2) M2 surged in November at a 15 percent annual rate, reflecting

strengthening of its nontransactions component as well as of M1. The non-

transactions component was swelled by very heavy inflows to MMDAs and money

funds, whose yields lagged declines on market rates. M2 appears to be

expanding in December at close to the November pace, and growth over the

September-to-December period is likely to be well in excess of the FOMC's

7-1/2 percent short-run path. For the year as a whole, the staff estimates

that M2 will have increased by about 7-1/2 percent, at the middle of its

longer-run range.

(3) M3 grew at a 16 percent annual rate in November, spurred by

expansion in its non-M2 as well as M2 components. The non-M2 component was

dominated by flows into institution-only money funds. Issuance of new CDs

by commercial banks virtually ceased, given the robust expansion in core

deposits and a large inflow of Treasury deposits, but thrift institutions

remained heavy issuers of large time deposits. Although partial data suggest

some moderation in M3 growth in December, this aggregate is running consider-

ably above its short-run September-to-December path of 9 percent, and for the

year will grow around 10 percent, above its 6 to 9 percent range.

(4) Expansion in domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated

(on the basis of partial data) to have accelerated to about a 14 percent

annual rate in November, reflecting a pick-up in federal government borrowing

and continued rapid growth in the debt of nonfederal sectors. Corporate bond

offerings in the domestic and Euromarkets were at record levels, and business

borrowing in short-term markets also was sizable, in part to finance new

mergers; sales of municipal revenue bonds continued heavy as year-end

approached. Borrowing by households is estimated to have remained near the

substantial third-quarter volume, but down from the very rapid pace of the

first half of the year. Total nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow

at about a 13-1/4 percent rate in 1984; perhaps about one percentage point

of this growth can be attributed to financing of corporate mergers, share

repurchases, and buyouts in excess of the usual volume of such activity.



-4-

(5) Nonborrowed reserves paths for the intermeeting period were

initially constructed assuming $575 million of adjustment and seasonal bor-

rowing at the discount window; in view of the weakness in M1, as well as

further evidence of sluggish economic expansion, subdued price increases,

and the continued strength of the dollar on exchange markets, the borrow-

ing assumption was reduced to $500 million, and then to $400 million in the

course of the intermeeting period. Actual borrowing came in somewhat above

the amount assumed in the latter part of November, but free reserves increased

about as implied by reserve paths, as excess reserves were higher than antici-

pated. The actual average level of borrowing fell $180 million in November,

contributing to an increase in nonborrowed reserves of 17-1/2 percent at an

annual rate; total reserves grew 11-1/4 percent in November. So far in the

current reserve period borrowing has averaged under $300 million.

(6) The decline in borrowing along with a reduction in the dis-

count rate from 9 to 8-1/2 percent on November 21 led to a drop in the federal

funds rate from about 9-3/4 percent at the time of the November FOMC meeting

to around 8-3/4 percent recently, with trading in the last two days below

8-1/2 percent. Other market interest rates also have continued to move

down. Short-term interest rates have declined another 45 to 60 basis points.

Declines were smaller in intermediate- and long-term credit markets, which

have been affected by uncertainties about future federal budget deficits and

at times by economic indicators that were stronger than expected. Since the

November meeting, rates in the note and bond market are down only a little

at the long end, while dropping about 50 basis points at the shorter end.

The prime rate was trimmed by a total of 75 basis points during the period,

but remained high relative to the cost of funds.

(7) The dollar has appreciated, on a weighted average basis, by

about 4-1/2 percent since the last FOMC meeting and is currently only one



-5-

percent below its October peak, even though short-term interest differentials

in favor of dollar assets have narrowed.

Prospective developments

(8) The table below presents three alternative specifications

for growth of the monetary aggregates from November to March, along with

associated federal funds rate ranges. A November base is suggested in

view of the considerable uncertainties this early in the month about the

December level. (More detailed data, including implied growth rates to

March from projected December levels and from the estimated QIV '84 level,

can be found on the charts and table on the following pages.)

M2 9-1/2 8-1/2 7-1/2
M3 9 8-1/2 8

Federal funds
rate range 6 to 10 7 to 11 8 to 12

(9) The aggregates specifications of alternative B, which are

expected to be consistent with maintenance of about the current degree of

pressure on reserve positions, would place all of the money supply measures

in March close to the upper limits of their tentative longer-run ranges

for 1985 established last July. Growth of M1 under this alternative from

November to March would be expected to be at about a 6-3/4 percent annual

rate. The acceleration of M1 growth from the slower pace that has pre-

vailed on average since around mid-year reflects strengthened transactions

demands, given the projected pickup in GNP growth, as well as the lagged

effects of the sizable drop in short-term rates over recent months. The

income velocity of M1 would be about unchanged in the first quarter.

Some models, on the other hand, suggest a drop in income velocity, associ-

ated with higher money growth at current interest rates, because they

embody greater responsiveness of M1 to earlier interest rate declines.

-8-

We have assumed, however, a more moderate M1 growth partly because its

recent behavior suggests the possibility that the demand for narrow money

may have become a little less responsive to interest rate changes.

(10) Despite the pickup in M1 growth under this alternative

during the first quarter, the broad monetary aggregates are expected

to decelerate from their unusually rapid rate of late 1984 to a pace more

nearly in keeping with growth rates prior to the fourth quarter of this

year, and in the case of M3 somewhat below such rates. Inflows to MMDAs

and MMMFs should drop off considerably as the first quarter progresses as

yields on these instruments decline into more normal alignment with

market interest rates. As a partial offset to reduced growth in core

deposits, CD issuance by banks is expected to pick up, after showing

virtually no growth late this year. We do not expect the broad aggregates

to be affected to any significant extent by the reduction from $2,500 to

$1,000 in the minimum balance requirement for MMDAs and super-NOW accounts.

Transfers into these accounts are likely to be relatively small, with the

great bulk coming from other components of M2. We have also assumed a

minimal net effect on M1 as inflows from non-M1 deposits into new super-

NOWs may be about offset by shifts out of smaller transactions accounts

into new MMDAs.

(11) The growth of debt of nonfinancial sectors in the first

quarter of next year, although slowing somewhat from the pace of late 1984,

may also be around the top of its tentative 8 to 11 percent range. In

part, the moderation in credit growth projected for early next year

reflects a drop in tax-exempt borrowing by state and local governments

and businesses, following a surge in the fourth quarter in advance of

various legislative year-end deadlines. In addition, growth of Treasury



-9-

debt, while remaining large, is expected to moderate sane from its recent

advanced pace. Underlying business needs for credit are expected to

continue at close to the level of the last half of 1984, and recent

announcements seem to indicate that borrowing to finance corporate mergers

and share retirements will remain sizable in the months ahead. The pace

of mortgage lending to households, which had been slowing since the spring

of 1984, is projected to stabilize in response to the easier conditions

that have developed in that market.

(12) Discount window borrowing under alternative B is expected

to average around $400 million. That level of borrowing appears to be

somewhat in excess of the likely "frictional" level, which now is probably

around $150 to $250 million. Seasonal borrowing has declined to close to

$100 million since the last FOMC meeting in accord with its normal seasonal

pattern and in response to the slimmer spread between market and discount

rates. Under these circumstances, federal funds might average mostly in

a range around 8-3/4 percent. Nonborrowed reserves would be expected to

increase at a 16 percent annual rate, and total reserves at a 12-1/2 percent

rate over the November-to-March period.

(13) Short-term rates are not likely to show much change on

balance over the intermeeting period under alternative B, with the 3-month

Treasury bill rate generally in an 8-1/8 to 8-3/8 percent range; the prime

rate may drop a little further, given current rate relationships. In

long-term markets, yields could move somewhat higher should there be no

real progress toward putting together a credible deficit reduction package,

if there were signs of strengthened economic activity, and if M1 growth

were sustained as expected under alternative B. Mortgage rates may

stabilize in the period immediately ahead, and could begin to rise, parti-

cularly should bond rates turn up as the first quarter progresses.



- 10 -

(14) Alternative A involves growth in the aggregates that

would bring them above the upper limits of their tentative longer-run ranges

(the width of the ranges of course being narrow early in the year). This

alternative may also be viewed as compensating in some degree for the

recent shortfall in M1 growth. For instance, the 8 percent growth of M1

over November to March that is specified would bring it by March to a

level that would be near the midpoint of the FOMC's tentative long-run

growth range if that range were based not on the actual fourth-quarter

average but on the fourth-quarter midpoint level of the 1984 long-run

range. The more rapid growth of M2 under this alternative would reflect,

in addition to faster expansion of its M1 component, continued strong

inflows to MMDAs and money market mutual funds, given the further drop

assumed in market rates and the lag in reduction of yields on these

instruments.

(15) The money supply specifications of alternative A are

expected to entail an increase in total reserves of about 15 percent at

an annual rate from November to March, accompanied by a drop in the funds

rate to 8 percent or a little below. Absent a decline in the discount

rate, discount window borrowing is likely to be at a bare minimum, and

excess reserves perhaps somewhat higher than usual, with nonborrowed

reserves rising at about a 21 percent annual rate through March. If

the discount rate were reduced from the present 8-1/2 percent level,

reserve growth consistent with this alternative could be accomplished

with somewhat less expansion in nonborrowed reserves than otherwise.

Under this alternative, the 3-month Treasury bill rate may drop to around

7-1/2 percent, but yield declines in long-term markets may be more limited.

The dollar probably would come under downward pressure in foreign exchange



- 11 -

markets, although any depreciation would be moderated if foreign monetary

authorities allowed their domestic rates to fall as well under the circum-

stances.

(16) Alternative C is designed to hold growth of M1 and M2 to

rates close to the midpoints of their tentative long-run ranges and is

expected to involve some tightening of reserve conditions. Borrowing

might rise back toward $800 million, with the federal funds rate returning

to the 9-1/2 to 10 percent area. Nonborrowed and total reserves would

increase at rates of around 10 percent from November to March. Such a

change in reserve conditions at this time would be quite unexpected by

market participants, and both short- and long-term rates would back up

considerably, with Treasury bill rates rising almost a percentage point

to 9 percent or a bit higher. Rates on private instruments might increase

by even more should investor concerns about creditworthiness be revived.

The dollar would probably rise further on foreign exchange markets.



- 12 -

Directive language

(17) Proposed language for the operational paragraph, with

alternatives, is shown below. The language in brackets is proposed

should the Committee wish to provide flexibility on the up side for

growth in M1 in light of the currently estimated shortfall over the

fourth quarter relative to the FOMC's original expectation for that

period, as was done in the November directive. The bracketed language

would seem to be more relevant to alternatives B or C, since alternative

A contains a growth rate for M1 from November to March that, as de-

scribed in paragraph (14), already takes more account of the shortfall.

In the implementation of policy in the short run, the

Ccmmittee seeks to reduce somewhat (alt. A)/MAINTAIN (alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (alt. C) existing pressures on reserve positions.

This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M1, M2, and

M3 at annual rates of around [DEL: 7-1/2 and 9] ____, ____, and ____ percent,

RESPECTIVELY, during the period from [DEL: September to December] NOVEMBER

TO MARCH. [DEL: M1 is expected to grow over the period at an annual rate

of around 3 percent, less than anticipated earlierin view of the

decline in October. In light of that decline, more rapid growth of

M1 would be acceptable.] [SOMEWHAT MORE RAPID GROWTH OF M1 WOULD BE

ACCEPTABLE IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED SHORTFALL IN GROWTH

FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER RELATIVE TO THE COMMITTEE'S EXPECTATIONS AT

THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD.] Lesser restraint on reserve positions

would be sought in the event of significantly slower growth in the

monetary aggregates, evaluated in relation to the strength of the

business expansion and inflationary pressures, domestic and inter-

national financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth.



- 13 -

Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of

substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of significant

strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures. The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting

is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: 7 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent.
