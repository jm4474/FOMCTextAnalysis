MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Strictly Confidential (FR) June 28, 1996
Class I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's decision at the last FOMC meeting to

leave the intended federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 percent was

widely expected and prompted little response in market interest

rates. Following the release in early June of the strong employ-

ment report for May, however, market yields resumed the uptrend that

began this past February, increasing as much as 30 basis points during

the intermeeting period; in recent days, though, that rise has been

largely rolled back, as expectations of System tightening ebbed, and

on balance most rates are up only 5 to 10 basis points (chart).

Markets still seem to incorporate modest policy firming over the

balance of the year, as is evident in the trajectory of quotes on

federal funds futures. Stock prices have generally fallen, with

notable declines in the high-tech and small-capitalization sectors.

(2) The increases in interest rates since the last meeting

bring the upward movement over the period since January 31, the day of

1. Over the intermeeting period, federal funds generally traded
close to the Committee's intended rate, and the rate averaged 5.29
percent. Adjustment and seasonal borrowing averaged $150 million
above its allowance in the two complete reserve maintenance periods
ending since the last Committee meeting, with the overage primarily
reflecting a shortfall in nonborrowed reserves in the period ending
June 19. On the last day of that period, an apparent shortage of
dealer collateral limited the Desk's ability to inject reserves,
leading to a spike in the funds rate and a surge in borrowing.
Separately, in order to accommodate the usual springtime upswing in
seasonal borrowing, the allowance for borrowing was raised by $125
million in three steps over the intermeeting period to a level of $225
million.

Although banks have continued to implement new retail sweep pro-
grams, required reserve balances have fallen only slightly over the
intermeeting period, owing to a surprising surge in demand deposits,
while required clearing balances have edged up. These developments
have left the sum of required reserve and required clearing balances
about unchanged.

the Committee's last policy move, to about 7/8 to 1-1/4 percentage

points at intermediate and long maturities; short-term rates, anchored

by the federal funds rate, rose considerably less. This pattern was

reflected in substantial increases in one-year forward rates at all

horizons. An especially sharp bulge in forward rates in the three-

year area is consistent with the interpretation that the increase in

yields was primarily a response to signs of cyclical strength in the

economy. Judging from the available survey data, long-term inflation

expectations have deteriorated little, if at all, and thus the in-

crease in nominal long-term rates seems to represent primarily higher

real interest rates. Shorter-term inflation expectations are flat to

up slightly on these survey measures since early in the year, implying

that the real federal funds rate since the last easing has held steady

or fallen a bit. At its current level, however, the real funds rate

is only a little below its level last June, because part of the reduc-

tion in the nominal funds rate since then has been offset by declines

in short-term inflation expectations over the second half of last

year.

(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value slipped

about 3/4 percent over the intermeeting period. The dollar declined

moderately against the German mark and other European currencies as

accumulating signs of a pickup in economic growth in Germany prompted

a reduction in expectations of any further easing of German monetary

policy. Ten-year government bond yields in Germany rose 20 basis

points over the intermeeting period. The dollar firmed 2-3/4 percent

against the yen, despite the much larger-than-expected gain in first-

quarter Japanese GDP. Various statements by Japanese officials

indicated that Japanese monetary policy would not be tightened until

the recovery proved self-sustaining; as a result, Japanese bond yields



declined slightly, on balance, over the period.

; the Desk did not

intervene. Since the end of January the dollar has risen 1/2 percent

on balance, placing it in the middle of its range of fluctuations over

nearly a decade.

(4) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt has decelerated in the

past few months, bringing this measure to just below the middle of its

3 to 7 percent annual range. Federal debt growth has been particular-

ly damped over the second quarter, owing mainly to unexpectedly strong

tax receipts. Nonfederal borrowing also is estimated to have edged

down. Consumer credit growth appears to be slowing, although it

continues to outpace income. Home mortgage borrowing to date, how-

ever, has been well maintained and has yet to show any perceptible

response to the rise in mortgage interest rates. Business borrowing

was slower in the second quarter, as merger activity and associated

share retirements dropped substantially. In general, funding for both

households and businesses appears to remain readily available.

Spreads on junk and investment-grade bonds and mortgage-backed securi-

ties have stayed narrow. Terms on bank loans are generally attrac-

tive, and banks seem to be tightening standards only selectively,

mainly for credit cards. Equity markets also have been highly recep-

tive, at least until very recently, and equity issuance--especially

through initial public offerings--has been robust over the quarter,

holding down credit needs.

(5) The broad monetary aggregates remained weak in May fol-

lowing relatively slow growth in April, apparently reflecting the



drawdown of balances to meet unusually large individual tax liabili-

ties. Preliminary data, however, suggest that both M2 and M3 have

rebounded in June to annual rates of about 5-1/2 and 6 percent,

respectively. The pickup was spread widely across the components of

these aggregates, including M1. The latter has registered a small

upturn following two months of decline, as currency has accelerated

2
and demand deposits have shown surprising strength. Among the

non-M1 components of M2 and M3, money market mutual funds have been

particularly robust.

(6) From the fourth quarter of 1995 through June, M2 has

grown at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate, leaving it just below the upper

end of its 1 to 5 percent annual range. M3 has increased at a

6-1/4 percent rate over this period, placing it a bit above its 2 to 6

percent range. M2 growth so far this year has been quite close to the

staff forecast prepared in advance of the January meeting. Nominal

GDP growth over the first two quarters of the year, however, appears

to have been a bit stronger than expected last January. As a conse-

quence, the velocity of M2 has been a little higher than projected,

declining only slightly rather than falling at a 3/4 percent annual

rate. This firmer velocity has likely reflected the depressing

effects on money demand of unusually sluggish upward adjustment of

deposit interest rates as well as of higher expected yields on market

instruments. Consistent with this interpretation, flows into stock

2. Net shipments abroad of U.S. currency turned positive in May
(most recent available data) but stayed weak compared with the average
of previous years. Adjusted for sweep accounts, M1 has expanded at a
9-3/4 percent annual rate in June.

3. M1 has fallen at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate from the fourth
quarter through June while the monetary base has increased at a 2
percent pace. Adjusted for the introduction of sweep accounts, these
two measures increased at 7-1/4 and 4-1/2 percent rates, respectively.



mutual funds were very heavy in the first half of the year and noncom-

petitive tenders at Treasury bill and note auctions have picked up as

well.4  In contrast to M2 expansion, the growth of M3 has been

stronger than expected over the first half. While the increase in

bank credit was significantly slower than projected, in part owing to

downward revaluations of investment portfolios, banks have substan-

tially reduced their reliance on nondeposit funding this year, prob-

ably in response to the elimination of deposit insurance premiums last

fall.

4. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds has expanded at an 7-3/4
percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1995 through June, and its
velocity declined at an estimated 3 percent pace over the first two
quarters of 1996.

Long-Run Scenarios

(7) This section examines the monetary policies needed to

achieve alternative objectives for inflation over the long run.

Specifically, the first set of scenarios compares two approaches for

maintaining inflation around the rate forecast to prevail at the end

of the Greenbook projection period. The second set of scenarios

addresses issues related to achieving effective price stability over

the next five years or so.

(8) The new staff econometric model of the U.S. economy

(FRB/US) was used to extend the baseline forecast beyond the Greenbook

horizon and to derive the effects of alternative policies.5 One of

the distinguishing characteristics of the new model is the process of

expectations formations. Participants in labor, product, and finan-

cial markets use the information at their disposal to make projections

of future events in a much more complex fashion than in the staff's

previous large-scale model (the MPS model), in which expectations were

adaptive and not distinguished from other sources of sluggish adjust-

ment. For the purposes of the exercises in this section, the manner

of forming inflation expectations is especially important: Partici-

pants use historical relationships among interest rates, prices and

output along with a notion of where inflation will be in the distant

future to forecast a path for prices and the economy; long-run infla-

tion expectations in turn can depend on actual inflation, but the

model also allows them to be influenced by announced objectives of the

monetary authority. Aside from the contributions of expectations,

5. The new model still is in the final stages of development.
Although the results thus should be considered provisional, the old
MPS model is not being maintained. Model simulations in past Blue-
books used the combined MPS and multi-country models. A project link-
ing the new FRB/US model to the newly revised multi-country model is
underway, but a combined model was not available for these exercises.



wage and price adjustments are influenced by labor and product market

frictions, imparting real effects even to anticipated policy actions.

(9) The simulations share a common NAIRU of around 5-3/4

percent. The sacrifice ratio varies, however, depending on the ele-

ments influencing long-term inflation expectations. For the model

relationships embodied in Chart 2, which do not have monetary policy

credibility effects, the sacrifice ratio is 2-1/2--that is, reducing

inflation by 1 percentage point would require unemployment to exceed

the NAIRU by 1 percentage point for 2-1/2 years. By assumption, fis-

cal policy in all the scenarios moves slightly in a stimulative direc-

tion over the extended forecast period, as indexed by a rise in the

NIPA Federal government current account deficit in the steady infla-

tion cases to 2-1/2 percent of GDP from 1-3/4 percent in 1997. The

model's implied equilibrium real funds rate stays close to 2-3/4

percent, with the effects of mild fiscal stimulus offset by the

influence of an assumed steady real dollar on the foreign side, which,

with the relatively high income elasticities for U.S. imports, tends

to induce faster growth of imports than exports.

(10) The baseline strategy, shown by the solid line in

Chart 2, follows the Greenbook through 1997, by which time inflation,

as measured by the chain-weight PCE price index, is expected to have

edged up to nearly a 3 percent rate (from 2.2 percent in 1995). With

the nominal federal funds rate fixed and inflation rising, real short-

term interest rates fall over 1997 and would continue that downward

course absent a tightening of monetary policy. But the disequilibrium

is not large, and a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate

in early 1998 raises real short- and long-term rates by enough to

induce an increase in the unemployment rate to its natural level in

1999, flattening out the path of inflation. Under the alternative

near-term tightening strategy, the Committee begins to tighten sooner,

following a Taylor rule adjusted to embody the 2-3/4 percent equi-

librium real interest rate implied by the simulations and a 3 percent

target for the increases in the PCE chain-weight index. Nominal and

real rates begin to rise immediately, so that the unemployment rate is

higher in the near term than in the Greenbook and inflation levels are

a little lower. Starting sooner also implies that both nominal and

real interest rates do not have to climb as high in the middle years

of the simulation.

(11) Chart 3 considers policies aimed at achieving effective

price stability by reducing measured inflation to around 1 percent

early in the next decade. The three scenarios illustrate the effects

of different processes by which the public's expectations of inflation

adjust to this policy goal. In the circumstances illustrated by the

dotted line (low credibility), perceptions of the eventual inflation

rate are formed by observing actual inflation, as they were for

Chart 2: Inflation expectations adjust down to 1 percent, but they do

so slowly, and the central bank's target plays no role in this process

except to discipline its actions and hence inflation outcomes. In

this case, the funds rate needs to rise more than a percentage point,

and the unemployment rate increases about a percentage point, running

at about 6-1/2 percent for a while. The dashed line shows a high

credibility case in which the public's expectation of where inflation

will be in the long term is quickly lowered to the 1 per-

cent objective established and presumably announced by the Federal

Reserve. Owing primarily to frictions in labor and product markets,

even with high credibility it takes several years for inflation to

move to 1 percent, and unemployment rises slightly above the natural

rate. The sacrifice ratio is only about 1 and it would be even lower

if the disinflation process were stretched out further. The dot-dash

line (earning credibility) gives an intermediate case. Initially, the

public forms expectations much as in the scenario shown with the solid

line. But the Federal Reserve earns increasing credibility for its 1

percent inflation target as actual inflation is reduced. As might be

expected, cumulative output losses are below the two other cases.

While these simulations illustrate the potentially powerful effects of

inducing the public to reduce inflation expectations faster than they

would by observing actual inflation outcomes, they provide no guidance

on how to accomplish this. As noted in the report to the FOMC on "The

Price Objective for Monetary Policy", empirical evidence of credi-

bility effects of announced inflation targets is difficult to find.

Long-Run Ranges

(12) The table below provides background for the Committee's

discussion of growth rate ranges for the monetary and debt aggregates

for 1996 and 1997. The staff baseline projections for money and debt

are based on the Greenbook forecast of the economy. In terms of the

outlook for money growth, the key elements in that forecast are the

federal funds rate remaining at 5-1/4 percent through next year, long-

term interest rates staying around current levels, and nominal GDP

growing at a rate close to 4-1/2 percent over each of the next six

quarters.

(13) M2 is projected to outrun nominal GDP slightly over the

forecast period, leaving growth for 1996 at about 5 percent and at

around that same pace next year.6 Interest rates on small time

deposits, which have been rising, are still unusually low relative to

market interest rates and should continue to move higher. If the

historical money demand relationship prevails, this edging lower of

the opportunity cost of M2 relative to short-term interest rates

should work to reduce the velocity of M2 a little. In fact, the his-

torical relationship between movements in M2's opportunity cost and

in its velocity appears to have reasserted itself in recent years

after having gone off track in the early part of this decade

(chart 4 ). The staff's working assumption is that this rela-

tionship will continue to hold, though the increased availability of

alternative financial instruments and the changes in household balance

sheets over the last decade suggest that considerable uncertainty

remains about the characteristics of M2 demand.

(14) Unlike M2, M3 is seen as moderating over the second half

of this year to a little more than a 5 percent rate, bringing its

growth over the four quarters of the year down to 6 percent. Shifts

of funding from Eurodollar borrowing to large time deposits, which

apparently had been encouraged in part by the removal of the deposit

insurance premiums for commercial banks last year, are expected to

6. M1 is expected to fall over the rest of the year at a 1-1/2
percent rate, comparable to its decline over the first half, before
leveling out next year. Adjusted for the effects of sweeps of OCDs
into MMDAs, M1 is projected to expand at a 6-3/4 percent rate in the
second half of this year and by 5 percent next year. The initial
effects on M1 of new retail sweep programs are projected to cumulate
to $215 billion by the end of next year.

7. Along with short-term interest rates in general, rates on liquid
retail deposits are likely to continue about unchanged.

8. Historical velocity behavior, as well as projected values, for
all the key monetary and credit aggregates is shown in Appendix A.

ebb. In addition, inflows to money market mutual funds, which had

been boosted by the drop in short-term market rates resulting from

policy easings in late 1995 and early 1996, should be moderate with

short-term market rates about unchanged. Next year, M3 expansion is

projected to strengthen from its second-half pace to a 6 percent rate,

as bank credit growth picks up.

(15) The growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors

is projected to be 4-1/2 percent over both this year and next. The

expansion of the debt of nonfederal sectors over the next six quarters

slows relative to the first half of 1996, along with nominal income.

While equity is anticipated to be retired at a hefty pace, the cor-

porate financing gap over the balance of 1996 and 1997 is expected to

remain relatively low owing to restrained inventory investment and

rising internal funds. The staff does not foresee any pullback in

credit supplies to businesses, whose outlook for earnings and debt

servicing seems favorable. In contrast, in light of rising delin-

quency rates on consumer credit--especially the revolving component--

households may well face a further tightening of the availability of

certain types of consumer credit. This contributes to slowing growth

of such credit in coming quarters, but only a little--most of the

deceleration reflects spending trends and rising repayments from debt

assumed earlier. Home mortgage debt expansion later this year and in

1997 should fall below the first-half pace as the increases to date in

mortgage rates exert more noticeable restraint. Debt of the state and

local government sector will continue to contract over the remainder

of this year and next owing to the large volume of advance refunded

bonds still scheduled to be retired. Federal debt should grow more



-14-

slowly this year than last, but it is likely to be picking up by 1997

because of projected increases in the federal budget deficit.

(16) The money and credit projections for the "tighter"

strategy are consistent with the alternative scenario presented in the

Greenbook Part I in which the federal funds rate is raised gradually,

by a total of 100 basis points by year-end, and maintained at that

level through next year. The more restrictive policy damps nominal

GDP growth by about a percentage point over the next six quarters.

The slower spending growth, together with the higher opportunity costs

of holding liquid money balances generated by sluggish upward adjust-

ment of rates on retail deposits, should hold M2 growth to 4-1/2 and

3 percent over this year and next, respectively. Much, but not all,

of the slowdown in M2 would show through to M3; bank credit and

associated funding needs would moderate only a bit, leading banks

to rely more heavily on managed liabilities in M3 to make up for some

of the shortfall in funding from M2 sources. The expansion in the

debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors would likely be retarded next

year to about the same extent as growth in nominal spending, posting

a projected rate of growth of 3-1/2 percent.

(17) The table on page 11 presents two alternatives for money

and credit ranges for 1996 and 1997. The Committee first selected the

alternative I growth rate ranges for 1996 of 1 to 5 percent for M2,

2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for debt on a provisional

basis at its meeting a year ago, and it reaffirmed these ranges at its

9
meeting in late January of this year. The debt range was reason-

ably well centered on the likely outcomes for growth in this measure

under staff or Committee members' economic forecasts, and it remains

money and credit since 1979.



-15-

so unless policy tightens very substantially. When the Committee

chose its 1996 M2 and M3 ranges in July and January, however, it

recognized that staff baseline projections of these aggregates were in

the neighborhood of the upper ends of these ranges. The Committee's

rationale was to provide a benchmark for secular growth of the broader

monetary aggregates that, in the words of the Federal Reserve Act,

would be "commensurate with the economy's long run potential to in-

crease production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum

employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates"

under the assumption of historically typical velocity behavior. The

Monetary Policy Reports to the Congress after those meetings indicated

that growth of the broader aggregates might run near the upper ends of

their ranges. A very similar situation confronts the Committee at

this meeting, with the baseline staff forecast for M2 and M3 for both

this year and next at the 5 and 6 percent upper bounds of their

respective alternative I ranges. The Committee may wish to reaffirm

the alternative I ranges for 1996 under this rationale of providing

longer-run benchmarks, and extend them to 1997. As another rationale

for the alternative I ranges, the Committee may foresee slower growth

of M2 and M3 than the staff projects, moving these aggregates comfor-

tably within their ranges: For example, a hike in short-term interest

rates, to better ensure that inflation remains contained, such as in

the tighter scenario, would tend to depress the growth of the broader

aggregates, particularly next year given the usual lags.

(18) Alternative II raises the M2 and M3 ranges by 1 percent-

age point to align them better with the money growth likely to prevail

under the staff forecast and, judging by the central tendency of the

members' nominal GDP projections, the Committee's as well. Even if



-16-

the Committee has no intention of placing greater weight on the

aggregates, this alternative might be seen as closer to the spirit

of the Federal Reserve Act's requirement to report the "objectives

and plans" for money and credit for the current and, in July, the

following calendar year, taking account of past and prospective

developments in employment, prices, and other factors. One option

might be to center the ranges around expected monetary growth. To be

sure the alternative II ranges are not high enough to accomplish this,

but the Committee may find this feature acceptable if it intends to

pursue an opportunistic strategy in approaching its long-run objective

of price stability. In this case, monetary policy would respond

aggressively to upside surprises to nominal GDP or inflation in order

to hold the line against sustained increases in inflation, but would

be more tentative in resisting downward shocks to spending. Because

increases in short-term interest rates or shortfalls in nominal GDP

would therefore be more likely to be sizable than movements in the

opposite direction, shortfalls of money growth from the staff forecast

would tend to be larger than overshoots.



-17-

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(19) Two policy alternatives are discussed below for con-

sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would

continue to trade around 5-1/4 percent. The tighter option, alterna-

tive C, would boost the funds rate to 5-1/2 percent, through either a

1/4 percentage point hike in the discount rate or a slightly more

restrictive provision of nonborrowed reserves using open market opera-

tions.

(20) The unchanged reserves market conditions of alter-

native B are assumed in the staff economic forecast. In that fore-

cast, growth in output and employment slows in the months ahead to a

pace that is in line with the rate of increase in the economy's poten-

tial. However, because the staff sees the economy as operating in

level terms a bit beyond its potential currently and over the forecast

period, an upward drift in inflation develops. Even so, the overshoot

of output is quite small and the rise in inflation consequently mild

and gradual, suggesting that major policy adjustments would not be

necessary to keep inflation from rising. Real bond yields have in-

creased substantially in recent months and are now more in line with

levels that in the past appeared to have been consistent with holding

inflation in check. The yield curve at present embodies only small

odds of a modest policy tightening over coming months, and further

decreases in rates are likely to be quite minimal in the near term if

the Committee chose to keep policy unchanged at this meeting. In

these circumstances, even if the Committee wished to lean against the

sorts of incipient inflation pressures inherent in the staff forecast,

it might be able to afford to wait for more information to gauge

whether those pressures were likely to develop and their extent.



-18-

(21) A 1/4 percentage point increase in the federal funds

rate, as under alternative C, might be favored if the Committee wished

to impose greater restraint on spending to reduce the odds of a

gradual increase of inflation pressures. Prompt action would help to

counter the possibility of an impression developing, should data come

in on the strong side, that the Federal Reserve had become less will-

ing to act anticipatively to forestall a buildup of inflationary

pressures. A single 1/4 point tightening, however, would likely not

be adequate to contain inflation pressures if aggregate demand were

stronger than in the Greenbook or if the recent favorable behavior of

prices and costs were not to persist. Even in the staff forecast, a

single 1/4 point move probably is not sufficient to induce a downward

tilt to inflation. For example, the tighter alternative in the

Greenbook, in which policy is sufficiently restrictive to make

noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and beyond, assumes

that a quarter point tightening at this meeting would be followed by

considerable further firming later in the year.

(22) A 25 basis point rise in the federal funds rate at this

meeting as under alternative C would exceed the small amount currently

built into money market yields. As a consequence, interest rates

probably would rise across the maturity spectrum, and the exchange

rate would tend to firm. The extent of the rise in intermediate- and

longer-term interest rates would depend on whether the market saw this

as the first in a series of firming actions. Some such extrapolation

seems quite probable; market participants would reason that the new

direction for policy was unlikely to be limited to only a 1/4 percent-

age point increase, and might read the action as suggesting that the

Federal Reserve saw inflation pressures as relatively strong. The

interest rate increase might be more circumscribed if the tightening



-19-

were implemented through open market operations rather than by raising

the discount rate, and if the announcement emphasized that the Federal

Reserve itself saw the action as a limited adjustment reflecting, for

example, a view that the easing undertaken at the end of January to

gain greater assurance of satisfactory economic growth was no longer

needed. In any case, the large backup in intermediate- and long-term

yields that was associated with the initial firming in 1994 is

unlikely to be repeated: Nominal and real federal funds rates were

much lower then, and the Federal Reserve's public posture at that time

was that a substantial policy adjustment was to be expected. If the

Committee were to tighten more aggressively, by 50 basis points, real

rates would ratchet significantly higher, but the rise in nominal

longer-term rates might be limited by the perception of timely and

decisive action to counter a buildup in inflationary pressures. There

is some risk that market participants would read the action as sig-

nalling that the Federal Reserve was quite concerned that the economy

had excessive momentum and was prepared to tighten considerably fur-

ther, prompting a very substantial upward movement in interest rates,

especially in short and intermediate maturities, and in the dollar.

(23) The money and credit flows associated with a flat

federal funds rate under alternative B were discussed in the previous

sections of this document under the baseline case. In sum, the staff

would expect money and credit growth at or below their rates in the

first half, keeping M2 and M3 near the upper ends of their ranges and

debt in the middle of its range. Money growth would be expected to

slow somewhat more under alternative C, putting the broad aggregates

on paths more likely to leave them below the upper ends of their

longer-term ranges.

Directive Language

(24) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

directive wording relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1996 and

1997 and the operational paragraph for the intermeeting period.

Paragraph for 1996 and 1997 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS [DEL: its]

meeting [DEL: in January] THE RANGES IT HAD established IN JANUARY

ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6

percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of

1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. [IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE

OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT THIS MEETING RAISED/LOWERED THE

RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN JANUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3

TO RANGES OF ___ TO ___ PERCENT AND ___ TO ___PERCENT

RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1995 TO THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1996.] The monitoring range for growth of

total domestic nonfinancial debt was MAINTAINED set at 3 to 7

percent (RAISED/LOWERED TO ___ TO ___ PERCENT) for the year.

FOR 1997 THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONE-

TARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1996 TO THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1997, OF ___ TO ___ PERCENT FOR M2 AND

TO __ PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE

ASSOCIATED MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF TOTAL DOMESTIC

NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ___ TO ___ PERCENT FOR 1997. The be-

havior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evalu-

ated in the light of progress toward price level stability,



-21-

movements in their velocities, and developments in the

economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objec-

tives for price stability and sustainable economic growth,

and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and

monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve

restraint WOULD/MIGHT or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint would/MIGHT be acceptable in the intermeeting

period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.

n.s. -- not specified.
Footnotes on following page



1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was
5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited
effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more
actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased
M1-A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting,
the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the
adjusted ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted)
was 5.0 percent

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the
fourth quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered
to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for
M3, and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2,
0 to 4 percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised to 2 to 6
percent at the July 1995 meeting.

14. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1995 QIV to June 1996 and for nonfinancial
debt are from 1995 QIV to May 1996.
