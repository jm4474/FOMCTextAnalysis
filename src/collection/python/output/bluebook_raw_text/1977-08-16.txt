Recent developments

(1) M-1 surged to an 18.3 per cent annual rate of expansion

in July, with only a minor part of this increase apparently attributable

to special factors such as early disbursements of social security checks

and the New York blackout. More recently, growth in M-1 has slowed

considerably, but for the July-August period is still estimated at an

11.7 per cent annual rate, roughly 4 percentage points above the upper

end of the Committee's range. Mainly reflecting the strength of M-1,

growth in M-2 over July and August is now estimated at an 11.7 per cent

annual rate, about 1 percentage point above the upper end of its range.

Savings account balances increased at a moderate rate in July after

having declined somewhat in June, while growth in the time deposit

component of M-2 was maintained in July at the strong June pace.

Deposit flows into thrift institutions have also been quite strong

in recent weeks. Reflecting the rapid growth in demand and time deposits,

nonborrowed reserves are expected to expand at about a 9.2 per cent

annual rate over July and August.

(2) In the last week of July, as incoming data provided

confirmation of the unexpectedly strong expansion in the monetary

aggregates, the Account Management began raising its Federal funds

rate objective from the prevailing level of around 5-3/8 per cent. By

the end of the August 3 statement week, the Desk was aiming at a Federal

funds rate of 5¾ per cent, the upper limit of the intermeeting range

specified in the Committee's directive. On August 4, Chairman Burns

recommended raising the upper limit of the range for the funds rate to

6 per cent, in order to provide the Desk with some additional leeway for

operations, while continuing to take into account the current Treasury

financing and financial market developments. He further recommended

that the additional leewaybe used very gradually, and only in the event

that the aggregates continued to register values far beyond the Committee's

objectives. This recommendation was approved by the Committee. The

Account Management continued to aim for a funds rate of around 5¾ per cent

until late in the August 10 statement week, but more recently raised the

funds rate objective to 6 per cent, since incoming data continued to

indicate strong growth of the aggregates.

(3) Commercial bank credit expanded at an annual rate of about

9¼ per cent in July. With deposit expansion rapid during the month,

banks were able to finance loans and investments while letting out-

standing negotiable CD's and nondeposit sources of funds contract.

Total loans of banks increased substantially, paced by strong

gains in real estate and consumer installment loans. Business

loans also posted a further advance during the month, but the



increase was significantly below the average monthly gain of the second

quarter.

(4) Aggregate credit demands have remained relatively strong

in recent weeks. Households have apparently continued to raise a sub-

stantial volume of funds in the mortgage and consumer credit markets,

and the U.S. Treasury has once again been raising sizable amounts of new

money, following its second-quarter paydown of debt. Partly offsetting

these areas of strength, issuance of long-term bonds by State and local

governments has declined more than seasonally from the record June pace.

In addition, total business credit demands have moderated, as the slowing

in growth of business loans at banks in July was accompanied by a sizable

reduction in the commercial paper indebtedness of nonfinancial corpora-

tions. Also, while issuance of publicly-offered corporate bonds picked

up a bit in July, the volume coming to market in August has declined

seasonally.

(5) In response to the tightening of the Federal fund rate

and the strengthening in the monetary aggregates, short-term interest

rates have increased since the July FOMC meeting by around 15 to 45 basis

points. Increases in yields on long-term bonds have been decidedly more

moderate, with rates on Treasury bonds increasing by around 10 basis

points, while yields on corporate and municipal securities have changed

little.

(6) Since the July meeting, the U.S. Treasury has raised

about $1 billion in domestic credit markets through a sale of 2-year

notes and another $3 billion in conjunction with its mid-August



refunding.1/ In the refunding the Treasury auctioned $3.0 billion of a

3-year note at an average yield of 6.84 per cent, $2.25 billion of a

7-year note at an average yield of 7.26 per cent, and $1.0 billion of a

reopened 29 -year bond at an average yield of 7.72 per cent. Dealers

have distributed essentially all of the $2.7 billion of issues they were

awarded in the auctions, however, and now have deep net short positions

in coupon issues with less than 10 years to mature and very modest long

positions in issues with over 10 years maturities.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in terms of

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

over various time periods.

1/ In addition, the Treasury obtained $1½ billion of new cash through
add-on sales of these issues to foreigners.

Prospective developments

(8) Shown below for Committee consideration are alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate

covering the period between now and the next Committee meeting. (More

detailed data on the aggregates for a longer time span are shown in the

tables on pp. 7 and 8).

M-2 5-9 4½-8½ 4-8

Federal funds rate 5¼-5¾ 5¾-6¼ 6¼-6¾
(intermeeting period)

(9) A marked slowing in growth of M-1 is anticipated for

the August-September period, as the extremely rapid expansion in M-1

in July probably provided the public with enough cash to accommodate

the bulk of third-quarter transactions needs. Under alternative B,

M-1 is expected to expand in a 2-6 per cent, annual rate, range. Such

an expansion would produce an 8¾ per cent annual rate of growth from the

second to the third quarter, as compared with a 12 per cent annual rate

of growth in nominal GNP projected for that period.

(10) Growth in M-2 over the August-September period under

alternative B is expected to be in a 4 -8 per cent annual rate range.

The time and savings deposit component of M-2 is likely to expand at

about an 8¼ per cent annual rate over the period, well below the June-

July average. The higher level of interest rates on short- and

intermediate-term market instruments that has recently emerged is

expected to divert funds away from savings and shorter-maturity time

deposits.

(11) As of this writing, credit markets probably have not

fully adjusted to a 6 per cent Federal funds rate, the current Desk

objective. Thus, some further rise in interest rates, particularly

short rates, could develop over the next week or so. Assuming the funds

rate remains around 6 per cent over the whole intermeeting period, and

with the Treasury bill supply expected to be relatively limited over the

near-term, the 3-month bill rate may be in the neighborhood of 5-5/8

per cent. The Treasury is not expected to raise new cash through bill

offerings until the fourth quarter.

(12) Longer-term markets are in a strong technical position.

Dealers have a net short position in Treasury coupon issues maturing

in more than a year of around $1 billion. And a reduced volume of

corporate and municipal bonds is expected to be marketed over the balance

of the current quarter, though the volume of municipal securities will

probably still be substantial. Thus, relatively little upward adjust-

ment in long-term rates may be expected over the next few weeks, assuming

a 6 per cent Federal funds rate.

(13) The staff expects that the Federal funds rate would have

to rise above 6 per cent over the next few months, however, if growth

in M-1 were to be held to the mid-point of the 4 to 6½ per cent longer-run

range (pertaining to the QII '77-QII '78 period) adopted by the Committee



-10-

at its July meeting. A substantial cut-back in M-1 growth to about a

4 per cent annual rate over the next three quarters would be required.

The necessary curtailment in the supply of reserves would probably

lead to a Federal funds rate of around 6-7/8 per cent by early next year.

This is a higher rate than estimated at the time of the last meeting,

and takes account of the apparent strengthening of money demand relative

to GNP that has developed in the spring and early summer.

(14) As market interest rates rise, inflows of time and

savings deposits, other than large CD's, would probably slow down,

assuming no adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates. With bank credit

demands expected to remain generally strong through mid-1978--given

the staff's GNP forecast--banks are likely to bid actively for CD's

and nondeposit funds. Thrift institutions, too, would probably begin

to rely more heavily on borrowed funds, or sales of liquid assets, to

meet commitments. These financial adjustments, as they develop, may

entail a 3-month bill rate in the 7 per cent area in the first half

of 1978, a commercial paper rate in the order of 7¼ per cent, and minor

upward adjustments in long-term rates, including a rise in the high-

grade corporate bond rate to around 8 per cent and primary mortgage

market rates to a little over 9 per cent.

(15) Alternative C involves a rise in the Federal funds

rate to the mid-point of a 6¼-6¾ per cent range between now and the

next Committee meeting. Such an approach would add to restraint on

money growth in the weeks ahead--with M-1 expected to expand in a



-11-

1½-5½ per cent annual rate range over the August-September period. And

only a very minor further rise in the funds rate might be required in

achieving the Committee's current longer-run ranges for the monetary

aggregates.

(16) The further rise in the funds rate of ½ percentage point

over the next few weeks contemplated under alternative C would likely

lead to increases of comparable magnitude in short-term rates generally.

Upward rate pressures would probably also be communicated to the inter-

mediate-term market, where the Treasury is expected to raise $2-$3 billion

of new cash through routine offerings of 2- and 4-year notes during the

next few weeks, though they may be moderate in view of the market's strong

technical position. Longer-term rates, too, might increase somewhat, but

any such increases might not be long sustained if the market came to

believe that the process of tightening was near an end or that the

process would work to restrain inflation.

(17) The easing in the money market envisioned under alternative

A may stimulate rather substantial downward adjustments over the short-run

in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates, particularly in the

Treasury securities market where dealers may be expected to make efforts

to cover short positions. The staff would not expect that downward rate

movements could be sustained, however. Given the projected strength in

nominal GNP and money demand between now and mid-1978, interest rates would

probably once again begin rising by early fall--with the funds rate under

this alternative peaking at around 7¼ per cent in the second quarter of

1978.



-12-

Directive language

(18) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs

of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive adopted at

the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of growth in

monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications

adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation places main emphasis

on money market conditions. As suggested below, the particular language

needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend

on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling,

respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money

market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications

discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in

M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth

rates over the [DEL: July-August] AUGUST-SEPTEMBER period to be within the

ranges of [DEL: 3-l/2 to 7-1/2] ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and

[6-1/2-to-10-1/2] ____ to ____ per cent for M-2. In the judg-

ment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated

with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about [DEL: 5-3/8] ____

per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2,



-13-

it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate

significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the

operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified

in an orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 5-1/4 to 6] ____ to

____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be sig-

nificantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevail-

ing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier or some-

what firmer money market conditions) during the period immediately

ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at

approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be

on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for mone-

tary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the

Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate

at about ____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be grow-

ing over the August-September period at annual rates within ranges of

____ to ____ per cent and ____ to ____ per cent, respectively.

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that

growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond



-14-

the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for

the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an

orderly fashion within a range of ____to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be sig-

nificantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

On average thus far in the third quarter, nonborrowed

at a 10.2 per cent rate, and the monetary base at a 9.6 per cent rate.

These rates are well above the growth rates for the second half of 1977

shown in the table above that are thought to be consistent with the

alternatives presented to the Committee. Thus, a considerable

slowing in growth of reserves will be needed over the months ahead.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed
by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting
syndicate positions consist of issues .till in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less bor-
rowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and
municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data
are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average
of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.
Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-
term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate
delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
