The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 expanded at about a 5 per cent annual rate in

March. However, growth accelerated sharply in the early weeks of

April, partly, it seems, as a result of earlier-than-usual disburse-

ment of the regular monthly social security payments. For the March-

April period, M1 is now projected to increase at about a 9¼ per cent

annual rate--above the 8 per cent upper limit of the Committee's desired

range. M2 grew at somewhat more than an 8 per cent annual rate in

March. While its growth also accelerated in early April, this was due

entirely to the more rapid expansion of M1; the March-April growth for

M2 still appears to be well below the upper limit of the Committee's

range. Nonborrowed reserves fell in March. With the recent pick-up in

deposit growth at member banks, however, they are expected to grow

rapidly in April.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the quarterly benchmark revisions
of monetary aggregates that will be published on April 21. The
benchmark revisions (based on the September call report) are
relatively small. The level of M for recent months revised up no
more than $700 million. The monthly levels of M2 were adjusted by
even smaller amounts. All tables on subsequent pages of this report
(with the exception of Tables 1 and 2, following the charts) are
based on the new series. The new and old series are compared in
Appendix V.

(2) Over most of the intermeeting period, incoming data

suggested that March-April growth rates for M and M2 would be well

within their respective ranges. The Desk, therefore, continued to aim

for a Federal funds rate in the area of 4-5/8--4¾ per cent. Most recently,

with growth in M1 exceeding its two-month range, the Desk has sought

a funds rate around 4¾ per cent.

(3) Credit demands have remained sizable in recent weeks.

Business short-term borrowing appears to have slackened from the high

rate of January-February, but public offerings of long-term corporate

bonds have picked up a little. State and local governments security



issues have remained very large. The Federal Government borrowed

$3.6 billion of new cash through issues of 2- and 5-year notes since

the March FOMC meeting. In addition the Treasury sold $4.5 billion of

short-dated cash management bills to bridge a low point in its cash

balance prior to the April tax date.

(4) Market interest rates showed little change over most of the

intermeeting period. But when the President's intention to withdraw the

rebate program became known, interest rates fell sharply. The subsequent

publication of data indicating a record weekly growth of M1 in early April

had very little offsetting market impact. On balance, over the inter-

meeting period, most short-term rates have declined 5 to 15 basis points,

bond yields are down 10 to 20 basis points, and intermediate-term

Treasury coupon yields are off as much as 35 basis points.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in terms of

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

Prospective developments

(6) Alternative longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates

are shown below for Committee consideration. Alternatives A through C

are the staff's estimates of consistent sets of specifications that pertain

to the one-year QI '77-QI '78 period. The ranges earlier adopted by the

Committee for the QIV '76-QIV '77 period are shown in the fourth column.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current

M1 5½-7½ 4½-6½ 3½-5½ 4½-6½

M2  8-11 6½-9½ 5½-8½ 7-10

M 3  9-12 7½-10½ 6-9 8½-11½

Bank credit proxy 8½-11½ 7½-10½ 7-10 7-10

(7) Alternative B encompasses a one-year growth rate for M1

of 4½-6½ per cent, the same range as is currently in place. However,

growth ranges for M2 and M3 under this alternative are lower--by ½ percen-

tage point for M2 and 1 percentage point for M3 . Lower ranges for the

broader aggregates relative to M1 are expected mainly because the new

ranges now apply to a period that excludes QIV '76, when relatively low

market rates produced large inflows of time and savings deposits at

depository institutions, and instead includes QI '78, when relatively

high market interest rates are expected to dampen such flows.1/

(8) Shorter-run ranges for the monetary aggregates and

the Federal funds rate that are thought to be consistent with the

1/ Appendix I compares terminal levels of M1 and M2 under the proposed
alternatives with levels implicit in the current ranges.

various longer-run ranges are presented below. (Detailed data are

shown in the tables on pp. 7 and 8).

M2  8½-12½ 8-12 7½-11½

Federal funds rate 3¾-4¾ 4¼-5¼ 4¾-5¾
(intermeeting period)

(9) Under alternative B (as well as the other two alternatives),

growth in M1 is expected to be relatively sizable in the April-May period,

reflecting the large increase in M1 that is apparently under way in April.

We expect the exceptionally large April growth to be partly offset by

relatively small growth rates in May and June. However, for the second

quarter, M1 is anticipated to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate, a

more rapid pace than in the past few quarters, reflecting the recent

strengthening of economic activity and presumably also of transactions

demands for money.

(10) M2 growth under alternative B is expected to be in an

8-12 per cent annual rate range during the April-May period, and to

expand at about a 9¼ per cent annual rate from the first to second

quarter. Time and savings deposits other than large CD's are expected

to expand over the next few weeks at close to their recent pace, given

a Federal funds rate around the mid-point of a 4¼-5¼ per cent range.

(11) Over the next few weeks, demands on credit markets are

likely to be quite moderate. Without the rebate program, Treasury

borrowing in the second quarter will be reduced by about $8 ½ billion.

As a result, the Treasury probably will raise no, or very little, new

cash in the market between now and mid-year. The Treasury will announce

terms of its mid-May refunding on April 27, and this may well be a routine

package of intermediate- and longer-term coupon issues to replace $4.3

billion of publicly held maturing obligations. Corporate bond offerings

during the spring are expected to run below the monthly average pace of

the first quarter, according to market reports, but offerings of municipal

bonds are expected to remain sizable.

(12) After mid-year, Treasury demands on credit markets will

strengthen considerably. Total private credit demands are also expected

to expand along with continued relatively rapid growth in economic activity.

With demands for money also anticipated to be rather substantial, interest

rates, particularly short-term rates, are likely to rise substantially

in the second half of the year if growth in the monetary aggregates is

to be maintained around the mid-points of the longer-run ranges shown

for alternative B. As shown in appendix III, the staff expects the funds

rate under alternative B to average around 4-7/8 per cent in the current

quarter, to rise to 5½ per cent in the third, and to reach about 6½

per cent by the first quarter of 1978.

(13) These interest rate projections are a little lower than

shown in recent blue books for a longer-run M1 growth rate in a 4½-6½ per

cent range. In part this reflects reduced Treasury credit demands. But



-10-

it also takes account of the possibility that the demand for money

may be somewhat less relative to GNP than we earlier thought--as might

be suggested by the acceleration in the income velocity of M1 that occurred

during the first quarter of this year without any accompanying rise in

short-term rates. Velocity figures for all three alternatives are shown

in appendix IV.

(14) The projected rise in market interest rates will lead

to slower inflows of time and savings deposits other than large CD's to

banks and thrift institutions as the year progresses even though institu-

tions that had earlier reduced offering rates on such deposits are likely

to re-establish ceiling rates. With loan demands at banks expected to

be at least as strong as in the past few months, banks can be expected

both to cut down on acquisitions of Treasury securities and also to

expand their outstanding volume of CD's. Thrift institutions are also

likely to reduce their liquidity over the year--with savings and loan

associations increasing their borrowing from the Home Loan Bank System--

in order to accommodate outstanding commitments and to become more

cautious in making new commitments. As a result the mortgage market would

come under increasing pressure. The extent of upward rate pressure in

long-term markets in general under this alternative may be fairly moderate,

though, given the large cash flow to institutional investors, particularly

insurance companies, and assuming inflationary expectations do not worsen.

(15) Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market

conditions between now and the next Committee meeting, with the funds



-11-

rate dropping to the mid-point of a 3¾-4¾ per cent range. Such a move

would be accompanied by somewhat greater growth in the monetary

aggregates than under alternative B over the April-May period. In

particular, there may be substantial inflows into savings deposits as

short-term market rates drop significantly further below ceiling rates

on such deposits. This would, of course, increase pressure on institutions

to shave their offering rates.

(16) The lower interest rates associated with this alternative

over the next few weeks are not likely to prove sustainable, however. In

view of the apparent strength of the economy, interest rates may be

expected to rise even with the more rapid longer-run growth in the

monetary aggregates encompassed by alternative A. The increase in rates

would probably be moderate, though, with the funds rate rising to about

5 per cent by the first quarter of next year.

(17) Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal funds

rate between now and the next Committee meeting to around 5¼ per cent,

the mid-point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent range. Such a funds rate increase at

this time may be accompanied by a rise in bill rates of roughly the same

magnitude over the next few weeks. The extent of adjustment in bill,

as well as longer-term, rates will depend in large part on the market's

assessment of the interest rate outlook and on the market's technical

condition. At present, dealer positions are relatively low, particularly

in the coupon area, and this would tend to moderate upward interest

rate adjustments. On the other hand, if many market participants

do not expect the Fed to let the money market tighten at this time,

evidence of a tightening could cause a more substantial market reaction.



-12-

(18) The immediate tightening of the money market contemplated

under alternative C would also more quickly set in train the market and

institutional responses described in paragraph (14). Inflows of time

and savings deposits would begin to slow in the weeks ahead as the bill

rate moved close to and perhaps above the passbook ceiling rate. Large

commercial banks could be expected to become more aggressive in the market

for CD's and nondeposit sources of funds. And thrift institutions would

begin re-evaluating their mortgage market participation.

(19) If the growth in M1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period is

to be constrained to around the mid-point of the 3½-5½ per cent longer-

run range of alternative C, further firming in money market conditions

would probably be required as the year progresses. Pressures on financial

institutions would, of course, intensify. The staff expects that the

Federal funds rate would have to rise to about 6¼ per cent in the third

quarter and 7¼ per cent by early 1978.

Directive language

(20) Given below are alternatives for the operational para-

graphs of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive

adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of

growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the

specifications adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation

places main emphasis on money market conditions. As suggested below,

the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market

formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three

alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevail-

ing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be

associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section

under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the

annual growth rates over the [DEL: March-April] APRIL-MAY period to be

within the ranges of [DEL: 4-
1/2 to 8-1/2] ____ to ____ per cent

for M-1 and [DEL: 7 to 11] _____ to ____ per cent for M-2. In the

judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be

associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of

about [DEL: 4-5/8 to 4-3/4] ____ per cent. If giving,



-14-

approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth

rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the

midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for

the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion

within a range of [DEL: 4-1/4 to 5-1/4] ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat

easier or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the

period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates

appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently

expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably con-

sistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited

in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks

to maintain the weekly average Federal funds rate at about

____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing

over the APRIL-MAY period at annual rates within ranges of

____ to ____ per cent and ____ to ____ per cent,



-15-

respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and

M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are

approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges,

the operational objective for the weekly average Federal funds

rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of

____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

in the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 implied

by the alternatives presented in the present blue book (which take

QI '77 as the base).

Of the three alternatives presented, alternative B is closest

to the current longer-run path. By the first quarter of 1978, the levels

of M1 and M2 under B are only two-tenths of 1 per cent different from

those implied by the current path. Terminal levels under alternatives

A and C are about 3/4 of a per cent to 1¼ per cent different from

those implied by the current path.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist

of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures,

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average of
contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.
Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-
term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate
delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
