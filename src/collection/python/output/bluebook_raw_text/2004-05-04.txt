1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1 percent over the intermeeting
period.  The Desk expanded the System’s outright holdings of securities by
$4.5 billion, with purchases from foreign official customers of $1.1 billion of Treasury
bills and market purchases of $2.6 billion of Treasury bills and $0.8 billion of coupon
securities.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased $1 billion to 
$16 billion.

Class I – FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1)  The FOMC’s decision at its March meeting to leave the intended level

of the federal funds rate unchanged had been fully anticipated in markets, but the

assessment of the economy in the accompanying statement was read as having a soft

cast, and interest rates moved lower.1  In the weeks that followed, however, interest

rates rose sharply in response to the much-stronger-than-expected employment report

for March and to other data releases pointing to firming household and business

spending and rising prices, as well as to the Chairman’s statement in congressional

testimony that “the threat of deflation is no longer an issue.”  Futures markets and

dealer surveys suggest virtually no expectation of a rate move at the May meeting. 

With regard to the associated statement, dealers apparently anticipate that the

Committee will modify or drop the reference to “patience” and characterize the risks

to the achievement of sustainable growth and to price stability as balanced.  Market

participants now appear to believe that tightening will commence in the third quarter,

rather than late in the year as previously thought, and will bring the federal funds rate

to nearly 3½ percent by the end of 2005, a full percentage point higher than

anticipated at the time of the March meeting (Chart 1). 

(2) This shift over the intermeeting period toward the expectation of

prompter and more substantial monetary policy tightening precipitated increases of

over 70 basis points in nominal Treasury yields at maturities between two and ten

2 The rise in longer-term yields over the intermeeting period may have been
amplified by efforts to hedge the lengthening duration of mortgage portfolios, which
increased about one year on average as interest rates moved higher and the risk of
prepayment fell.  Nevertheless, with market participants reportedly prepared for
increases in interest rates, trading in Treasuries remained orderly.

years.2  Rates on inflation-indexed securities rose somewhat less, leaving inflation

compensation modestly higher (as discussed in the box entitled “Inflation

Expectations and CPI Futures”).  Despite the backup in real interest rates, equity

indexes edged higher over the intermeeting period, supported importantly by earnings

reports that generally outstripped market expectations.  Investment-grade private

yields moved up in line with Treasuries, but those on lower-rated instruments posted

smaller increases, leading to a further narrowing of high-yield risk spreads (Chart 2). 

Investment-grade yields are now about a percentage point higher than at the time of

last June’s policy easing, while those on high-yield instruments are around a

percentage point lower.

(3) The dollar appreciated about 1¾ percent on balance against other major

currencies during the intermeeting period, principally in response to further

indications of strength in the U.S. economy and the associated increases in interest

rates (Chart 3).  The dollar gained 2½ percent versus the euro as convincing signs of a

quickening in economic activity in the euro area failed to emerge.  The ECB held

policy steady.  The Bank of Canada responded to continued sluggish economic

performance with another 25-basis-point cut in its policy rates in mid-April–the third

such action this year–and the dollar ended the period about 2¾ percent higher against

the Canadian dollar.  The dollar recorded an unusually wide swing against the yen,

dropping more than 6 percent over the second half of March before reversing most of

that loss.  In addition to the effects of U.S. data surprises, the turnaround may have

reflected Japanese investors taking new dollar positions following the end of their

fiscal year on March 31.  In a distinct break from their previous policy, Japanese

Inflation Expectations and CPI Futures

Inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between yields on nominal
and indexed Treasury securities, edged up over the intermeeting period for both the
next five years and the subsequent five years.  Inflation compensation over the next
five years has been on an uptrend since last summer, likely reflecting strengthening
economic activity, rising energy and commodity prices, and recent data showing
higher-than-expected realized inflation.  By contrast, the forward inflation
compensation measure has changed little, on net, over that period.   

For a more complete view of investors’ outlook, inflation compensation can be
computed for all outstanding ten-year indexed notes, which have remaining
maturities spanning 2007 to 2014 (chart).  At shorter maturities, this information
can now be supplemented with readings from CPI futures contracts.  CPI futures
were recently introduced by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and cover maturities
shorter than those of Treasury indexed debt.  While CPI futures remain illiquid, the
two measures of inflation compensation match up fairly well–although not
perfectly–where they meet near the end of 2006.  Inflation compensation increases
appreciably over the next two years and moves up more gradually thereafter,
reaching around 2½ percent at the ten-year maturity.  Although some portion of
the upward slope to inflation compensation may owe to inflation risk premiums, it
seems likely that inflation is also expected to rise over the next few years.

3  The Japanese authorities last intervened on March 16th, the day of the FOMC
meeting, when they purchased $615 million.   

        .  The Desk did not
intervene during the latest period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

authorities refrained from intervening in foreign exchange markets after mid-March.3 

Yields on longer-term government bonds in major industrial countries rose 25 to 50

basis points over the intermeeting period, considerably less than in the United States. 

Stock markets in most major foreign economies continued to make solid gains, with

the 7 percent average increase in Japanese stocks leading the pack. 

(4) The dollar rose about 1 percent during the intermeeting period against

an index of currencies of other important trading partners.  The dollar moved up

more than 3½ percent on balance versus the peso on evidence that economic activity

in Mexico was weaker than expected.  The Mexican central bank surprised market

participants by tightening policy, in part to bring inflation down to within the official

target range.  Mexico’s EMBI+ spread was about unchanged over the intermeeting

period, but Brazil’s spread widened 100 basis points, to over 6½ percentage points. 

The People’s Bank of China raised reserve requirements and tightened restrictions on

lending in late April in an effort to prevent overheating of the Chinese economy.

(5) The expansion of domestic nonfinancial sector debt remained brisk in

the first quarter, supported by a pickup in federal issuance and strong household

borrowing (Chart 4).  A further jump in the federal budget deficit resulted in record

sales of marketable Treasury debt in the first quarter.  Residential mortgage debt

growth continues to be rapid, albeit somewhat off the record rates of the last two

years, as the recent drop-off in refinancing applications has yet to show through

materially to originations.  Financing conditions for businesses have continued to

improve, with banks further easing standards and terms between January and April as

reported in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Although business

credit demands have strengthened a bit this year along with a faster pace of capital

expenditures, borrowing needs have been held down by robust corporate profits. 

Bond issuance by investment-grade firms rose in the first quarter as interest rates fell

but seems to have weakened a bit in April with the backup in rates.  Lower-tier bond

issuance has remained robust, reflecting in part the narrowing of spreads on such

instruments.  Short-term business debt contracted again in the first quarter, but at a

slower pace than last year, and has edged up in recent weeks.

(6) M2 growth was quite strong in March and April, boosted in part by the

temporary effects of elevated refinancing activity in the first quarter.  Currency

growth, by contrast, has been held down by weak demand from abroad.  In addition

to ongoing substitution of euros for dollars in Europe and elsewhere, foreign demand

for U.S. currency has been damped by relative stability in countries that had been

significant sources of demand.

4  All references to output, employment, and inflation measures in this
document, as well as the money and debt projections, are based on the data available
and the staff forecast when the April Greenbook was published yesterday.  The BEA’s
advance estimate of first quarter GDP, which was released this morning, shows GDP
growth of 4.2 percent in the first quarter–a percentage point below the staff
projection.  The bulk of the difference reflected lower inventory investment than the
staff had anticipated.

Policy Alternatives4

(7) Incoming data on spending and employment over the intermeeting

period led the staff to mark up its estimate of first-quarter growth but not to change

materially the contours of the forecast of output thereafter.  The past few readings on

inflation also ran faster than expected, reflecting in part the effects of higher energy

and non-oil import prices and outsized increases in a few volatile components.  The

staff saw some signal in these releases and revised up its projection of core consumer

price inflation about ¼ percentage point this year and next.  In light of these

developments, the staff now assumes that the Committee will start tightening in the

fall, a quarter earlier than in the March Greenbook, and firm gradually thereafter. 

Longer-term interest rates move sideways over the forecast period, with the upward

push of tighter policy about offsetting the downward pull of revisions to expected

future short-term rates as investors realize that inflation is likely to remain lower and

policy to tighten by less than currently expected.  Equity prices and the foreign

exchange value of the dollar have both been marked up to reflect their current,

higher-than-anticipated levels.  Equity prices are again assumed to rise to yield

risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income instruments and the dollar to

edge lower at a rate similar to that assumed in the March Greenbook.  With

accommodative monetary and fiscal policy supporting growth, real GDP is projected

to expand at about a 5 percent rate over the final three quarters of 2004.  However,

monetary policy tightening and a swing in fiscal policy toward restraint contribute to a

moderation of GDP growth to about 3¾ percent in 2005–a touch above the

estimated growth rate of potential output.  The unemployment rate is expected to end

the forecast period at 5¼ percent, still somewhat above the staff’s estimate of the



7

natural rate, as productivity growth continues to be robust and labor force

participation picks up.  With oil prices moderating, commodity prices stabilizing,

longer-term inflation expectations apparently remaining well-anchored, and a portion

of the gap between output and its potential persisting until the end of the forecast

period, core PCE inflation is projected to edge lower to about 1¼ percent later this

year and remain near that level through next year. 

(8) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Alternatives A and B

assume that the federal funds rate holds at 1 percent but differ as to the Committee’s

characterization of the strength of the economy and its willingness to be patient in

removing policy accommodation.  Alternative C contemplates a quarter-point firming

and aligns the wording of the statement accordingly.  Under any of these alternatives,

several changes seem necessary to update the characterization of economic

conditions.  In particular, with employment growth averaging 170,000 per month over

the first three months of the year, the rationale paragraph could indicate that “hiring

appears to have picked up.”  And the unexpectedly high inflation figures could be

acknowledged by stating that “incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher.”

Assuming that the Committee now sees the odds of a significant further decline in

inflation as remote, the assessment-of-risks paragraph should indicate that “the upside

and downside risks to the goal of price stability are seen as roughly equal.”

(9) In light of the data released over the intermeeting period, the Committee

may feel more confident that vigorous output growth will be sustained and that slack

in labor markets will diminish.  Moreover, the higher-than-anticipated price data might

be taken as evidence that inflation has bottomed.  In these circumstances, the

Committee might want to adopt language that would provide more flexibility about

future action so that it has scope to begin unwinding its current policy

accommodation if circumstances soon warrant, as in Alternative B.  Even if such

action were not viewed as imminent, the Committee might favor a change in the

wording if members put some weight on the possibility of tightening in the next few

months as more information bearing on the strength of the labor market and inflation

trends becomes available.  Deferring policy firming, at least for a time, may not be

seen as especially costly:  Even if somewhat stronger employment growth and a

slowing in the rate of advance of productivity pushed up labor costs, competitive

pressure may lead firms to trim currently high profit margins, limiting the pass-

through of rising costs to inflation.  And, while inflation compensation five to ten

years out implied by TIIS yields moved up some over the intermeeting period, it has

changed little, on net, since last fall, suggesting that longer-term expectations remain

well-anchored.  

(10) The Committee has multiple opportunities in its statement to indicate

that the odds of policy firming in the near future are higher than at the March

meeting, as shown in the column labeled Alternative B in Table 1.  At the same time,

it might also offer a reason in the rationale paragraph why it does not see the need to

tighten immediately by noting that “longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained

well-anchored.”  With the risks to the outlook balanced and the economy potentially

picking up steam as the gloom that weighed on business investment and hiring

disperses, Committee members may feel that it is now appropriate to drop the

sentence referring to patience in removing policy accommodation.  Such a change

may be seen as particularly desirable if the Committee believes that investors’

confidence that interest rates will remain low has been encouraging the development

of financial market imbalances that could have adverse macroeconomic effects as they

unwind.  However, members may be concerned that eliminating any characterization

of the Committee’s future action might lead market participants to build in outsized

expectations about the speed with which policy accommodation will be removed,

thereby augmenting the considerable tightening in financial conditions of the past few

weeks.  The Committee could convey the sense that its current outlook was consistent

with a gradual return to a neutral policy stance by providing assurance at the end of

the assessment of risks paragraph that, “At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use

slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace.” 

Even with the inclusion of such a sentence, however, a statement along these lines

would likely lead market participants to bring a bit closer in time the expected date of



9

the commencement of monetary policy tightening.  In response, interest rates would

rise, stock prices likely would decline, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar

would tend to appreciate.     

(11) If Committee members were sufficiently confident that the expansion

was now self-sustaining or saw the recent increase in core inflation as signaling an

upturn in underlying inflation, then they might find an increase of ¼ percentage point

in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in Alternative C, to be appropriate.  The

Committee may view the advances in investment outlays, coupled with the more

recent evidence that hiring is picking up, as suggesting that the tentativeness that had

earlier marked business behavior has lifted.  Indeed, as increased hiring buoys incomes

and consumer confidence, the resulting growth in spending may support faster gains

in investment spending and employment than expected by the staff, implying a swifter

erosion of resource slack.  Members may also be less confident than the staff that

aggregate supply will continue to expand at a rapid pace and that the recent increases

in energy and non-oil import prices will leave only a small imprint on inflation

expectations.  If so, the Committee, like financial market participants, may see a

significant risk that inflation could move higher, suggesting that the time has come to

adjust policy.  Indeed, if the Committee believes that expected inflation may rise, then

it might see an increase in the target funds rate as necessary just to avoid a reduction

in the real federal funds rate and a consequent easing of policy relative to measures of

the equilibrium funds rate (Chart 5).  The argument for tighter policy would be

strengthened to the extent that the Committee wants to keep inflation near its recent

lows over the longer term, rather than allowing some increase.  While policy

tightening might put some strains on financial markets for a time, Committee

members might not be convinced that the elevated uncertainty and financial market

turbulence of 1994-95 is as relevant a precedent as some observers assert, in part

because investors seem to expect that significant tightening will commence soon (see

box on “Lessons From the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle”).

Lessons from the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle

The current policy environment is similar in some respects to that prevailing before the
policy tightening in 1994-95.  In both cases, an initially sluggish expansion in
employment was accompanied by a real federal funds rate that fell to near zero for a
time.  The nominal federal funds rate target, shown in the left panel on the next page, is
currently 2 percentage points lower than at the start of 1994, reflecting in part the net
decline in inflation over the intervening ten years.  The policy tightening that began in
February 1994 sparked a period of financial market turbulence that caused serious
difficulties for some financial institutions.  This adverse outcome has raised concerns
about whether similar volatility could follow a move to tighter policy this year.

The seemingly outsized market reaction to the 1994-95 tightening reflected several
factors.  First, many market participants had not fully expected a policy tightening at that
time and so were poorly positioned.  Second, investors considerably underestimated the
ultimate extent of tightening, though part of that forecast error reflected the surprising
strength of the economy after the tightening process had begun.  (The staff was
surprised as well, and the Greenbook forecast of the unemployment rate in the fourth
quarter of 1994 fell about ¾ percentage point over the course of that year.)  Third,
uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was high, particularly
early in the tightening cycle.  Investors reacted to the changed economic and policy
outlook by selling long-term securities to limit capital losses and hedge the lengthening
durations of mortgage portfolios that resulted from higher interest rates.  These portfolio
adjustments at times took place over short periods of time, leading to volatile moves in
long-term rates.  As shown in the right panel, long-term yields increased almost as much
as short-term rates early in the tightening cycle. 

To be sure, the historical record does suggest that changes in the direction of the policy
rate tend to elicit a stronger market response than actions extending the existing trend in
the policy rate.  And the turbulence in financial markets last summer and fall may suggest
that hedging flows will magnify the amplitude of any swings in longer-term interest rates. 
As a result, some firms with large interest rate exposures could face substantial losses
when interest rates rise.  That said, there are some signs that financial firms and markets
may be able to handle policy tightening better than they did in 1994.  Although the
expected policy path is not as steep now as the actual tightening that took place ten years
ago, it is nonetheless considerably steeper than that foreseen immediately before the first
tightening in 1994.  Even if interest rates do respond strongly to a move toward tighter
policy, financial institutions appear better positioned to withstand the impact owing to
improved risk-management practices.  And, although the size of the mortgage market is
now much larger, the recent run-up in interest rates has reduced prepayment rates
enough to moderate the extent to which any further increase in rates will induce hedging
flows.

Lessons from the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle (Continued)

(12) If the Committee chooses to tighten policy at this meeting, then it might

well be inclined to issue a statement like that shown in the last column of Table 1. 

This statement starts by noting the change in policy: “The Federal Open Market

Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate to 1¼ percent.”  To avoid

repetition later, the first sentence of the rationale paragraph might refer only to

productivity growth–“Robust underlying growth in productivity is providing important ongoing

support to economic activity.”  The explanation for the policy move could follow at the end

of the paragraph: “Against this backdrop, the Committee felt that some reduction in the degree of

monetary accommodation was desirable to promote price stability and thus help sustain the economic

expansion.”  So long as the Committee believed that the policy move, and the expected

reaction to that move in financial markets, was likely to be sufficient to contain upside

risks for the time being, then it might want to indicate that, “With this policy action, the

Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for

the next few quarters are roughly equal.  Similarly, the upside and downside risks to the goal of price

stability are seen as roughly equal.”  In order to leave a sense that additional policy

tightening was likely at some point but that the Committee did not foresee a rapid

return to a neutral stance, the statement could end with “Even following today’s action, the



12

Committee judges that the stance of policy is quite accommodative.  However, with inflation low and

resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a

measured pace.”  While market participants expect policy to tighten in the not-too-

distant future, action at this meeting would come as a considerable surprise, especially

given the reference to patience included in the March statement.  Market interest rates

would likely move significantly higher, stock prices would fall, and the dollar would

rally.  If investors took the final sentence of the statement to heart, then these

reactions might be somewhat damped.    

(13) While the Committee might find some encouragement in the stronger

tone of recent economic data, it may not yet be convinced that the expansion has

become self-sustaining and may still expect inflation to remain low.  In early 2002, for

instance, the expansion appeared to be gaining traction for a time and market

expectations about the onset of tightening were building, but the expansion

subsequently faltered.  If the Committee believed that the case for tighter policy

would likely require at least several more months of evidence, it might choose a

statement fairly close to the one released following the March meeting, as in

Alternative A.  With investment spending still reported to be primarily for

replacement rather than for expansion and with only one month of reasonably strong

employment data in hand, the Committee may not yet be confident that business

gloom has really lifted all that much.  Indeed, with the impetus to both household and

business spending from expansionary fiscal policy expected to wane over coming

quarters and financial conditions having tightened considerably of late, some members

may be concerned that growth could fall back more than in the staff projection.  The

recent uptick in inflation might be seen as primarily the result of temporary factors

and, therefore, leaving open the possibility that the underlying trend in inflation could

edge lower (much as is discussed in the “Inflation Reversal” simulation in the

Greenbook).  Moreover, some Committee members might see the level of inflation

over the past year as at the low end of its desirable range over the longer term and so

may not be averse to a modest step-up.  Against this backdrop, the Committee may

continue to view downside surprises to inflation as more costly than upside surprises,



13

implying that a cautious approach to monetary policy tightening remains appropriate.  

(14) If the Committee finds sufficient merit in the selection of Alternative A,

it could issue a statement like that shown in the corresponding column of Table 1. 

While the recent increase in inflation should be noted, the statement could indicate

that the rise is likely to be transitory: “Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat

higher, core inflation is expected to remain low.”  Even in this view, the risks to the

attainment of price stability related in the assessment of risks paragraph would

presumably be balanced.  However, with the vigor of the expansion seen as less

certain and the upside risks to inflation less pressing, the Committee might choose to

retain with only minor adjustment the sentence indicating its belief that it can be

“patient in removing its policy accommodation.”  Market participants think that the

Committee is likely to modify or drop the reference to patience in the statement at

this meeting, and its retention would probably lead them to push back somewhat the

expected timing of policy tightening.  The resulting decline in market interest rates

would likely spark a modest rally in stock markets but weigh on the foreign exchange

value of the dollar. 

Money and Debt Forecasts

(15) M2 growth is projected to slow from its recent rapid pace, as the

temporary boost from last quarter’s high level of mortgage refinancing ebbs. 

Nonetheless, this aggregate is expected to grow about 5½ percent this year, about the

same as last year and ½ percentage point faster than projected at the time of the last

Bluebook.  The higher projected growth reflects in part the stronger-than-expected

underlying money growth thus far this year.  Foreign demand for U.S. currency is also

anticipated to rebound from the low growth rate posted in the first quarter. 

Nonetheless, as the economic expansion continues, households are expected to shift

the composition of their portfolios further toward capital market instruments at the

expense of monetary assets, implying a modest rise in M2 velocity this year.  

(16) Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt this year is projected to

remain near the 8 percent pace posted in 2003.  Household debt growth should slow

as higher mortgage rates damp residential investment and refinancing activity, and so



14

trim mortgage debt growth.  However, with increases in investment outlays outpacing

gains in profits, business borrowing should gradually pick up, though from a very low

level.  Federal debt growth is also expected to be a little higher this year, reflecting the

wider deficit, before falling back next year as fiscal policy moves toward restraint.  

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(17) Should the Committee wish to follow the same procedure as at the last

two meetings, it could vote on the directive and on the language of the assessment of

risks.  Draft language with a range of options for the assessment of risks identical to

those presented in Table 1 is provided below.

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO

an average of around _______ 1 percent.

(2) Risk Assessments

(A)  The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly

equal.  Similarly, the upside and downside risks to the goal of price

stability are seen as roughly equal.  Nonetheless, with inflation low and

resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in

removing its policy accommodation.

(B)  The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly



15

equal.  Similarly, the upside and downside risks to the goal of price

stability are seen as roughly equal.  At this juncture, with inflation low

and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy

accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace.       

(C)  With this policy action, the Committee perceives that the upside and

downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few

quarters are roughly equal.  Similarly, the upside and downside risks to

the goal of price stability are seen as roughly equal.  Even following

today’s action, the Committee judges that the stance of policy is quite

accommodative.  However, with inflation low and resource use slack, the

Committee believes that policy accommodation can likely be removed at

a measured pace.
