MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

JULY 31, 2008 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) July 31, 2008 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments         

Summary 

(1) During the intermeeting period, investors’ growing concerns about the 

health of financial institutions, which were exacerbated by the failure of a large 

regional thrift institution, uncertainties about the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie 

Mac, and the difficulties of certain major investment banks, added to market worries 

about the potential consequences of financial strains for the broader economy.  In 

response, market participants pushed back the expected timing of the onset of 

monetary policy tightening.  Concerns about the government-sponsored enterprises 

(GSEs) eased as Congress moved to pass legislation, subsequently signed by the 

President, authorizing the Treasury to provide liquidity and capital to the GSEs.  

Sentiment about the broader financial sector also received a boost from second-

quarter earnings reports of some financial firms that were not as weak as anticipated.   

(2) Investors currently place very high odds on the Committee leaving the 

target federal funds rate unchanged at the upcoming FOMC meeting.  On net over 

the intermeeting period, shorter-horizon TIPS-based measures of inflation 

compensation dropped as energy prices retraced some of their recent rise.  

Functioning of short-term funding markets remained strained.  Broad equity price 

indexes were down on the period; stock prices of financial firms were down sharply in 

mid-July but subsequently recouped most of those losses.  Spreads of yields on 

investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over yields on comparable-

maturity Treasury securities widened.  Bond issuance slowed further, as did lending by 

banks to businesses and households, and issuance of leveraged loans remained very 

weak.  In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS), large fractions of 



banks reported having tightened lending standards further across a wide range of loan 

types over the previous three months.  The trade-weighted index of the dollar against 

the currencies of major trading partners was little changed on net. 

Financial Institutions 

(3) Financial markets were roiled over the intermeeting period by developments 

at major financial institutions.  The stock prices of the GSEs tumbled and their credit 

default swap (CDS) spreads shot up early in the period amid concerns that their 

capital would be insufficient to absorb mounting losses on their mortgage portfolios 

(Chart 1).  The worries about the GSEs were augmented by speculation that a large 

amount of previously issued mortgage-backed securities (MBS) might need to be 

brought back onto the GSEs’ balance sheets.  On July 13, the Treasury Department 

proposed a rescue plan to support the liquidity and solvency of the two institutions, 

and the Federal Reserve announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was 

authorized to lend to the institutions if necessary.  Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s 

stock prices subsequently retraced a portion of their earlier declines in response to the 

announcement, and their CDS spreads, which had narrowed in anticipation of the 

government action, moved even lower.  The housing bill passed by the Congress and 

signed by the President gives the Treasury Department the authority to provide 

support to the two GSEs through loans and equity investments, and assigns to the 

Federal Reserve a consultative role with regard to the safety and soundness of the 

GSEs and potential provisions of capital. 

(4) Developments at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac left an imprint on agency-

related cash and financing markets.  The ability of the two GSEs to issue debt 

received considerable scrutiny in July as investors tried to gauge the institutions’ 

health.  Weekly auctions of short-term debt were reasonably well covered but at 

higher rates than previously:  Spreads of three- and six-month auction stop-out rates

over comparable-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rates widened to their highest 

level since the beginning of the year.  Developments at the GSEs spurred higher 

short-term borrowing costs at the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs).  Secondary-

market yields on the FHLBs’ discount notes moved higher, and many dealers stopped 

reporting quotes for CDS spreads on FHLB debt, an indication that liquidity in this 

market was impaired.  Anecdotal reports suggest that foreign official demand for 

agency debt has dropped off, but custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York have continued to rise.  In repo markets, spreads of rates on agency and 

agency MBS collateral over Treasury general collateral (GC) repo rates widened 

modestly in response to the concerns about the GSEs, but did not reach the levels 

seen in March.  Dealer haircuts on agency debt collateral increased somewhat, and 

bid-asked spreads for these transactions increased noticeably.  Meanwhile, haircuts on 

agency MBS collateral were little changed and bid-asked spreads on these transactions 

increased only modestly. 

(5) Likely reflecting reduced demand for agency MBS, constraints on GSEs 

balance sheets, and difficult liquidity conditions in mortgage markets, option-adjusted 

spreads (OAS) of agency MBS yields over those on Treasuries widened about 25 basis 

points, on net, over the intermeeting period.  However, the agencies continued to 

perform their securitization role without disruption.  Domestic banks sold significant 

amounts of conforming mortgages to the agencies ahead of quarter end, boosting 

MBS issuance in June.  Issuance of agency MBS appears to have slowed somewhat in 

July, likely reflecting the weak pace of underlying originations.  In contrast, issuance 

by Ginnie Mae (the Government National Mortgage Association) rose in July, 

extending a trend since mid-2007, as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has 

begun to guarantee mortgages that, until recently, would likely have been issued 

without federal guarantee and securitized as non-agency MBS.

(6) Investors also became more concerned about the outlook for the broader 

banking sector.  The failures of a large thrift and two small commercial banks raised 

investors’ concerns about the profitability and asset quality of depositories and caused 

stock prices of banks to swing widely over the intermeeting period.1  Most large bank 

holding companies reported significantly lower earnings in the second quarter than at 

the same time last year and boosted their provisions for loan losses in light of higher 

delinquency and charge-off rates.  CDS spreads for large U.S. commercial banks were 

also volatile over the intermeeting period, and ended the period a little higher, on 

balance.  CDS spreads for regional banks moved up noticeably, and in response to 

market rumors, two regional depository institutions issued statements in mid-July 

reassuring investors about the strength of their liquidity positions and their ability to 

raise funds. 

(7) Investment banks’ equity prices also declined and their CDS spreads 

widened early in the period, although the declines were subsequently partly reversed.  

Anxiety about the financial condition of some institutions, particularly Lehman 

Brothers, reemerged for some time over the intermeeting period.  Merrill Lynch 

reported large second-quarter losses, reflecting significant credit valuation adjustments 

on mortgage-related assets.  On July 28, the firm announced expected writedowns for 

the third quarter of almost $6 billion resulting from a large sale of collaterized debt 

obligations backed by asset-backed securities (ABS CDOs) for a price well below their 

face value, and the termination of ABS CDO hedges with a monoline guarantor.  The 

firm also indicated that it would enhance its capital position through substantial 

issuance of new equity.  Anecdotal reports suggest that the ability of investment banks 

to raise capital in the current environment is very limited.  
                                           
1 The failure of IndyMac—a thrift with $32 billion in assets—on July 11, 2008, is expected to 
cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund between $4 and $8 billion, making it one of the 
largest bank failures in U.S. history.  The Federal Reserve extended credit to IndyMac for a 
brief period to facilitate an orderly closure and least-cost resolution of the institution.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(8) The FOMC’s decision at its June meeting to leave the target federal funds 

rate unchanged at 2 percent had largely been anticipated, but the policy statement was 

reportedly viewed by investors as placing more emphasis on the downside risks to 

growth than they had anticipated.  As a result, short-term interest rate futures 

maturing in 2009 fell 10 to 15 basis points on the announcement.2  The Chairman’s 

Monetary Policy Testimony also led investors to mark down the expected path of the 

federal funds rate, as did intensifying concerns about the health of financial 

institutions and the outlook for the GSEs.  Economic data released over the 

intermeeting period had little net impact on the anticipated path for policy.  Judging 

from options on federal funds futures, investors attach very high odds to no change in 

the target rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting, as do respondents to the Desk’s 

survey of primary dealer economists (Chart 2).  Futures quotes suggest that investors 

currently expect the federal funds rate to reach 2¼ percent by early 2009 and about 

3½ percent by mid 2010, about 40 and 50 basis points lower than at the time of the 

June meeting, respectively.  Respondents to the Desk’s survey anticipated the federal 

funds rate would reach 2¾ percent by the end of 2009, about 25 basis points less than 

implied by futures rates.  The option-implied distributions of the federal funds rate six 

and twelve months ahead moved lower over the intermeeting period, and policy 

uncertainty, as measured by the width of these distributions, decreased to about the 

middle of its range since last August, but remained high by historical standards.  

(9) Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 30 basis points over the 

intermeeting period, in line with the revision to policy expectations, while ten-year 

                                           
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.02 percent over the intermeeting period.  
Volatility in the market, though elevated by historical standards, was lower than it had been 
over the last several intermeeting periods. Over this intermeeting period, the volume of long-
term repurchase agreements (RPs) was unchanged, and the Desk did not redeem any 
Treasury securities.

yields declined about 10 basis points, on net.  Five-year inflation compensation 

adjusted for carry effects decreased 36 basis points, tracking the decline in energy 

prices, whereas five-year inflation compensation five years forward rose 18 basis 

points.  Much of the increase occurred around the release of the June FOMC 

statement, the Chairman’s testimony, and higher-than-expected CPI inflation data.  

One-year forward rates of inflation compensation ending eight through ten years 

ahead rose more noticeably, suggesting some increase in inflation expectations or 

inflation risk premiums (see the box “Interpreting Movements in TIPS-based 

Inflation Compensation”).  Readings of household inflation expectations from the 

Michigan survey released over the intermeeting period remained elevated; the short-

term measure was unchanged, while the long-term measure declined slightly.  Many 

respondents to the Desk’s primary dealer survey stated that they had become more 

uncertain about their inflation forecasts for core PCE inflation over the next two 

years, although their inflation forecasts were little changed.  

Money Markets 

(10) Functioning in the interbank funding markets remained strained over the 

intermeeting period.  Banks reportedly continued to be reluctant to lend term funds, 

and the spreads of one- and three-month Libor over comparable-maturity OIS rates 

were unchanged and slightly higher, respectively (Chart 3).  Also indicative of 

sustained bank funding pressures, stop-out rates of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) 

during the intermeeting period were above the primary credit rate.  Demand at the 

ECB and SNB auctions of dollar funding remained strong, and the ECB’s auctions in 

July drew record volumes of bids.  Pressures in foreign funding markets eased slightly 

during the period.  With the passing of quarter-end, overnight sterling and euro Libor 

fell about 20 and 30 basis points, respectively.  Term spreads between Libor and OIS 

rates in these currencies also declined since the June meeting; in the case of sterling,

Interpreting Movements in TIPS based Inflation Compensation  

Over the intermeeting period, inflation compensation for the next five years—the spread 
 between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities—declined 36 basis points.  In 
 contrast, inflation compensation from five to ten years ahead increased 18 basis points.  
 These diverging movements raise the question of whether the increase in longer-term 
 inflation compensation reflects higher long-run inflation expectations, an increase in 
 inflation risk premiums, or other factors.  Much of the rise in forward inflation 
 compensation occurred around FOMC communications that were interpreted by 
 investors as suggesting a lower path for policy and the release of higher-than–expected 
 CPI data—both of which could result in either higher long-run inflation expectations or 
 greater inflation uncertainty. 

An examination of the forward term structure of inflation compensation, shown on the 
 left below, sheds some light on these issues.  First, the declines in near-term forward rates 
 of inflation compensation are consistent with the drop in oil prices over the intermeeting 
 period, and staff models of inflation compensation suggest that this factor explains about 
 half of the fall in five-year inflation compensation.  Second, the increase in the slope of 
forward inflation compensation beyond five years suggests that part of the increase in 
longer-term inflation compensation owes to higher inflation risk premiums.  This follows 
if we assume that investors’ expectations for inflation beyond six or seven years ahead are 
mainly determined by their views of the long-run equilibrium level of inflation and so are 
about flat.  It is notable that the forward pattern of inflation compensation measured 
from inflation swaps, shown to the right below, follows the same general pattern as that 
from TIPS except at very long horizons, perhaps suggesting that some of the increase in 
far-forward TIPS-based inflation compensation could also be due to special factors in 
Treasury markets; in particular, a sense that the Treasury may need to issue more longer-
term debt to finance a widening federal deficit may have put upward pressure on longer-
term nominal yields.  Of course, the readings from the inflation swaps market, which is 
quite small and illiquid, may also be influenced by special factors.   

Survey evidence released over the intermeetting period was mixed but also points to an 
increase in inflation risk premiums and little change or a slight decline in long-term 
inflation expectations.   The Desk’s survey of primary dealers showed a significant 
increase in the number of dealers who reported they were more uncertain about their 
forecasts for core PCE inflation, but no change in the median forecast for either near-
term core PCE or long-term headline CPI inflation.  The Michigan survey of households 
showed no change in inflation expectations over the next twelve months and a modest 
decline in inflation expectations over the next five to ten years, although both these 
measures remained at elevated levels.

In addition to risk premiums and expectations, TIPS-based inflation compensation can be
affected by the relative liquidity of nominal and inflation-indexed coupon securities.  
Although liquidity in Treasury markets remains poorer than before August 2007, 
conditions have not changed much of late, suggesting that liquidity did not contribute 
importantly to changes in inflation compensation over the intermeeting period.

this may partly have reflected British banks’ borrowing from the Bank of England’s 

special liquidity facility. 

(11) Depository institutions’ use of both overnight and term primary credit 

borrowing continued to be strong during the intermeeting period, peaking in late June 

amid quarter-end pressures.  By contrast, extensions of credit through the Primary 

Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) were negligible during July.  On July 30, the Board of 

Governors and the FOMC announced enhancements to existing liquidity facilities, 

including the extension of the PDCF and Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) 

through January 30, 2009, the introduction of auctions on options on draws of the 

TSLF, and an increase in the maturity of loans available through the TAF to 84 days.  

The announcement of the initiatives was reportedly received positively by market 

participants with some bank funding rates moving down in response.  Traders in the 

FX swap market reported that liquidity and volumes improved in that market as a 

result of the new measures, and implied basis spreads on one- and three-month euro-

dollar swaps fell about 5 basis points after the announcement. 

(12) In other short-term funding markets, conditions in repo markets were fairly 

stable, although there was some deterioration of conditions in the market for agency 

collateral.  The overnight Treasury GC repo rate traded relatively close to the federal 

funds rate during much of the intermeeting period, and haircuts on non-Treasury, 

non-agency collateral were little changed at elevated levels.  The modest increase in 

repo spreads for agency debt and agency MBS likely contributed to the 

oversubscription of the TSLF auction held on July 24.  The other TSLF auctions held 

during the intermeeting period were undersubscribed.  Demand for 28-day single-

tranche repurchase agreements increased moderately in recent weeks.  Strains in the 

functioning of the Treasury bill market were evident just before quarter-end and 

around the times of heightened investor concern regarding the GSEs, when market 

participants reported high bid-asked spreads for these securities.  In the commercial 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 12 of 36



paper market, spreads on lower-rated nonfinancial paper and asset-backed commercial 

paper remained well above historical norms. 

Capital Markets 

(13) Broad equity price indexes fell about 3 to 4 percent, on balance, over the 

intermeeting period.  Energy sector stocks significantly underperformed the broad 

indexes, owing to recent declines in oil prices.  Financial sector stocks were volatile, 

buffeted by news about specific institutions and the flow of earnings reports, and 

ended the period about unchanged.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 

changed little, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  The spread between the 

twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and the real long-

term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—climbed to the top 

of its range since the early 1980s.   

(14) Yields on most investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds rose 

over the intermeeting period, even though comparable-maturity Treasury yields were 

little changed, implying a widening of already elevated spreads.  According to the July 

SLOOS, large fractions of banks again reported having tightened lending standards 

and terms over the past three months for major business loan categories.  In the 

primary market for leveraged loans, spreads to Libor remained elevated.  Conditions 

in the secondary market remained strained, with bid-asked spreads a bit wider and the 

average bid price modestly lower.  Implied spreads on the LCDX indexes rose sharply 

in late June but have not returned to the peak levels of earlier this year.  The ratio of 

municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasury yields remained above its 

historical average, but functioning appeared smooth amid fairly strong gross issuance.  

(15) Interest rates on fixed-rate conforming mortgages increased over the 

intermeeting period, leaving spreads over ten-year Treasury securities higher.  Offer 

rates on thirty-year jumbo mortgages also rose and credit for nonconforming 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 13 of 36



mortgages remained difficult to obtain.  Indeed, the July SLOOS indicated that over 

the last three months, a large fraction of banks again tightened credit standards on all 

classes of residential mortgage loans.  Issuance of agency MBS appears to have slowed 

in July from its strong second quarter pace, while issuance of private-label RMBS 

backed by nonconforming loans and of commercial mortgage-backed securities 

(CMBS) remained negligible.  The proportion of banks reporting having tightened 

standards in recent months on consumer loans, including credit card loans, was at a 

record high in the July SLOOS, and a majority of respondents reported weaker 

demand for consumer loans.  Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) 

appears to have slowed in recent months.  Spreads on consumer ABS remained high 

by historical standards.  Spreads on lower-rated student loan ABS were also elevated 

and rose further over the period.  

Foreign Developments 

(16) Concerns about the GSEs weighed on the dollar and foreign stock markets, 

but both rebounded in the wake of improved investor sentiment when the rescue plan 

for the GSEs was announced and U.S. financial-sector earnings reports generally 

came in above market expectations.  The major currencies index depreciated almost 

2 percent between July 7 and July 15, when worries about the GSEs were at their 

height, but recovered as investor sentiment improved and ended the period little 

changed on net (Chart 4).  Major foreign stock markets retraced some of their earlier 

declines as well but ended the period about 3 to 5 percent lower, on net, amid signs 

that economic growth is slowing.   

(17) As expected, the ECB raised its policy rate by 25 basis points to 4¼ percent 

on July 3, after which it indicated that it considered the stance of policy to be neutral.  

With growth slowing and oil prices down, expectations of further policy tightening in 

the major foreign economies diminished.  Ten-year sovereign bond yields declined

some 15 to 30 basis points in the euro area, United Kingdom, and Japan, mainly 

reflecting declines in inflation compensation.  

(18) The dollar’s value against the currencies of our other important trading 

partners declined about 1 percent as the Chinese renminbi rose a further ½ percent 

against the dollar and the Korean won, Mexican peso, and Brazilian real all appreciated 

2 to 2½ percent against the dollar.  Central banks in many emerging market 

economies continued to tighten policy in response to rising food and energy prices.  

Emerging stock markets were mixed but generally down, some more than 10 percent, 

and several Asian countries intervened to prop up falling share prices.  

Debt and Money 

(19) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have 

expanded at a 3¾ percent rate in the second quarter, down from the 6 percent pace 

seen in the first quarter (Chart 5).  The slowdown was broad-based across the 

household and business sectors.  Home mortgage debt growth slowed further, 

reflecting ongoing declines in house prices, slower home sales, and tighter terms and 

standards on mortgages.  Debt growth in the nonfinancial business sector continued 

to moderate in the second quarter and appears to have stepped down further in July.  

Issuance of investment-grade bonds and the pace of C&I lending were subdued.  

Issuance of leveraged loans remained very low in the second quarter and, after rising 

in May, high-yield bond issuance has fallen back.  The decline in leveraged loan 

issuance over the past year owes in large part to a drop in leveraged buyouts, which 

have typically been funded by nonbank institutions, including collateralized debt 

obligations (CLOs).  Issuance of CLOs has all but vanished since last August.  

Commercial bank credit appears to have slowed of late.  C&I loans grew at a slower 

pace in the second quarter than earlier in the year and decelerated further in July.  

Growth of loans to households also declined, although a sharp contraction in

residential mortgage loans in June reflected a few domestic banks moving conforming 

loans off their balance sheets and to the GSEs.  Although the quarterly pattern of 

Federal debt growth has been volatile this year, Federal borrowing has picked up in 

recent months, in part to fund the fiscal stimulus plan and because of slower growth 

of tax revenues.3 

(20) M2 expanded at a moderate pace in July, reversing the deceleration in May 

and June.  The expansion was broad based, reflecting acceleration in liquid deposits as 

well as renewed inflows to retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs) and small 

time deposits.  The pickup in growth of small time deposits was largely attributable to 

a single institution that offered substantially higher rates, and the growth of MMMFs 

may have owed to safe-haven flows away from equity mutual funds and other non-

monetary assets.  Currency expanded strongly in June and July, in contrast to the 

subdued pace earlier in the year.  The stronger growth of currency appears to have 

mainly reflected greater domestic demand, but some indicators suggest that foreign 

demand for dollars may also have picked up from its recent sluggish pace. 

 

 

 

 

 

                                           
3 In conjunction with the housing bill, the federal debt limit ceiling was raised by 
$800 billion.  The Treasury’s August quarterly refunding statement indicated larger issuance 
of ten- and thirty-year debt to meet the higher anticipated funding needs of the federal 
government.

Economic Outlook 

(21) The staff has not appreciably altered the outlook for real activity and 

inflation.  The Greenbook projection for economic growth has been marked down a 

bit and shows a slightly more gradual acceleration of the economy relative to the June 

forecast.  The projection for headline inflation this round is slightly lower this year 

and slightly higher next.  The forecast continues to be conditioned on an assumption 

that the target federal funds rate is held at 2 percent this year and that policy will then 

be firmed by a total of 75 basis points over 2009.  Long-term Treasury yields are 

projected to remain steady this year and next.  Stock prices again are expected to 

increase at an annual rate of about 7 percent over the remainder of this year and 12 

percent next year, as the equity risk premium slowly falls towards its long-run mean.  

The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate at an annual 

rate of 2½ percent, while the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil is expected to 

remain around its current level of $124 per barrel over the projection period.  In the 

forecast, falling home prices, the increase in oil prices over the past several quarters, 

and financial stress continue to restrain economic activity in the medium term.  All 

told, real GDP is projected to expand at about a ½ percent annual rate over the 

second half of the year and to pick up to 2¼ percent next year, a bit below the staff’s 

estimate of the growth rate of potential output.  The unemployment rate is projected 

to be somewhat higher than in the previous forecast, owing in part to the temporary 

effects of the recent extension of unemployment benefits, which are assumed to 

induce some unemployed individuals to extend their job search.  Because the 

development is assumed to lead to a commensurate temporary increase in the 

NAIRU, staff anticipates that it will have no significant effect on inflation.  With the 

price of oil remaining near its current level, total PCE inflation is projected to slow 

from over 3½ percent over the second half of 2008 to about 2¼ percent in 2009.  

The projection for 2009 is ¼ percentage point higher than in the June Greenbook, 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 19 of 36



partially reflecting an upward revision to expected food prices.  The staff forecast for 

core PCE inflation steps down from about 2½ percent over the second half of this 

year to 2¼ percent next year as import prices flatten out, energy cost pass-through 

effects diminish, and economic slack reduces price pressures.  

(22) The staff forecast has been extended beyond 2009 using the FRB/US 

model with adjustments to ensure consistency with the staff’s assessment of longer-

run trends.  The extended forecast embeds several key assumptions:  Monetary policy 

aims to stabilize PCE inflation in the long run at a level of 1¾ percent; trend 

multifactor productivity grows a bit above 1 percent per year; after 2009, the real 

value of the dollar depreciates at about 1¼ percent per year; fiscal policy is essentially 

neutral; and energy prices remain roughly constant, but at a lower level than in the 

June projection.  As with the near-term outlook, the extended projection is largely 

unchanged from the June forecast.  Real GDP increases about 3 percent per year 

from 2010 through 2012, about ½ percentage point above the growth rate of 

potential.  The unemployment rate declines to about 4¾ percent only at the end of 

the projection period, to a level about in line with the staff’s view of the NAIRU after 

the temporary effects of the extended unemployment compensation have ceased.  

Given the persistence of slack over most of the period, PCE inflation declines to 

1¾ percent by 2011. 

Update on Monetary Policy Strategies  

(23) As shown in Chart 6, estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate are 

changed from those presented in the June Bluebook.  The Greenbook-consistent 

estimate of short-run r* is 0.1 percent, only slightly higher than in June, as the real 

effects of a higher starting level of output and lower oil prices are judged to have been 

largely offset by more restrictive financial conditions.  This measure of r* is fairly 

close to the actual real federal funds rate, which is currently -0.2 percent when

expected inflation is measured on the same basis used for the various r* estimates—

that is, by realized core PCE inflation over the past four quarters.4  The FRB/US 

model-based estimate of short-run r* has fallen 50 basis points, to -0.1 percent.  

However, this revision mainly reflects a modification in the model’s structure that has 

altered its assessment of the strength of aggregate demand, not the model’s 

interpretation of the news received since late June.  Estimates of short-run r* from the 

small structural model and the single-equation model are little changed from the last 

Bluebook.  

(24) Chart 7 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the long-run Greenbook forecast beyond 2009.  In these simulations, policymakers 

place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal, on keeping 

unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in the nominal federal 

funds rate.5  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), the 

                                           
4 As shown in the lower panel of the table, alternative measures of the real funds rate that 
use headline inflation rather than core inflation are about unchanged relative to the previous 
Bluebook.  Care should be taken in comparing these alternative measures of the actual real 
federal funds rate to the r* values shown.  Such a comparison would require that the same 
measure of expected inflation be used to calculate both rates and comparing the value of r* 
to an average value of the real federal funds rate over 12 quarters (the period used in the 
calculation of the r* measures).  Using lagged core inflation as a proxy for inflation 
expectations, as has generally been the case in the Bluebook, and the staff assumption for 
the path of policy, the Greebook-consistent r* is 0.1 percent and the average value for the 
real funds rate over the next twelve quarters is 0.5 percent.  In contrast, if one uses lagged 
headline inflation to approximate expected inflation, the Greenbook-consistent rate is -0.4 
percent and the average real funds rate over the next twelve quarters is 0.1 percent.  Finally, 
if projected headline inflation is used as a proxy for inflation expectations, the Greenbook-
consistent r* is 0.3 percent and the average real funds rate over the next twelve quarters is 
0.7 percent.  Note that in all three cases the difference between the Greenbook-consistent r* 
and the average real funds rate on the same basis is about ½ percentage point.  
 
5  Consistent with the staff assumptions in the Greenbook, the effective value of the NAIRU 
used in the loss function is boosted 20 basis points over the second half of 2008 and in 2009 
to control for the temporary effects of increased extended unemployment insurance 
benefits.  In these projections, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by the

optimal funds rate climbs from just above 2¼ percent to about 4 percent by the end 

of 2012.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the funds 

rate remains close to its current value through mid 2010 and then rises to about 4½ 

percent.  In both cases, these prescriptions are essentially the same as in the June 

Bluebook because the projected trajectories of core PCE inflation and resource 

utilization have changed little, once allowance is made for the temporary effects of 

increased unemployment insurance benefits on the effective value of the NAIRU. 

(25)  As depicted in Chart 8, the outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes 

a funds rate path nearly identical to that in the previous Bluebook; the federal funds 

rate remains near 2 percent through the fourth quarter of this year, rises gradually to 

3¼ percent by the fourth quarter of 2009, and then stays between 3½ and 3¾ percent 

through the end of 2012.  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate a 70 

percent probability that the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall in the 

range of 2 to 4½ percent at the end of 2009.  Financial market quotes imply that the 

funds rate will remain at 2 percent in the current quarter but rise steadily from around 

3 percent at the end of 2009 to around 4¼ percent by the end of 2012.  This path is 

between 25 and 70 basis points lower than at the time of the previous Bluebook.  The 

confidence intervals implied by interest rate caps indicate a decreased probability of 

tightening between now and 2012, and the probability distribution remains skewed to 

the downside.  Reflecting spending data for the second quarter that were stronger 

than anticipated, the prescriptions from the two Taylor rules are a notch higher than 

those shown in the previous Bluebook.  Those from the first difference rule are 

essentially the same for the third quarter but slightly lower for the fourth quarter.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(26) This Bluebook presents two alternatives for the Committee’s consideration, 

summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative B, the target 

federal funds rate would be maintained at 2 percent at this meeting, while Alternative 

C involves a 25 basis point tightening to 2¼ percent.  The statements for both 

alternatives note that inflation has been high.  Alternative B leaves the stance of policy 

unchanged, but the statement places somewhat greater emphasis on inflation risks 

than the Committee’s statement in June.  Alternative C, after noting the possibility 

that inflation may not moderate as the Committee anticipates, states that the policy 

action was intended to better balance the risks to its goals. 

(27) If the Committee views the staff forecast, which is conditioned on an 

unchanged target federal funds rate through the end of the year, as reasonable and 

sees the outcome as acceptable in the circumstances, it may wish to leave the policy 

rate unchanged at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  The Committee, like the staff, 

may expect financial conditions and the sharp contraction in the housing market to 

exert considerable restraint on aggregate spending over the next year or so, and thus 

may view a relatively low real federal funds rate as necessary to promote moderate 

economic growth.  At the same time, the resilience to date in consumer spending may 

provide some assurance to policy makers that overall economic activity, though 

sluggish, is continuing to expand and is likely to accelerate gradually in coming 

quarters as the contraction in the housing sector begins to fade and financial market 

conditions begin to improve.  The actual real federal funds rate based on lagged four-

quarter core PCE inflation is roughly in line with its Greenbook-consistent 

equilibrium value (Chart 6), a setting consistent with output moving back toward 

potential over the next few years.  Of course, headline inflation has been elevated, and 

is likely to jump this quarter, reflecting the earlier surge in crude oil prices.  But, with 

oil prices having stepped back down in recent weeks and with economic slack likely to

Rationale 

3. The Committee expects inflation to 
moderate later this year and next year.  
However, in light of the continued increases in 
the prices of energy and some other 
commodities and the elevated state of some 
indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty 
about the inflation outlook remains high. 

Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier 
increases in the prices of energy and some 
other commodities, and some indicators of 
inflation expectations have been elevated.  
The Committee expects inflation to moderate 
later this year and next year, but uncertainty 
about the inflation outlook remains high. 

Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier 
increases in the prices of energy and some 
other commodities, and some indicators of 
inflation expectations have been elevated.  
Although the Committee expects inflation to 
moderate later this year and next year, the 
possibility that inflation may fail to decline as 
anticipated is of significant concern. 

Assessment of Risk 4. The substantial easing of monetary policy 
to date, combined with ongoing measures to 
foster market liquidity, should help to promote 
moderate growth over time.  Although 
downside risks to growth remain, they appear 
to have diminished somewhat, and the upside 
risks to inflation and inflation expectations 
have increased.  The Committee will continue 
to monitor economic and financial 
developments and will act as needed to 
promote sustainable economic growth and 
price stability. 

Although downside risks to growth remain, 
the upside risks to inflation are also of 
significant concern to the Committee.  The 
Committee will continue to monitor 
economic and financial developments and 
will act as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability. 

The Committee took this action to better 
balance the upside risks to inflation and the 
downside risks to growth.  The Committee 
will continue to monitor economic and 
financial developments and will act as needed 
to promote sustainable economic growth and 
price stability.

increase in coming months, the Committee may anticipate that inflation pressures will 

moderate later this year and through next year.  With such an outlook, the Committee 

may judge that holding the funds rate constant at this meeting is appropriate given its 

dual objectives.  Indeed, the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 2 

percent, shown in Chart 7, prescribes a target funds rate that remains at roughly its 

current level through the end of 2009 before beginning to firm thereafter.  The 

Committee may also see risk considerations as arguing for an unchanged stance of 

policy at this meeting.  Surely, the downside risks to growth remain significant:  

Consumer spending could weaken substantially, given the low level of consumer 

confidence, the weakening labor market, and diminishing credit availability; fiscal 

policy may provide less impetus than currently anticipated; and financial markets 

remain under considerable stress and may impose more restraint on growth than 

currently anticipated.  At the same time, the persistent tendency of energy prices to 

increase in recent years—and importantly, the resulting upward pressure on inflation 

and inflation expectations—may cause the Committee to feel that the upside risks to 

inflation are also substantial.  Overall, the Committee may still see considerable 

uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation.  In these circumstances, 

the Committee may wish to leave the target funds rate unchanged and await further 

economic and financial information before adjusting the stance of policy. 

(28) In the statement under Alternative B, most of the discussion of the outlook 

for growth is little changed from June.  The statement notes that economic activity 

has continued to expand, “partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and 

exports.”  This characterization has been changed from “some firming in household 

spending” because consumer spending slowed a bit in the second quarter and 

increases in exports have been contributing significantly to output growth and are 

expected to continue to do so.  The statement again notes that “labor markets have 

softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress.”  The 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 28 of 36



language refers to “elevated energy prices” instead of “the rise in energy prices” 

because oil and natural gas prices have moved down, on net, since the last meeting, 

but remain high.  The statement under Alternative B would differ from the one in 

June by moving the sentence stating that past policy easing and Federal Reserve 

liquidity facilities should “promote moderate economic growth” from the assessment 

of risks paragraph to the economic rationale paragraph.  In so doing, the factors that 

explain the outlook for economic activity are consolidated in the same paragraph, 

making the treatment parallel to that of the outlook for inflation.  The rationale 

section makes the frank observation that “inflation has been high,” and attributes this 

situation to the previous increases in energy and other commodity prices.  While the 

statement continues to note that the Committee expects inflation to moderate 

through time, it also indicates that “uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains 

high.”  The assessment goes on to state that “although downside risks to growth 

remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee.”  

Although it does not explicitly make a judgment as to the relative weight of these 

risks, on the whole the statement gives a bit more emphasis to the upside risks to 

inflation than the June statement.  The statement uses the same language as in June to 

note that the Committee will monitor developments and will “act as needed” to 

achieve its dual objectives. 

(29) Futures and options quotes suggest that investors do not expect any change 

in policy until the end of this year.  Moreover, market participants have taken 

particular note of monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period that 

seemed to stress the significant downside risks to economic growth, and most 

respondents to the Desk’s survey do not expect the statement to suggest increased 

inflation concerns.  As a result, the language envisioned under Alternative B might 

lead investors to conclude that policy tightening may commence sooner than currently 

thought.  Short-term interest rates would probably increase a bit following such an 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 29 of 36



announcement.  Longer-term interest rates would likely also move higher, but 

inflation compensation might tick down if investors surmised that policymakers were 

a little less tolerant of inflation than currently perceived.  Equity prices would 

probably decline some, while the exchange value of the dollar might increase. 

(30) If the Committee sees the economy as growing more robustly than the staff 

does and has fairly high confidence in the resilience of financial markets, it may prefer 

to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C.  Members may 

view the current stance of policy as too accommodative, providing substantial impetus 

to aggregate demand at a time when the economy apparently retains an unexpected 

degree of momentum and when inflation expectations may be less tightly moored 

than previously.  If the Committee is more upbeat about the underlying strength of 

the economy than the staff, along the lines of the “Resilient spending” Greenbook 

alternative scenario, members may believe that the time is right to reduce the current 

degree of policy accommodation so as to foster the desired moderation in inflation.  

Although financial market conditions remain strained, and downside risks to growth 

persist, members may see those risks as having diminished considerably over recent 

months and believe that some of the policy accommodation that served as insurance 

against an extremely adverse outcome for economic growth should be removed.  This 

view may be strengthened by the expectation that the various measures that the 

Federal Reserve has put in place to bolster market liquidity, including the new steps 

announced on July 30, will help to mitigate the risk that policy tightening could have 

an outsized impact on financial market functioning.  Moreover, high readings on 

inflation have persisted for some time and could be causing inflation expectations to 

move higher, as illustrated in the Greenbook’s “Inflation spiral” scenario.  Finally, 

members may wish to bring inflation down more rapidly than in the Greenbook 

projection and thus wish to begin tightening policy at this meeting, perhaps along the 

lines of the optimal control simulation with an inflation target of 1½ percent.

(31) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in 

Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B.  This cautious view of the prospects 

for economic growth might suggest to markets that adoption of this alternative did 

not necessarily represent the beginning of an aggressive policy tightening episode.  

However, unlike Alternative B, Alternative C cites the “accommodative stance of 

monetary policy” rather than just the past policy easings as a factor that should 

support growth in the future.  The inflation paragraph in Alternative C, like that in 

Alternative B, notes that “inflation has been high.”  The statement goes on to 

emphasize that “the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of 

significant concern” to the Committee and then notes that the policy firming at this 

meeting was intended to “better balance” the risks to growth and inflation.  This 

language does not claim that the risks after the move would be completely balanced, 

thus leaving the door open to subsequent policy firming, but the statement does not 

suggest that such firming would necessarily be imminent. 

(32) Investors marked down their expected policy path over the intermeeting 

period and now place very low odds on a rate hike at this meeting, or indeed before 

the end of the year.  Accordingly, they would be quite surprised by the adoption of 

Alternative C.  The expected trajectory for the federal funds rate would be marked up, 

perhaps substantially.  Short-term rates would rise accordingly, as the new, higher path 

for policy was built into asset prices.  Longer-term rates would probably increase as 

well, but inflation compensation would likely decline a bit, as investors concluded that 

the Committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation.  Equity prices 

would fall on the news, while the exchange value of the dollar would probably 

appreciate.  If market participants interpreted this action as implying that policy would 

be tightened fairly rapidly in the near term, strains in financial markets could worsen, 

and perhaps significantly so if a tighter path for policy was seen as likely to depress 

house prices further or more rapidly than currently expected.  In response to the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 31 of 36



emphasis given to inflation developments in the statement, investors might respond 

more sharply to incoming news bearing directly on consumer prices over subsequent 

weeks. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(33) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to expand 6¼ percent this 

year, up ½ percentage point from the June forecast.  That shift reflects an upward 

revision to the staff’s outlook for nominal GDP growth for the year and a downward 

revision to the opportunity cost of holding money, given the recent drop in market 

interest rates.  M2 is projected to expand 4¼ percent in 2009, the same as in the June 

forecast but more slowly than nominal GDP, as the opportunity cost of holding M2 

assets is projected to begin rising in the third quarter of this year. 

(34) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to slow to 4¾ 

percent in 2008 and to just under 4½ percent in 2009, down significantly from the 

rapid 8¼ percent advance posted last year.  Household borrowing is forecast to 

decelerate, reflecting falling house prices and tighter lending standards and terms on 

consumer loans.  Business borrowing is projected to slow as a result of diminished net 

equity retirements, relatively high corporate bond spreads, and tight bank lending 

standards.  In contrast, federal government debt is expected to accelerate this year and 

next as a variety of factors, including the fiscal stimulus payments and slower growth 

in tax receipts, contribute to wider federal deficits.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 

The equilibrium real rate—i.e., the nominal rate adjusted for expected inflation—is the real federal 
funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its potential level over time.   
The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters 
given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of 
the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that 
monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them 
equal thereafter.  Both concepts of the equilibrium real rate approximate expected inflation using trailing 
four-quarter core PCE inflation.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  

In calculating the actual real funds rate, the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of  
the observed federal funds rate.  Expected inflation is approximated in three ways: using four-quarter 
lagged core inflation, as was done to define the equilibrium real rate; using lagged four-quarter headline 
PCE inflation; and using projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter. 

For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook 
publication date.  Moreover, if the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged 
inflation measure ends in the last quarter and the projected inflation measure starts in the current quarter. 

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( y *t − yt  and y *t t+1| − yt+1|t ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (Δ −4 y 4 *t t+ +3| Δ yt 3|t ), and π *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *ty yt− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
