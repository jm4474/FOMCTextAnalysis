MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Over the intermeeting period, conditions in financial markets generally 

improved but nonetheless remained strained.  Many indicators of financial stress 

spiked in the days immediately before and after the March FOMC meeting amid a 

widespread flight to quality and liquidity.1  However, stresses subsequently eased in 

the wake of the FOMC’s policy action and the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary 

measures to boost liquidity, which helped to calm fears of a worsening of the 

crisis.  Equity prices rose considerably.  Investment-grade bond spreads moved a 

bit lower and speculative-grade credit spreads declined more substantially.  Bid 

prices in the secondary market for leveraged loans recovered somewhat.  

Investment-grade bond issuance held up well.  Treasury cash and repo market 

functioning improved.  However, spreads in interbank term funding markets 

increased, approaching their December highs, and commercial paper (CP) spreads 

also widened.  Banks reported further tightening of terms and standards across a 

range of loan categories in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  

Spreads of rates on conforming mortgage products over those on comparable-

maturity Treasury securities narrowed somewhat but remained high.  Although 

issuance of agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) continued to be 

strong, issuance of non-agency RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities 
                                           
1 Unless otherwise noted, intermeeting changes in U.S. asset prices and yields are calculated 
under the normal practice of using the closing prices on the day before the previous FOMC 
meeting and on Bluebook publication day.  In cases for which sharp movements close to the 
March FOMC meeting make this convention potentially misleading, we provide greater 
detail on price developments.   



 

                                           
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.24 percent over the intermeeting period.  
Volatility of the funds rate remained elevated, comparable to that seen in recent months.  
Over the period, the volume of long-term RPs increased $38 billion, primarily reflecting the 
previously announced expansion of the single-tranche term RP program.  The Desk 
redeemed $44 billion in Treasury bills and sold $91 billion of Treasury securities on an 
outright basis to offset the provision of balances from other sources, including primary 
credit, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Term Auction Facility, the single-tranche term 
RP program, and draws on foreign currency swap arrangements. 

(CMBS) remained close to nil.  Against this backdrop, market participants 

significantly revised upward the expected path for the federal funds rate and 

currently price in only a 10 percent chance of a cut of more than 25 basis points at 

the upcoming FOMC meeting. 

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(2) The 75 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate in March was 

somewhat smaller than markets had expected; near-dated federal funds futures 

rates rose 10 to 15 basis points on the announcement.2  Market reports also 

pointed to the two dissenting votes and to FOMC statement language conveying 

somewhat more concern about inflation than had been expected as factors 

contributing to an increase in the expected future path of interest rates.  The 

Chairman’s testimony on April 2 was viewed as somewhat more optimistic about 

the outlook for economic growth than markets had expected, and rates edged up 

further that day.  Indicators of economic activity and inflation were mixed over the 

intermeeting period, but overall they were apparently viewed in markets as a bit 

stronger than expected.  Investors appeared to mark down the odds on an adverse 

tail event in the near future.  Market participants now expect the federal funds rate 

to decline to about 1.95 percent by late summer, about 60 basis points higher than 

at the time of the March meeting, before rising to 3 percent by the end of 2009

3 Strains in the Libor market are complicating the estimation of monetary policy expectations 
based on longer-horizon Eurodollar futures, perhaps leading to an upward bias in the 
expected future policy path. 

(Chart 1).3  Judging from options on federal funds futures, investors place about 

two-thirds odds on a 25 basis point cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting, with 

most of the remaining probability on no move.  Investors see high odds on rates 

being left unchanged at the June FOMC meeting, and the market-based probability 

of reaching very low interest rates in the next six months has declined significantly.  

The Desk’s survey of primary dealers also indicates that a 25 basis point cut is the 

most likely outcome at the April meeting, but dealers place somewhat higher odds 

on a 50 basis point cut than is implied by market quotes.  Also in contrast to 

options prices, dealers place significant odds on cuts at the June and August 

FOMC meetings and do not anticipate a shift to tighter policy until 2009.    

(3) Yields on Treasury securities declined in the days immediately preceding 

the March FOMC meeting, most notably on shorter-maturity instruments.  Yields 

have since rebounded sharply, with 2- and 10-year yields climbing 95 and 50 basis 

points, respectively, over the intermeeting period.  These increases are consistent 

with both the higher expected path for policy and an easing of investor demands 

for safety and liquidity.  Conditions in the Treasury coupon market had 

deteriorated markedly around the time of the March FOMC meeting, as bid-asked 

spreads widened and shorter-term yields plunged.  Although those conditions have 

since improved, liquidity remains somewhat impaired relative to historical 

averages.  In the TIPS market, the yield on 10-year issues rose in line with its 

nominal counterpart.  Inflation compensation derived from TIPS was very volatile 

around the time of the March FOMC meeting.  Over the intermeeting period, ten-

year inflation compensation was little changed on net, as a moderate increase in 

inflation compensation over the next 5 years was roughly offset by a moderate

decrease in compensation from 5 to 10 years ahead.4  Compared to the levels 

prevailing earlier in March, both the 5-year and 5-to-10-year forward measures of 

inflation compensation have declined, as firmer policy expectations and reduced 

uncertainty may have lowered inflation expectations and risk premiums.  However, 

some other indicators of inflation expectations have increased in recent weeks.  

The staff’s index of inflation expectations and uncertainty, distilled from a 

collection of market and survey data on future inflation levels and risks, edged 

above the top of its 10-year range in March and is estimated to have remained 

there in April, primarily reflecting increases in the Michigan survey of inflation 

expectations at both short and long horizons.  

Money Markets 

(4) The overnight Treasury general collateral (GC) repo rate plummeted on 

the day of the March FOMC meeting and hit a low of 20 basis points for several 

days thereafter, as investors exhibited a strong preference for Treasury securities 

over other collateral (Chart 2).  The overnight GC repo rate recovered to near the 

federal funds target immediately after the first Term Securities Lending Facility 

(TSLF) auction on March 27 and it has remained around that level since.  Dealer 

haircuts on non-Treasury repos—which had widened significantly in the weeks 

before the March FOMC meeting—edged higher on most collateral types over the 

period.  (See box “Developments in Central Banks’ Liquidity Facilities.”)   

(5) Spreads of interbank term funding rates over comparable-maturity 

overnight index swap (OIS) rates have trended up over the intermeeting period,

Developments in Central Banks’ Liquidity Facilities 

The Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities appear to   have eased some of the strains in term funding 
markets.  Dislocations r emain in interbank markets, but liquidity provision to securities dealers 
seems to have satisfied a substantial portion of their need for funding. 

Stress in bank funding markets, combined with the narrowing of the spread between the primary 
credit rate and the target federal funds rate, has led to substantial overnight and term borrowing 
from the primary credit facility.  Most of the borrowing institutions have used the window for their 
own funding needs, but some institutions appear to have used the window to arbitrage the market.  
Many depository institutions, however, apparently are still reluctant to access the discount window, 
and the overnight federal funds market has remained volatile, with trading frequently taking place 
above the primary credit rate, and pronounced tiering of rates across borrowers. 

By contrast, depository institutions have not shied away from the Term Auction Facility (TAF).  
Demand was strong at the March and April TAF auctions; there was a large number of bidders, and 
bid-to-cover ratios were around 1.8 even with auction sizes that were increased to $50 billion.  
Indeed, the stop-out rates at the two auctions in April were well above the primary credit rate and 
near or above term Libor rates. 

Borrowing under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility peaked at around $40 billion in late March and 
has since declined to around $20 billion.  The series of single-tranche term repos operations has 
cumulated to $75 billion, easing funding needs for primary dealers, especially for MBS collateral. 

To maintain the overnight federal funds rate close to its target, the Desk has drained balances to 
offset the liquidity provided through the facilities described above, including outright sales of 
Treasury securities that totaled $91 billion over the intermeeting period.  

Operation of the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) commenced on March 27.  Under the 
TSLF, the Desk lends Treasury securities in exchange for a substantially broader set of collateral 
than accepted in the traditional securities lending facility.  To date, there have been five TSLF 
auctions, offering between $25 billion and $75 billion each.  The April 10 and April 24 schedule 2 
auctions were undersubscribed, apparently reflecting reduced stresses for dealers in funding lower-
quality collateral.  With the increased supply of Treasuries, repo market functioning improved 
notably, Treasury general collateral repo rates rose substantially, and spreads of Treasury repo rates 
over other repo rates narrowed. 

Other central banks have also provided extra liquidity to markets in both domestic currencies and 
in dollars.  The Bank of England conducted two three-month repo auctions during the intermeeting 
period and unveiled a temporary scheme that will allow U.K. banks to swap MBS backed by U.K. 
and European residential mortgages that had been issued before the end of 2007 and other asset-
backed securities in exchange for government bonds for a period of up to three years. The ECB 
and SNB drew upon their swap lines with the Fed to provide dollar funding in conjunction with 
TAF auctions.  The ECB auctioned $15 billion each on March 24, April 7, and April 21, and the 
SNB auctioned $6 billion each on March 25 and April 22.  On March 28, the ECB announced new 
long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) with a six-month maturity; the first LTRO auction on 
April 2 was met with high demand. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 7 of 38



 

                                           
5 There was a widespread belief in late March and early April that banks on the Libor panel 
were understating their borrowing costs, particularly after the ninth TAF auction stopped 
out at a rate above one-month Libor.  Libor-OIS spreads rose notably in mid-April after 
reports that the British Bankers’ Association had admonished members of its panel not to 
contribute deceptive or stale information.  

and they are approaching the highs reached last December.5  Term funding spreads 

also widened in sterling and euro despite several steps taken by foreign central 

banks to ease funding pressures.  The strains in these markets apparently reflect 

mounting pressures on bank balance sheets, continued uncertainty regarding the 

size and distribution of losses on mortgage-related and other assets, and a general 

desire on the part of financial firms to reduce leverage.  The premium on rates 

paid by banks of perceived lower credit quality has increased notably in recent 

weeks. 

(6) Spreads of rates on asset-backed, financial, and lower-rated nonfinancial 

CP over the yield on higher-rated nonfinancial paper all rose in the weeks leading 

up to the March FOMC meeting and they have remained elevated since then.  

However, with the yield on higher-rated paper moving down as a result of policy 

easing, most CP rates are down significantly from last year.  The level of 

outstanding unsecured CP have shown little trend in recent months.  The amount 

of outstanding asset-backed CP continued to decline gradually in the United States 

and Europe.  

Capital Markets  

(7) Broad equity price indexes were volatile at times but rose about 9 

percent on net over the intermeeting period.  Financial sector stocks outperformed 

the broad indexes.  First-quarter results at large financial firms were generally poor 

but roughly in line with market expectations.  However, steps announced by some 

firms to raise new capital and to dispose of troubled assets encouraged investors 

and may have reduced concerns about possible failures of important institutions.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 8 of 38



 

Outside of the financial sector, first-quarter earnings reports have been quite solid 

over the intermeeting period.  The spread between the twelve-month forward 

trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and the real long-term Treasury 

yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—has edged down in recent 

weeks but remains near the upper end of its range over the past two decades.  

Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index declined substantially, and, while 

still above its range in recent years, it is now near its longer-term average.   

(8) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose less than comparable-

maturity Treasury yields, implying some narrowing of spreads from recent high 

levels.  For speculative-grade bonds, yields actually fell, leaving spreads down 

notably from the peaks reached around the time of the March FOMC meeting.  

Credit default swap (CDS) spreads were also down, most notably for large banks 

and broker-dealers.  However, the median CDS spread of a group of regional 

banks, which jumped last month, in part on concerns about deteriorating asset 

quality, has not fallen back.  Issuance of investment-grade bonds continued to be 

robust in March and the first half of April.  After a few months of near-zero 

issuance, speculative-grade bond issuance has picked up slightly of late.  Leveraged 

loan issuance weakened further in the first quarter.  However, secondary market 

bid prices for the most liquid loans extended their rebound from February lows, 

reflecting improved market sentiment as banks reduced their backlogs of 

underwritten deals (Chart 3).  Similarly, implied spreads on the LCDX indexes 

dropped considerably.  Implied volatility in the CDS market remain higher than 

normal. 

(9)     Concerns about the impact of stresses at financial guarantors on the 

municipal bond market appear to have diminished in recent months.  Ratios of 

municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasury yields eased somewhat in 

April after spiking last month, but remain quite high.  Recently, the state of

California announced that it would no longer seek insurance for its bonds from 

financial guarantors.  Issuance of long-term municipal bonds was very strong in 

March and that strength appears to have carried into April.  Some of this issuance 

reflected the refinancing of auction rate securities (ARS) whose auctions failed 

earlier this year.  The troubles in the ARS market have also damped funding for 

student loans.  In addition, the student loan market has been affected by a 

tightening of government-mandated lending terms and a general aversion to 

structured finance products.  Lenders accounting for more than 10 percent of the 

volume of government-guaranteed student lending have exited the market, and 

other large originators announced that they would curtail lending to students 

attending schools with poorer repayment records. 

(10) Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages, which had 

shot up in February, declined significantly in the days before the March FOMC 

meeting.  Over the intermeeting period these rates remained fairly steady.  Posted 

offer rates on 30-year jumbo mortgages have declined slightly on balance since the 

March FOMC meeting.  Overall, spreads between prime mortgage rates and 

comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed substantially over the 

intermeeting period, though they remain high relative to historical norms.  Option-

adjusted yield spreads on agency MBS relative to Treasury securities fell back 

somewhat from their peak just before the March FOMC meeting, but they too 

remain elevated.  Issuance of agency RMBS stayed strong, but issuance of private-

label RMBS backed by nonconforming loans remained very light.  Likewise, 

issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) continued to be 

negligible and spreads on CMBS over swaps remain at historically high levels.

6 There were no foreign official purchases or sales of dollars by reporting central banks in 
industrial countries during the intermeeting period. 

Foreign Developments  

(11) The trade-weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the 

major foreign currencies increased 2¼ percent over the intermeeting period (Chart 

4).  The dollar had fallen sharply immediately before the March FOMC meeting 

and rebounded soon afterward; it has been moving up in recent days.6  In line with 

improvements in market sentiment in the United States, major headline equity 

indexes in Europe and Japan ended the period up 6 to 13 percent on net.  

Financial sector share prices generally rose even more, despite announcements of 

further writedowns by a number of large foreign banks.  Market analysts appeared 

to be focused on earnings reports by several U.S. banks and broker-dealers that 

were seen as reassuring, as well as both actual and planned capital raising at some 

U.S. and foreign banks.  The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada lowered 

their policy interest rates during the intermeeting period by 25 and 50 basis points, 

respectively, while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left their 

policy rates unchanged.  Ten-year nominal sovereign yields were up about 15 to 45 

basis points in the advanced foreign economies.   

(12) The exchange value of the dollar against the currencies of our other 

important trading partners fell about 1 percent over the intermeeting period, as 

readings on both economic activity and financial markets held up reasonably well 

in most Asian and Latin American economies.  Emerging market risk spreads 

generally narrowed and most stock price indexes moved up.  A notable exception 

was China, where, notwithstanding indications of continued strong economic 

growth, the Shanghai equity index dropped 2 percent.

Debt and Money 

(13) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have expanded 

at an annual rate of 5¾ percent in the first quarter, more than 2 percentage points 

below last year’s rate (Chart 5).  Nonfinancial business sector debt decelerated 

again in the first quarter, as growth in both C&I loans and bonds slowed.  In part, 

this slowdown reflects the cooling of mergers and acquisitions and a reduction in 

equity repurchases.  In the household sector, home mortgage debt and consumer 

credit are estimated to have continued their recent slowdowns into the first 

quarter.  Falling house prices are a major factor holding down household credit.  

(14) In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, the net percentages of 

respondents that reported tightening credit standards over the past three months 

increased further, and for the domestic respondents these measures are at or close 

to record levels for most major loan categories.  Nonetheless, commercial bank 

credit grew robustly in March, led by banks’ acquisitions of securities and strength 

in business lending and residential real estate loans.  C&I loans at large banks 

continued to expand smartly, as some nonfinancial firms reportedly drew on 

existing lines of credit.  Consistent with these reports, the Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey indicated that demand for C&I loans has been bolstered by shifts 

from other sources of business credit.  For the first quarter as a whole, bank credit 

expanded at a moderate pace, down notably from the very rapid advance posted in 

the second half of last year. 

(15) M2 expanded at a robust 12½ percent annual rate in March, bringing 

growth for the first quarter to a 9½ percent pace.  Retail money market funds and 

liquid deposits continued to rise rapidly as investors sought safety and liquidity.  In 

addition, growth of liquid deposits was boosted by recent declines in opportunity 

costs.  Currency increased moderately after several quarters of very slow growth, 

but most of this rebound appears to reflect difficulties in seasonal adjustment

owing to an unusually early Easter.  Small time deposits contracted sharply in 

March, the first decline since 2004, and the spreads of rates paid on these deposits 

relative to other deposits narrowed.  These spreads had been somewhat elevated in 

recent months as some institutions had been bidding aggressively for these 

deposits as a funding source. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 38



 

Economic Outlook 

(16) Incoming information has been broadly consistent with the staff’s 

expectations at the time of the March Greenbook.  Consequently, the Greenbook 

projection for both economic activity and inflation is little changed from March.  

The staff forecast continues to be conditioned on the assumption that the target 

federal funds rate is reduced to 2 percent at the April FOMC meeting and to 1¾ 

percent at the June meeting and is then maintained at that level through the end of 

2009.  Long-term Treasury yields edge up through this year and next as the 

influence of the particularly low short-term interest rates expected over this period 

wanes.  Equity prices start from a level about 5 percent higher than anticipated in 

the previous staff forecast but otherwise follow a similar contour, increasing at an 

annual rate of about 7 percent over the remainder of this year, before accelerating 

to a rate of around 11½ percent in 2009 as the equity premium declines toward 

more normal levels.  The trade-weighted dollar is again assumed to depreciate at an 

annual rate of 3 percent over the projection period.  In line with futures quotes, 

the price of WTI crude oil is expected to average around $116 per barrel through 

the remainder of 2008 and $111 per barrel in 2009, about $10 per barrel higher 

than in the previous Greenbook.   

(17) The staff continues to judge that the economy is in recession, with real 

GDP projected to contract at an annual rate of about 1½ percent in the second 

quarter of this year.  Fiscal stimulus and the lagged effects of monetary policy 

easing engender a shallow recovery in the latter half of 2008.  As in the March 

Greenbook, the level of GDP is projected to be almost unchanged over 2008 as a 

whole.  Thereafter, as the functioning of financial markets gradually improves and 

the drag on demand from past increases in oil prices lessens, the recovery gathers 

momentum, with GDP advancing by around 2¾ percent in 2009, about ½ 

percentage point faster than the staff’s estimate of the expansion in the productive 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 38



 

potential of the economy.  As in the March projection, the sub-par economic 

growth over the next few quarters causes the unemployment rate to rise to 5¾ 

percent by the end of this year.  The unemployment rate edges down only slightly 

during 2009 and is still around ¾ of a percentage point above the staff’s estimate 

of the NAIRU at the end of next year.  Total PCE inflation is projected to remain 

elevated through much of this year, boosted by increases in both energy and 

nonfuel import prices.  As in March, the staff’s inflation forecast assumes that the 

public’s long-term inflation expectations have moved up a little since the end of 

last year.  However, the projected leveling-out of oil and other commodity prices, 

combined with an anticipated deceleration in import prices and increasing slack in 

labor and product markets, push headline inflation down to around 1¾ percent in 

2009.  The staff forecast for core PCE inflation follows a broadly similar pattern, 

slowing from an average of 2¼ percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2009.  

(18) The Greenbook forecast has been extended beyond 2009 using the 

FRB/US model with adjustments to ensure consistency with the staff’s assessment 

of longer-run trends.  The extended forecast embeds several key assumptions:  

Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation in the long run at a level of 1¾ 

percent; trend multifactor productivity grows a bit faster than 1 percent per year; 

relative energy prices edge down; the real value of the dollar depreciates steadily at 

about 1 percent per year; and fiscal policy is essentially neutral.  With the 

unemployment rate notably above the NAIRU and core inflation running at about 

2 percent in 2009, these long-run assumptions are consistent with a very gradual 

tightening in monetary policy; the federal funds rate rises from less than 2 percent 

on average in 2010 to 4 percent by the end of 2012.  Policy is nonetheless 

sufficiently accommodative that the unemployment rate declines to 4¾ percent—

the staff’s assessment of the NAIRU—by 2012.  Under the pressure of persistent

7  In conducting these simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by the 
extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information. 

slack, core PCE inflation edges down over time, while headline inflation stays 

close to 1¾ percent. 

Monetary Policy Strategies  

(19) Consistent with the minor revisions to the staff’s outlook for real activity 

and actual and projected financial conditions, the Greenbook-consistent estimate 

of short-run r* is -0.5 percent, essentially unchanged from the March Bluebook 

(Chart 6).  The FRB/US model-based estimate of short-run r* is 0.3 percent, 

which is a bit higher than the current real funds rate.  The estimate of short-run r* 

from the small structural model is -0.8 percent, slightly above the March estimate.  

The single-equation model estimate of short-run r* is about unchanged from the 

previous Bluebook. 

(20) Chart 7 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the long-run Greenbook forecast beyond 2009.  In these simulations, policymakers 

place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal, on 

keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in 

the nominal federal funds rate.7  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand 

set of charts), the simulation prescribes a nominal federal funds rate that declines 

to around 2 percent by the end of next year and then rises toward 4 percent by late 

2012.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the 

optimal funds rate falls more sharply, dipping to near 1 percent by late 2009 before 

rising to about 4¼ percent by 2012.  Under either inflation goal, these 

prescriptions for the funds rate, as well as the associated outcomes for the 

unemployment rate, are little changed from those shown in the previous

Bluebook, consistent with the small revisions to the Greenbook projection.  

However, the very near-term paths for the core inflation rate have been revised 

down because of the transitory effects of the favorable news on non-energy prices 

received since the close of the March Bluebook; core inflation is a touch higher in 

2009, though, as higher oil and import prices this year are projected to add a bit 

more to core prices through much of next year. 

(21) The outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes a funds rate path 

that moves down to 2 percent by the fourth quarter of this year, rises gradually 

throughout 2009, and then stays between 2¾ and 3 percent (Chart 8).  On average 

in 2008, this projection is around 30 basis points lower than the trajectory in the 

March Bluebook, mostly reflecting a lower funds rate at the start of the projection.  

According to financial market quotes, investors anticipate that the funds rate will 

remain around 2¼ percent through the end of this year and then progressively rise 

to slightly above 4 percent by the end of 2012.  This path is slightly higher than in 

the previous Bluebook.  The confidence intervals obtained from stochastic 

simulations of the FRB/US model indicate a substantial probability that the funds 

rate falls below 1 percent within the next few quarters, whereas the probability 

implied by options on interest rate caps is relatively low.  (See box “The 

Likelihood of Reaching Very Low Interest Rates.”)  The near-term prescriptions 

from the simple policy rules proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) are lower than those 

shown in the March Bluebook, but remain well above the current target rate or the 

prescriptions of the estimated outcome-based rule.  These prescriptions are 

relatively high because they do not include any role for policy inertia and do not 

take into account current financial market pressures and other forward-looking 

information captured by market expectations and the staff forecast.

The Likelihood of Reaching Very Low Interest Rates 
 
The staff’s outlook assumes that the federal  
funds rate will fall to 1¾ percent in mid-2008  
and then remain at that level through the  
end of next year.  The discussion in this box  
gauges the likelihood of reaching very low interest 
rates—that is, rates below 1 percent.  Such low  
rates might occur if further policy easing  
were needed to counteract ongoing strains  
in financial markets or other adverse shocks to  
the economy.  The box ends with a discussion 
of the implications of very low interest rates 
for monetary policy strategy.   

The upper panel depicts the recent evolution of  
model-based probabilities that the target funds  
rate will fall below 1 percent at a horizon of  
one year (solid line) or two years (dashed line).  
These probabilities have been computed from  
stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model.   
The stochastic simulations are computed using 
real time data; in particular, the model baseline          
is given by the corresponding vintage of the  
Greenbook outlook.  The shocks are drawn from the Great Moderation period, and 
the path of policy is determined by the empirical outcome-based rule.  These model-
based measures indicate that the probability of reaching very low interest rates has 
risen substantially since last year and now exceeds 20 percent at a one-year horizon 
and 25 percent at a two-year horizon.   

The lower panel depicts market-based probabilities derived from options on 
Eurodollar futures contracts.  Evidently, financial market participants perceived  
the likelihood of very low interest rates to be negligible over the second half of 2007; 
by late February, however, investors saw odds of about 1 in 3 that the target funds 
rate would be below 1 percent at the end of this year, but odds of only 1 in 10 that the 
funds rate would be that low a year later.  In recent weeks, these market-based 
probabilities have fallen back to very low levels, partly because investors appeared to 
reduce the odds on an adverse tail event in the near future.   

Very low interest rates pose challenges for policy makers, partly because of 
uncertainty about the efficacy of unconventional policy tools that might be employed 
if further reductions in the federal funds rate became infeasible because of the zero 
bound.

If policymakers perceive a substantial probability of further weakness in aggregate  
demand sufficient to call for a very low target funds rate in coming quarters, then  
existing research would prescribe policy adjustment that is more aggressive than usual  
to provide insurance against the risk of a protracted recession.1  However, in contrast 
to the policy situation in 2003, the current rate of expected inflation is somewhat 
elevated.  This observation may give policymakers some comfort that they can 
provide considerable stimulus to real activity if needed through very low real short-
term interest rates and so do not need to act more aggressively.  Moreover, if 
policymakers place relatively low odds on a very low funds rate, then a shift to more 
aggressive policy adjustment may be less compelling.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would 

reduce the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1¾ percent, under 

Alternative B the federal funds rate target would be cut by 25 basis points to 2 

percent, and under Alternative C the Committee would maintain the federal funds 

rate target at 2¼ percent.  In contrast to the FOMC statement in March, the risk 

assessments in Alternatives A and B no longer emphasize the downside risks to 

growth and so convey a more neutral policy stance.  Alternative B indicates that 

the pace of interest rate reductions may need to slow in order for the Committee 

to assess better the effects of policy actions taken to date, whereas Alternative A 

reiterates that the Committee stands ready to act in a timely manner.  Alternative C 

retains the judgment that downside risks to growth remain and explains that the 

Committee’s decision to pause at this meeting was to allow more time to assess the 

effects of past policy actions.  As usual, the Committee could formulate its 

statement using language from more than one alternative.  Table 1 may need to be 

modified once participants have submitted their economic projections in order to 

ensure that the draft statements are consistent with the projections and the 

accompanying narratives.  

(23) If the Committee judges that the target funds rate is nearing a level that 

would appropriately balance the risks to its dual objectives of fostering maximum 

employment and price stability, it may wish to reduce the target federal funds rate 

by 25 basis points, as in Alternative B, a relatively modest action compared with 

those taken over the past several months.  Members may view the incoming data 

as broadly consistent with their earlier assessments concerning the underlying 

weakness of economic activity and the likely need for further monetary stimulus at 

this meeting to promote a timely resumption of moderate economic growth.

weakened further.  Growth in consumer 
spending has slowed and labor markets 
have softened.  Financial markets 
remain under considerable stress, and 
the tightening of credit conditions and 
the deepening of the housing 
contraction are likely to weigh on 
economic growth over the next few 
quarters.

risen.  The Committee expects inflation 
to moderate in coming quarters, 
reflecting a projected leveling-out of 
energy and other commodity prices and 
an easing of pressures on resource 
utilization.  Still, uncertainty about the 
inflation outlook has increased.  It will 
be necessary to continue to monitor 
inflation developments carefully.

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. Today’s policy action, combined with 
those taken earlier, including measures 
to foster market liquidity, should help to 
promote moderate growth over time 
and to mitigate the risks to economic 
activity.  However, downside risks to 
growth remain.  The Committee will act 
in a timely manner as needed to 
promote sustainable economic growth 
and price stability. 

The Committee judged that a further 
reduction in interest rates was 
appropriate to foster moderate growth 
over time and to mitigate the risks to 
economic activity.  The Committee 
will act in a timely manner as needed 
to promote sustainable economic 
growth and price stability.

sustainable economic growth and price 
stability.

Indeed, the Greenbook-consistent measure of the equilibrium funds rate is about 

½ percentage point below the Bluebook estimate of the current real funds rate, 

suggesting that policy likely still needs to be eased fairly significantly in order to 

bring output back to its potential over the medium term.  However, the 

Committee may view the calibration of the appropriate level of the funds rate as 

particularly problematic given the difficulty of assessing the effects of the 

substantial easing of policy to date and the myriad uncertainties surrounding the 

outlook for output and inflation.  In light of this difficulty and with the gap 

between the real federal funds rate and its equilibrium rate now estimated to have 

narrowed, members may prefer to adjust policy more gradually than hitherto.  The 

deterioration in the near-term outlook for inflation over recent months may also 

be viewed as supporting the adoption of a more incremental approach.  In 

particular, members might be concerned that a more aggressive policy easing at 

this meeting would encourage a perception that the Committee has a greater 

tolerance for inflation than previously thought, with the potential for adverse 

effects on longer-term inflation expectations.  Members might also worry that 

another substantial reduction in the funds rate would increase the likelihood of a 

steep decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar or possibly even a further 

run-up in commodity prices, developments that would put additional upward 

pressure on inflation.   

(24) The discussion of the outlook for economic activity and inflation in the 

proposed statement accompanying Alternative B is little changed from the March 

FOMC statement.  The characterization of the real economy has been amended to 

note that recent information indicates that economic activity “remains weak” in 

contrast to the March statement in which the outlook for economic activity was 

judged to have “weakened further.”  Similarly, in light of the mixed developments 

in financial markets, credit conditions are described as “tight” as opposed to the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 38



 

“tightening” highlighted in March.  The paragraph about inflation is essentially 

unaltered from the previous statement, save for some modest adjustments to the 

references to the apparent rise in inflation expectations and to the increase in the 

uncertainty attending the inflation outlook in order to avoid giving the impression 

that either of these concerns has escalated over the intermeeting period.  Even 

though the economic outlook has not changed materially, the draft risk assessment 

notes that the “Committee judged that a further reduction in interest rates was 

appropriate to foster moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to 

economic activity.”  In contrast to the March statement, the risk assessment no 

longer highlights the downside risks to growth and thus implies that policy has 

moved to a more neutral stance.  The proposed risk assessment also indicates that 

“some time may be needed to better assess the effects of the policy actions taken 

to date.”  As such, the statement is likely to be interpreted as suggesting that policy 

may be on hold for a while.  Nonetheless, the statement concludes by noting that 

the Committee “remains prepared” to act as needed to promote economic growth 

and price stability.  

(25)  Alternative B would likely be viewed by market participants as being 

broadly consistent with their expectations.  Investors’ modal expectation as 

implied by financial futures and options prices appears to be for a 25 basis point 

easing at this meeting and for the target funds rate to be maintained at 2 percent at 

the June meeting.  Taken at face value, these financial market quotes suggest that 

the reaction of financial asset prices to Alternative B is likely to be relatively 

muted.  However, respondents to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers expected a 

notably lower path for the federal funds rate than that implied by futures prices, 

and this divergence makes the reaction to Alternative B somewhat harder to 

predict. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 29 of 38



 

(26) If the Committee believes that the substantial easing of monetary 

policy to date together with the fiscal stimulus package is likely to provide 

considerable support to economic activity and is concerned that inflation might 

not moderate at an acceptable pace, it may prefer to keep rates unchanged at this 

meeting, as in Alternative C.  With the real federal funds rate close to historically 

low levels, the Committee may anticipate that the economy will avoid a 

pronounced downturn.  The Committee may not view the incoming data as 

suggesting the sort of broad weakening in spending that the staff expects as a 

result of the economy shifting to a “recessionary state,” and hence may put some 

weight on the “Near-Term Upside Risk” scenario in the Greenbook.  Members 

might also be worried that inflation may follow a higher trajectory than in the staff 

forecast.  Energy and commodity prices have repeatedly surprised to the upside in 

recent years and members might attach some likelihood to this pattern continuing, 

as illustrated in the “Greater Inflationary Pressure” scenario in the Greenbook.  

Moreover, members might feel that the pass-through of past cost increases into 

retail prices could be greater than anticipated by the staff.  In addition, some 

indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months and members 

might worry that long-term inflation expectations could drift up further if inflation 

remains around its current elevated level, a development that would be costly to 

reverse.  In that regard, members might be troubled that core PCE inflation has 

averaged more than 2 percent in every year since 2004 and is forecast by the staff 

to do so again in 2008.  In a similar vein, members might be concerned that the 

apparent deterioration in inflation expectations could cause inflation to settle at an 

unacceptably high level once economic activity returns to more normal level and 

the downward contribution to inflation from the projected slack in resource 

markets dissipates.  These considerations might suggest that the Committee stay its 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 38



 

hand at this meeting in order to allow more information to accumulate on 

prospects for both growth and inflation. 

(27) The discussion of economic activity in the proposed statement for 

Alternative C is identical to that in the statement suggested for Alternative B.  

And, as in Alternative B, the draft inflation paragraph continues to indicate that 

inflation seems likely to moderate in coming quarters.  However, in contrast to the 

FOMC statement in March, the factors expected to contribute to that moderation 

are not explicitly identified in order to emphasize the uncertainty attending the 

Committee’s outlook for inflation.  The proposed risk assessment notes that 

although “downside risks to growth remain,” the Committee judged that “more 

time is needed to better assess economic prospects and the effects of the policy 

actions taken to date,” thereby explaining why the stance of policy was left 

unchanged at this meeting.  Although the statement concludes by reiterating that 

the Committee will act “as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and 

price stability,” market participants may see the statement as suggesting that the 

pause in policy actions could continue for a while. 

(28) Alternative C would come as a surprise to market participants, who 

appear fairly confident that the funds rate target will be cut by at least 25 basis 

points at this meeting.  This surprise would be compounded if the accompanying 

statement is interpreted as suggesting that policy may remain on hold over the next 

few meetings.  Investors would likely mark up their expectations for the path of 

policy over the next few quarters, leading to an increase in short- and intermediate-

term interest rates.  Pressures in short-term funding markets could worsen.  Long-

term nominal Treasury yields would rise by less or could even fall if the 

Committee’s decision caused investors to revise down their expected trajectory of 

future inflation.  With real rates higher, equities would probably fall, credit spreads 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 31 of 38



 

on corporate debt might widen, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might 

be expected to rise.  

(29) In contrast, if the Committee continues to view the outlook for 

economic activity as unacceptably weak, it may prefer to reduce the target funds 

rate by 50 basis points at this meeting, as proposed in Alternative A.  The 

Committee might judge that financial headwinds could continue to exert a 

significant drag on economic growth through much of next year and thus policy 

may eventually have to be eased by more than envisaged by the staff, a possibility 

explored in the “Greater Financial Stress” scenario in the Greenbook.  

Alternatively, the Committee might share the staff’s assessment of the underlying 

forces shaping the economy and the probable extent to which policy will need to 

be eased in order to foster a return to more normal levels of activity, but judge that 

the downside risks to growth are such that it is preferable to adjust rates more 

promptly than suggested by the staff forecast.  In particular, the Committee might 

feel that an adverse feedback loop—in which weakness in the real economy 

exacerbates strains in financial markets which in turn feed back onto economic 

activity—remains a distinct possibility and that it is prudent for policy to respond 

decisively to reduce the risk of this dynamic taking hold.  In this case, members 

might be willing to tolerate the likelihood of a somewhat higher path for inflation 

than in the staff forecast in order to respond more aggressively to the possibility of 

significant weakness in output.  In that regard, the optimal-control simulation with 

an inflation goal of 2 percent prescribes a trajectory for the target funds rate that 

drops close to 1 percent by the end of 2009, notably softer than the policy path 

assumed in the Greenbook.   

(30) The discussion of the outlook for economic activity and inflation in the 

draft statement accompanying Alternative A is identical to that proposed for 

Alternative B.  The draft risk assessment also follows Alternative B in omitting the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 32 of 38



 

judgment from the March FOMC statement that “downside risks to growth 

remain,” and so indicates that policy has moved to a more neutral stance.  The 

statement concludes by reiterating that the Committee “will act in a timely 

manner” to promote economic growth and price stability. 

(31) With investors attaching little weight to the possibility of a 50 basis point 

cut in the target funds rate at this meeting, Alternative A would come as a 

considerable surprise to financial markets.  Short- and intermediate-term interest 

rates would move lower.  Long-term nominal Treasury yields and measures of 

inflation compensation could increase if the Committee’s action was interpreted as 

implying that it was willing to tolerate a higher trajectory for inflation than 

investors had previously thought.  Equity prices would probably rise and the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar could weaken further.  However, these 

responses would be damped somewhat to the extent that the accompanying 

statement was read as suggesting that the Committee was not inclined to ease rates 

further after this meeting.    

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(32) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is expected to grow around 9½ 

percent this year, significantly faster than the projected expansion of nominal 

GDP.  The resulting decline in the velocity of M2 is largely due to a substantial fall 

in the opportunity cost of M2 assets that reflects the easing of monetary policy.  

Growth of M2 is also likely to be boosted by a further shift in the composition of 

households’ portfolios towards safe and liquid monetary assets in response to the 

ongoing financial turmoil.  The expansion of M2 is expected to slow to around 5½ 

percent in 2009, reflecting the anticipated leveling-off in the opportunity cost of 

M2 assets and the return to more-normal financial market conditions.

(33) After advancing at an annual rate of around 8 percent in 2007, the 

growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to slow to around 4½ 

percent in 2008 and to remain around that pace in 2009.  The deceleration reflects 

a broad-based slowdown in borrowing by households, nonfinancial businesses, 

and state and local governments.  In the household sector, the ongoing weakness 

in housing market activity and prices is expected to weigh on mortgage borrowing 

through this year and next.  Similarly, advances in consumer credit are likely to 

remain relatively subdued given sluggish gains in household spending on durables 

and tighter standards and terms on consumer loans.  The slowing in business 

borrowing is consistent with the sharp tailing-off in M&A and share repurchase 

activity.  State and local government borrowing has decelerated in response to a 

drop in issuance for long-term capital projects and advance refunding.  In addition, 

the ongoing difficulties of major bond insurers are likely to restrain municipal 

bond issuance somewhat this year.  In contrast, the growth of federal debt is 

expected to pick up to around 7½ percent in 2008, boosted in part by borrowing 

to fund the economic stimulus package.

AT/to an average of around ________ 2¼ percent. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 36 of 38



Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

 

 

  

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

 

 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( y y *t t−  and y y *t t+ +1| − t 1|t ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (Δ −4 4y y *t t+ +3| Δ t 3|t ), and π *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule with a higher 
value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions regarding r* or 
the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
