through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Deposit data now available for all of November indicate that

growth in the narrowly-defined money supply was substantially stronger in

the month than indicated either by the estimate based on partial data

shown in the greenbook or by the preliminary week-by-week figures available

to the Trading Desk in late November and early December. According to the

latest estimates, the money supply grew at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate in

November, and its level was above the monthly figure consistent with a 4 per

cent growth rate for the fourth quarter. The final money supply figure

for October, while showing very little growth on average for the month,

was also a bit above the initial estimate available at the last Committee

meeting. A factor contributing to the larger-than-expected money supply

growth recently may have been a bulge in transactions demand stemming from

enlarged bond and stock market activity.

(2) The bank credit proxy in November also ran a little above

earlier projections, and the gap widened in early December. In addition

to private demand deposits, U.S. Government deposits are larger than

expected, reflecting sales of special securities to foreign official

holders. Banks have continued to substitute time deposits for commercial

paper and, until very recently, for Euro-dollars. Since the Board's

December 1 announcement of regulatory actions affecting the opportunity



cost of obtaining such funds, Euro-dollar borrowings have increased somewhat,

although some of the increase may be seasonal.

(3) The following table shows recent developments in the money

supply and the adjusted credit proxy.

(4) During the period since the mid-November Committee meeting,

the Federal funds rate was moved down into a 5--5-1/2 per cent range, in

the interest of promoting desired growth in the money supply. Most

recently, Federal funds have been trading at the lower end of the indicated

range, occasionally even dipping below, despite sizable Desk reserve

absorbing operations. Member bank borrowings averaged $370 million in

the past two statement weeks, not much above minimal levels, and about

$60 million below the October-November average. Net borrowed reserves

averaged around $100 million in the past two statement weeks, about $130

million below the October-November average,

(5) The downtrend of market interest rates, begun earlier in

the quarter, was sharply extended during the inter-meeting period, with

yield declines in some short-term markets ranging to as much as another

3/4 of a percentage point, and those in long-term markets generally 1/2

to 5/8 percentage point. Further reductions in the prime rate and the

discount rate, continued weakness in the economy, and anticipations of

still further easing of monetary policy contributed to these declines.

In the Treasury bill market, the key 3-month issue was most recently quoted

around 4.85 per cent, about 40 basis points below its level at the time

of the Committee meeting. The decline in long-term market yields occurred

despite the very heavy calendars of new corporate and municipal bond

offerings. Desk buying of nearly $300 million of Treasury coupon issues

over the period contributed marginally to the declines in long-term rates.

(6) The following table summarizes seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change in major financial aggregates for selected periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Given recent developments, and with a Federal funds

rate generally in a 5--5-1/4 per cent range, it appears that the money

supply may grow at around a 9 per cent annual rate in December, and at

about a 5 per cent annual rate for the fourth quarter. As to the

adjusted bank credit proxy, it may be expected to expand at about a

17 per cent annual rate this month, and by around 8-1/2 per cent over

the fourth quarter. The more rapid growth of the credit proxy in

December, as compared with October-November, reflects not only greater

expansion in private demand deposits but also larger inflows of U.S.

Government and time deposits. Banks have issued a sizable amount of

large CD's in recent weeks, in part to acquire securities at a time of

declining interest rate expectations and partly in anticipation of

seasonal CD run-offs in the latter part of December.

(8) Against the background of a 5 per cent growth rate for

money supply over the fourth quarter, the table on the following page

shows three alternative growth paths for money, bank credit, and total

reserves for the first quarter. Alternative A involves a 5 per cent

money growth rate; alternative B, 6 per cent; and alternative C, 7 per

cent. The last section of the text (paragraphs 14 through 19) discusses

possible directive language for various policy courses.

(9) The bank credit proxy figures shown in the table assume,

for alternatives A and B, no further decline in Euro-dollar borrowings

from recent levels. This neutral assumption seems to be about the best

we can make, given uncertainties as to the ultimate pattern of bank

response to recent Board actions and as to the likely changes in the

recent substantial differentials in costs of Euro-dollars as against

domestic funds. Even under these alternatives, it should be recognized

that a resumption of decline in Euro-dollar borrowings is a real possi-

bility. Under alternative C, declining market interest rates would

very likely encourage some further shift away from Euro-dollar borrow-

ings absent additional Board action. Outstanding bank-related commercial

paper is expected to continue declining, though at a slower pace. In

general, growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's may

be dampened as post-strike auto sales tend to impinge on the personal

saving rate. Under alternative A, such growth is projected to be a

little less in the first quarter than in the fourth, but under alterna-

tives B and C, time deposits are assumed to grow somewhat more rapidly

because market interest rates would be relatively lower. Bank interest

in large CD's is likely to be fairly strong, as they continue to want

to acquire market securities and as business loan demand picks up.

(10) The range of money market conditions, as typified by

the Federal funds rate, that would be expected to be consistent over

the next few weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are

summarized below.
Annual rates of increase

in money supply
Federal funds rate 4th Qtr. 1st Qtr.

Alternative A 5--5-1/2 5% 5%

B 4-5/8--5-1/8 5% 67.

C 4-1/4--4-3/4 5% 77



Weekly figures for the aggregates between now and the next FOMC meeting

consistent with these paths are shown in the table on page 9.

(11) In the case of alternative A, the Federal funds range

is wide enough to allow for some tightening from recent levels. This

may be required to limit money growth in the first quarter to 5 per

cent should the Greenbook projection of a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate

of growth in nominal GNP in the first quarter be realized. Since the

last meeting of the Committee, the demand for money has proven to be

somewhat stronger, at given Federal funds rates, than the staff antici-

pated. This greater demand may have been temporary, however, resulting

from a sudden surge in financial market transactions, as noted earlier.

Because of uncertainties as to the source of recent money demand and as

to transactions needs associated with such a large bulge in prospective

GNP growth, a fairly wide Federal funds rate range is also shown for

alternatives B and C. If demand for money at given Federal funds rates

continues to be greater than anticipated--as a result of financial

transactions or the need to finance a temporary large post-strike bulge

in GNP--the Committee may be faced with the possibility of either per-

mitting the Federal funds rate to rise above the ranges shown in

paragraph (10) for any particular alternative chosen, or permitting,

at least temporarily, a higher money growth rate than contemplated.

(12) Between now and the next Committee meeting (mid-

January), the 3-month Treasury bill rate may move through intervals

of both downward and upward pressure, in response to a succession of

seasonal and post auto-strike influences. Consequently, the yield

may fluctuate in a 4-1/2--5 per cent range, assuming the Federal funds

rate stays around 5--5-1/8 per cent and the net reserve position of banks

is mostly on the negative side, with borrowings at minimal levels (apart

from necessitous borrowing of two banks). If the Federal funds rate

were to move above this range--for example, in order to restrain money

supply growth--an appreciable rise in the 3-month bill rate might

develop; the bill rate might move back up to around 5-1/4 per cent, and

the downward tendency of other interest rates might well be reversed.

If, on the other hand, the Federal funds rate were to be persistently

below 5 per cent, the bill rate might move toward the lower end of, or

even below, the range shown, particularly in view of the absence of a

Treasury cash financing in January. A declining bill rate would likely

be accompanied by some downdrift in other short-term rates, although

yield spreads of other short rates over the bill rate have narrowed

since early November. Any further downdrift in short rates would

intensify pressures for a further reduction in the prime rate.

(13) Long-term interest rates may move downward somewhat

further even in the absence of short-term rate declines, reflecting a

seasonal pick-up in long-term fund flows after year-end and some

moderation in the supply of securities coming to market. There will

be the usual lull in new corporate and municipal issues between now

and the turn of the year; although sizable offerings seem likely in

January, the volume in prospect appears to be somewhat below recent

months. Agency offerings are likely to diminish further in view of

the greater availability of credit at private financial institutions.



-11-

The next Treasury financing--its mid-February refunding--will not be

announced until January 20, shortly after the mid-January FOMC meeting.

No significant amounts of new cash are likely to be raised by the Treasury

until around the time of this refunding and then again in March. Under

the circumstances, if short-term interest rates do show a sustained

downward tendency in the period immediately ahead, a considerable rally

in bond markets may again develop.

Possible directive language

(14) This section presents possible language for the second

paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses

discussed above, as well as a fourth possibility involving renewal of

the present directive language.

(15) Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides upon a 5 per cent target growth rate for the

money supply in the first quarter:

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

[DEL: some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth

in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months

ahead with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit

demands related to the auto strike.] System open market opera-

tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted

with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market con-

ditions consistent with those objectives.



-12-

Deletion of the phrase "some easing of conditions in credit markets" is

proposed in light of the analysis in paragraphs (10) and (11) above

suggesting that some rise in the Federal funds rate might be required as

the quarter progresses to keep the money supply growth rate from exceed-

ing 5 per cent. While some rise in the Federal funds rate would not

necessarily be inconsistent with continued declines in long-term rates,

particularly if over-all credit demands slacken, it is assumed that the

Committee would not want to indicate that it was seeking "to promote"

some easing of credit market conditions under a policy course that

contemplates the possibility of some firming of money market conditions.

(16) As indicated, it is also proposed to delete the clause

"with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit demands related

to the auto strike." This clause had been included in the previous

directive to reflect the Committee's willingness, for reasons related

to the auto strike, to accept money growth rates in the fourth and first

quarters that were, respectively, below and above its longer-run target

rate. At present, however, if the Committee adopts this alternative

its target for the first quarter presumably will not exceed its target

for the longer run. (For the same reason, deletion of the clause in

question is proposed in the two following alternatives also.)

(17) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for

possible use if the Committee decides to set its target for money at

the 6 per cent rate indicated by the revised data to have prevailed

in the three quarters before the auto strike:



-13-

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth

in money [DEL:and attendant bank credit expansion over the months

ahead AT ABOUT THE AVERAGE RATE PREVAILING IN THE FIRST THREE

QUARTERS OF 1970, with ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION allowance

for temporary shifts in money and credit demands related to the

auto strike.] System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-

taining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent

with those objectives.

(8) Alternative C. This alternative is suggested for

possible use if the Committee decides to step up its target growth

rate for money to 7 per cent:

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate

SOMEWHAT MORE RAPID growth in money [DEL: and attendant bank credit

expansion over the months ahead THAN PREVAILED IN THE FIRST

THREE QUARTERS OF 1970, with ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION

allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit demands

related to the auto strike.] System open market operations

until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted

with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market

conditions consistent with those objectives.

Deletion of the word "some" from the statement that "the Committee

seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets" is



-14-

suggested because of the greater degree of credit market easing likely

to ensue under this policy course.

(19) Alternative D. There remains the possibility that, in

light of the expected first-quarter surge in nominal GNP in the aftermath

of the auto strike, the Committee may wish to accept a temporarily

higher money growth rate during the first quarter than it would contemplate

at this time for the longer run. To articulate such a policy, the

Committee could decide simply to renew the second paragraph of the

existing directive without change:

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth

in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months

ahead, with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit

demands related to the auto strike. System open market operations

until the bext meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a

view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions

consistent with those objectives.

If the Committee adopts this alternative it could instruct the Manager to

maintain essentially prevailing money market conditions--as typified

by a Federal funds rate of 5 to 5-1/4 per cent--so long as the money

supply in the weeks ahead appears to be on a path consistant with growth

in the first quarter at an annual rate in a range between, say, 5 and 7

per cent.
