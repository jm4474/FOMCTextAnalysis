Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1 increased at about an 8 percent annual rate from June

to September, and M2 by about 9-3/4 percent. The Committee's targets for

the period were 5 and 9 percent, respectively, but somewhat more growth

was considered to be acceptable depending on whether economic and financial

uncertainties seemed to be increasing liquidity demands and affecting

financial asset preferences.

(2) Expansion of M1 was strong in August and September, when

NOW accounts grew quite rapidly, in part reflecting the early impact of the

tax cut as well as precautionary behavior as the economy remained unexpectedly

sluggish. The reduced level of short-term market rates has considerably de-

creased the earnings disadvantage to keeping funds in NOW accounts. Demand

deposits also grew rather rapidly in September, perhaps partly in response

to increased securities markets activity and possibly to some increase in

compensating balances as the earnings value to banks of corporate deposits

declined.

(3) Following a very rapid expansion in August, M2 increased at

only a 5-1/4 percent annual rate in September, as growth in the nontrans-

action component decelerated unusually rapidly. Money market fund growth

slowed as their yields declined in lagged reaction to earlier reductions

in market rates. Growth in the total of small time and savings deposits

also slowed sharply. Thus, it would appear that some funds may have been

shifted out of M2 into market securities.

(4) Bank credit grew at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in August,

and partial data for September indicate that growth has slowed somewhat

further. This may reflect reduced demands for short-term credit as well

as, possibly, a degree of cautious behavior on the part of at least some

large banks in view of current economic and financial difficulties. Out-

standing large time deposits of banks contracted in September, on average,

the first such decline in almost a year. Business loan growth slowed

sharply in August, but appears to have picked up in the early weeks of

September, reflecting takedowns of loans related to recent merger activity.

Other forms of short-term borrowing by nonfinancial business have also been

weak; the volume of commercial paper outstanding edged down in August and

dropped further in September. In part the weakness in short-term borrowing

reflected a pick-up in bond market financing by nonfinancial businesses.

(5) Total reserves expanded at about a 9 percent annual rate in

August but growth accelerated to about a 23 percent annual rate in September

when expansion in M1 rose considerably above the 5 percent June-September

path. A little less than half of the growth in total reserves last month

was supplied by nonborrowed reserves. The increase in adjustment borrowing

in September stemmed partly from temporary borrowing related to special bank

funding problems (which was offset by reduced nonborrowed reserves) and

partly from the strength in M1 (though the implied rise in borrowing was

limited so as to be accommodative to some of the apparent increase in

liquidity demands).1/

(6) The federal funds rate has moved into a trading range generally

somewhat above the 10 percent discount rate, up from the 9 percent area that

had emerged in the market around the time of the August FOMC meeting when

expectations of continued declines in short-term rates were strong. The

1/ See Appendix I for intermeeting reserve path adjustments.



discount rate was lowered by 1/2 point to 10 percent shortly after the

meeting, but market expectations of further easing in money market condi-

tions dissipated with continued strength of the money supply. The short-

term rate structure generally came under upward pressure, but this was

reflected entirely in yields on private instruments, as market demand for

Treasury securities was intensified by heightened concerns about credit

quality. Long-term market interest rates have continued to trend down

since late August, with Treasury, corporate, and municipal rates dropping

1/4 to 3/4 of a percentage point. In the mortgage markets, the rate on

conventional fixed rate commitments has dropped about 1 percentage point

in typical lagged response to the decline in bond rates.

(7) The dollar has risen by about 3-1/2 percent on a weighted

average basis since the last Committee meeting, reaching a 13-year high.

Although the U.S. private short-term interest rates have backed up since

late August, while foreign interest rates have continued to edge down,

such a change in interest differentials may have been a less important

factor in the increased demand for dollar assets than worldwide political

and financial strains.



Alternative near-term targets

(8) The table below presents three alternative targets for M1

and M2 for the fourth quarter of 1982 and associated intermeeting ranges

for the federal funds rate. More detailed data for the alternatives are

shown in the table and charts on the next few pages. The quarterly

interest rate path underlying the staff's GNP projection is contained

in Appendix II.

Growth from September
to December

M1 5 2½ 0
M2 9½ 8½ 7½

Federal funds rate
range 7 to 11 8 to 12 9 to 13

(9) All of the alternatives imply a slowing of M1 and M2 growth

over the last three months of the year from their summer pace; however,

they generally also imply some overshoot of the FOMC's annual targets.

Alternative C would achieve the upper limit of the Committee's 2-1/2 to

5-1/2 percent longer-run M1 range for 1982, while the growth rates of

alternatives B and A would lead to overshoots in the 1/2 to 1 percentage

point range. Under all alternatives, M2 would remain above the upper end

of its 6 to 9 percent longer-run range.

(10) Alternative B, which calls for M1 growth from September to

December at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate, appears consistent with the federal

funds rate over the intermeeting period continuing on average to be a

little above the current discount rate, and with little net change in other

short-term rates. Total reserves under this alternative would expand at a

5 percent annual rate over the fourth quarter. Borrowing from the Federal

Reserve would be around $450 million, and nonborrowed reserves would expand

at about a 9 percent annual rate.

(11) The moderation in month-by-month M1 growth under this

alternative assumes that the rapid build-up of NOW accounts of the past

two months slows as households adjust financial asset holdings and spend-

1/
ing with a lag to the recent tax cut.1/ We have also assumed that the

unusually rapid rise in demand deposits of late summer will abate and soon

resume the downward trend of earlier this year. Even with a slowing in M1

growth to the 2-1/2 percent annual rate contemplated for the last three

months of the year, growth in the fourth quarter on a quarterly average

basis would be at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate, about the same as the pro-

jected growth in nominal GNP.

(12) Growth of M2 would also be at a relatively moderate 8-1/2

percent pace under alternative B over the last three months of the year.

Expansion in the nontransactions component of M2 may speed up from September,

but is likely to remain below the very rapid pace of July and August. Money

market fund growth should remain slow, and some part of the sizable volume

of ASCs maturing in October might shift to market instruments, particularly

municipals, though the staff believes that the bulk will be either rolled

2/
over or otherwise remain in M2.

1/ No allowance has been made for the effects of legislation requiring DIDC
to establish a ceilingless account for depository institutions that is
competitive with money market mutual funds. This account must be made
available to the public 60 days after date of enactment. When it be-
comes available, possibly in early December, the new instrument is likely
to have a substantial impact on M1 and on the composition and possibly
the total of M2, depending on the exact character of the account or
accounts authorized by DIDC.

2/ A bulge in M1 related to ASCs cannot be ruled out for the first week of
October, when certificates with a maturity value of $25 billion come due.
Some of the proceeds of maturing ASCs could be temporarily placed in de-
mand deposits or NOW accounts in the process of being reinvested or used
to support consumption.



-8-

(13) Bond rates are likely to remain near current levels under

alternative B, and could even decline a bit further if investors continue

to see little, if any, sign of an economic recovery. Despite the further

reduction in deposit costs at S&Ls and MSBs--as higher-cost deposits are

rolled over--thrift hesitancy to commit funds and a leveling off of bond

rates is likely to keep mortgage rates from falling much below 15 percent.

(14) The growth of credit extended to all domestic nonfinancial

borrowers, including the Treasury, is expected to slow in the fourth quarter

from the third-quarter pace. However, this slowing does not reflect a

lessening of credit market pressures. The federal deficit in the current

quarter is expected to be slightly larger (seasonally adjusted) than in the

third. In the third quarter, the Treasury had borrowed heavily but also

had made some of these funds available to the market by adding substantially

to its assets in the form of cash balances. The fourth-quarter deficit

will be financed in part by liquidation of these assets as well as by further

borrowing. Flows of credit to private domestic nonfinancial sectors in

the fourth quarter are projected to remain close to the pace of the third

quarter, with the indebtedness of these sectors increasing at a 6-1/2

percent annual rate, about in line with projected GNP growth. Aggregate

business borrowing should moderate as external financing needs decline

with weakness in investment expenditures, but household credit usage is

likely to rise a little as housing and consumer durable purchases increase

somewhat in lagged response to the July tax cut and recent declines in

interest rates. For the third and fourth quarters together, credit raised

by all domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at a 9-1/2

percent annual rate, up from 8-1/2 percent in the first half of the year,

with increased borrowing by the Treasury more than accounting for the pickup

in the total.



(15) Alternative C calls for virtually no further growth in M1

from September to December, which would achieve the upper limit of the

FOMC's annual target for that aggregate. Total reserves would be expected

to expand at a 2 percent rate over the fourth quarter. Such reserve and

money growth would probably involve a federal funds rate moving rather

promptly into the 11 to 11-1/2 percent area. Assuming no change in the

discount rate, borrowing would likely be around $1 billion and nonborrowed

reserves would show little net change.

(16) The firming of the federal funds rate contemplated by this

alternative would probably cause quite a sharp reaction in short-term mar-

kets, particularly given present market concerns about the condition of

financial institutions and businesses. Private short-term rates may rise

substantially, accompanied by a smaller rise in Treasury bill rates. Bond

yields also would probably also come under considerable upward pressure

for a short while. However, such pressures would be likely to dissipate

over time as a tightening in money markets would tend to reduce expectations

of a business recovery next year and of inflation. A considerable further

strengthening of the dollar on exchange markets might develop, particularly

if money market rates abroad continue to ease.

(17) Alternative A, which targets M1 growth at a 5 percent and

M2 at a 9-1/2 percent annual rate from September to December, would probably

accommodate an easing in money market conditions over the months ahead.

The funds rate might fall to around 9 to 9-1/2 percent, with total reserves

rising at an 8 percent annual rate during the final three months of the

year. At the current discount rate, adjustment (plus seasonal) borrowing



-10-

would fall to frictional levels of $150 million or less, and nonborrowed

reserves would expand at a 15 percent annual rate. The market would come

to expect a further drop in the discount rate.

(18) In such an environment, substantial reductions in short-

term interest rates are likely, with the 3-month bill rate falling to

around 6-1/2 to 7 percent. The easing of money market conditions may

also improve investor attitudes toward private market instruments, parti-

cularly bank CDs, as the over-all economic and financial outlook is viewed

more favorably. Spreads between large CDs and bill rates will probably

narrow, but still remain historically high. With bank costs of funds and

other short-rates declining, there would be strong downward pressure on

the bank prime rate, with that rate perhaps declining to 12 percent or

somewhat lower. Reductions in bond rates could be appreciable if the

further decrease in returns on short-term investments brings more investors

into the long-term market in an effort to lock in relatively high yields.



-11-

Directive language

(19) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for

the directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on August 24 are

shown in strike-through form. The language in brackets, which indicates

that a shortfall in growth would be acceptable in the context of declining

interest rates, is suggested for consideration if the Committee were to

opt for alternative A, the most expansive alternative, although it may also

be useful for alternative B. This language would convey the Committee's

desire to have growth of money for the year closer to the longer-run

target should that turn out to be feasible.

In the short run, the Committee [DEL: continues to seek] SEEKS

behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2

from [DEL: June to] September TO DECEMBER at annual rates of about [DEL: 5] ____

percent and about 9 ___ percent respectively. [DEL: Somewhat-more-rapid

growth would be acceptable depending on evidence that economic and

financial uncertainties are leading to exceptional liquidity

demands and changes in financial asset holdings.] [A SHORTFALL IN

GROWTH OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES FROM THESE RATES WOULD BE

ACCEPTABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF DECLINING INTEREST RATES.] The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and

related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently out-

side a range of [DEL: 7] ____ to [DEL: 11] ____ percent.
