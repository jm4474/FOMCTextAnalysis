MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Immediately after the Committee meeting on November 15,

the System announced a 3/4 percentage point increase in the discount

rate, from 4 to 4-3/4 percent, that was passed through fully to re-

serve market conditions.2 Market participants, who almost univer-

sally.expected a policy action, were nevertheless surprised at the

extent of the tightening, and other money market interest rates firmed

a bit as a result. Major commercial banks raised the prime rate 3/4

percentage point, to 8-1/2 percent. Perhaps because the Committee's

action lent some assurance that the Federal Reserve was determined to

contain inflation, rates further out the Treasury yield curve increas-

ed only a few basis points, at most, and the rate on the thirty-year

bond actually fell that day.

(2) In subsequent weeks, the Treasury yield curve flattened

further. Data releases on economic activity were on the firm side of

expectations and tended to strengthen the notions that the economy

retained considerable buoyancy and that more policy restraint than was

previously anticipated would be forthcoming. By December 5, short-

term interest rates had risen 1/2 percentage point from levels just

before the FOMC meeting. Rates have retraced a portion of these in-

creases in recent days as favorable data on inflation, against the

backdrop of skittish conditions in financial markets, have led market

participants to all but eliminate the prospects for policy tightening

1. Financial market quotations in this section are taken as of
noon, Friday, December 16.

2. The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, which was
initially left unchanged at $225 million, was lowered twice over the
intermeeting period, in steps of $50 million, to capture the typical
winter decline in seasonal borrowing.



at the December meeting. Still, on balance over the intermeeting

period, the term structures of federal funds and Eurodollar futures

rates shifted up appreciably, and short-term rates rose 25 to 50 basis

points (Chart 1). In contrast to earlier this year, strong

economic data did not have an adverse impact on the bond market. In

fact, over the intermeeting period, longer-term yields shed 15 to 25

basis points. The relatively good inflation data, together with the

more aggressive policy action, seemed to increase the confidence of

market participants that policy would be firmed sufficiently to pre-

vent a breakout of inflation. Under that interpretation, real inter-

est rates may have risen across much of the maturity spectrum, which

would be consistent with the recent strength in the value of the

dollar on foreign exchange markets. In weighted-average terms, the

U.S. dollar has appreciated about 2 percent since the last FOMC meet-

ing and nearly 5 percent from November 1, just prior to the U.S. mone-

tary authorities' exchange market intervention.4 Also suggestive

of a rise in real rates, and perhaps of more risks to the profit out-

look than were expected at the time of the last FOMC meeting, major

equity market indexes fell from 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent.

(3) Financial markets were focused for a time on the events

surrounding the difficulties of an investment fund run by Orange

County, California that pushed the fund and the County into filing for

3. The one-month commercial paper rate rose 80 basis points, but
nearly half of that rise occurred when that maturity crossed into
1995. That increase implies a year-end provision of about 2-3/4
percentage points. Current market talk centers around overnight rates
of about 8 percent for federal funds over the year-end weekend.

bankruptcy. The municipal market bore the brunt of these develop-

ments, and rates rose relative to comparable Treasury issues, as in-

vestors and rating agencies traced out the ripple effects on the cash

flows of the municipalities invested in the fund and speculated as to

whether other state and local issuers may have followed Orange

County's investment strategy. Uncertainty abated when, amid intense

public scrutiny, only a few other problem situations emerged, and the

ratio of municipal to Treasury yields returned to its level before the

Orange County revelations. More generally, many risk premiums have

edged higher over the intermeeting period, but remain thin by

historical norms, and some measures of expected volatility have

increased.

(4) M2 resumed growing in November, at a 3/4 percent rate,

and was appreciably stronger than had been anticipated at the time of

the last bluebook. This strength probably reflected some substitu-

tion out of mutual funds, as well as the surprising vigor of nominal

spending. Bond mutual funds were hit hard by outflows throughout the

month, while inflows to equity funds slowed markedly in November.5

Small time deposits and money market mutual funds, whose offering

rates have at least partly adjusted to higher market rates, grew at

double-digit rates in November. In contrast, the rates on liquid

deposits have moved very little this year, and those deposits con-

tinued to contract last month. The higher opportunity cost of M2

5. M2 plus stock and bond funds (excluding retirement accounts) was
about unchanged in November, as net redemptions and capital losses for
mutual funds offset the slow growth of M2.

6. M1 declined at a 3/4 percent annual rate in November, sending
reserves down at a 3-1/4 percent rate. With currency growth expanding
at about a 10 percent pace, the monetary base rose at a 8-1/2 percent
rate last month.



has induced households to seek investment alternatives, and, indica-

tive of that pursuit, net noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions

were again strong in November. On a quarterly average basis, the

velocity of M2 is expected to increase at a 7 percent rate in the

fourth quarter, pulling up its rise on the year to 5-1/2 percent. In

contrast to the previous several years, the rise in velocity in 1994

is broadly consistent with the predictions of standard models that

rely on the relative movements of deposit and short-term market rates.

From the fourth quarter of 1993 to November, M2 has grown at a 1 per-

cent rate, at the lower bound of its 1 to 5 percent annual range.

(5) The growth of M3 outpaced that of M2 again in November,

but slowed from the previous month, leaving this aggregate about 1-1/4

percent at an annual rate above its level in the fourth quarter of

last year--in the lower half of its annual range of 0 to 4 percent.

Institution-only money funds decelerated appreciably last month, owing

to redemptions by sophisticated investors as they switched toward

direct holdings after the November 15 policy move. Bank issuance of

large time deposits continued to be brisk, but bank emphasis on other

managed liabilities lessened a bit further last month. Apparently,

they again relied on selling some of their securities holdings to fund

loan growth. Overall bank credit increased at about a 3 percent rate

in November--close to the pace in each of the previous three months--

with total loans expanding at more than an 8 percent annual clip.

(6) Available data suggest that the growth of the debt of

nonfederal sectors has continued at a moderate pace in recent months.

In the business sector, a widening financing gap and a pickup in the

pace of merger activity have apparently pushed nonfinancial firms

toward external funding, which has remained focused on bank loans



and the commercial paper market. Households' appetite for consumer

debt has shown no sign of flagging; consumer credit recorded another

two-digit growth rate in October and was on track for another strong

month in November, at least according to bank data. Despite higher

interest rates, little evidence of a slowdown in mortgage borrowing

has emerged. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt over October

and November appears to be in line with that of previous months, leav-

ing this aggregate in the lower half of its monitoring range. With

growth from the fourth quarter of 1994 just a shade over 5 percent,

total debt will likely expand at a slower rate than nominal GDP this

year,

Policy Alternatives

(7) Two policy alternatives are presented below for con-

sideration by the Committee. Alternative B would keep the intended

federal funds rate at 5-1/2 percent. The associated level of adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing would initially be $125 million, but

borrowing would subsequently drift lower in keeping with the typical

winding down of demands for seasonal credit. Alternative C entails a

50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate, to 6 percent, achieved

either through an equivalent increase in the discount rate with the

same path for the borrowing allowance or an increase in the initial

borrowing allowance to $175 million, with the same seasonal reductions

thereafter.

(8) In light of the prospects for aggregate demand and the

likelihood that the economy already is operating a little beyond its

sustainable potential, the staff believes that damping inflation pres-

sures will require a substantial further tightening of policy before

very long, although not necessarily at this meeting. The Greenbook

economic forecast assumes a further increase of 100 to 150 basis

points in the federal funds rate by early spring. Financial markets

appear to have built in a similar amount of policy tightening through

next spring (though still more thereafter), and the prospective rise

in short-term rates should keep real long-term rates at or slightly

above current levels and preserve the recent gains in the real ex-

change value of the dollar. This restraint is viewed as reducing

pressures on resources enough to stabilize inflation in 1996 at just

over 3 percent.

(9) Keeping the stance of policy unchanged, as under alter-

native B, might appear warranted in light of the size of the recent

action and of current financial conditions. Real short- and long-term



interest rates now look to be somewhat above longer-term averages, the

dollar has moved higher, and all money measures have remained slug-

gish. If the Committee thought these developments implied a reason-

able probability that policy actions to date had put in place suffi-

cient restraint to contain inflation, it might want to await addi-

tional information in gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any

future action. Moreover, the Committee might have gained some leeway

to pause in its tightening, despite persistent strength in production

and spending indicators, because the larger move in November, together

with favorable wage and price data, has helped to calm developing

inflation fears. Furthermore, after the news on Orange County and on

derivatives-related difficulties at some bank holding companies, mar-

ket participants seem to be especially wary of additional announce-

ments of large losses on leveraged or derivatives positions. Through

year-end, lenders are likely to be particularly conscious of possible

credit quality problems of the counterparties that show up on their

published statements. While a policy tightening on December 20 is

unlikely to trigger market dislocations, such a possibility cannot be

ruled out; in any case, the chances of such problems will be even more

remote after year-end.

(10) As noted above, market participants now assess the

probability of a near-term tightening as fairly low, but they see an

intermeeting move before the next scheduled FOMC meeting on January 31

and February 1 as more likely. In these circumstances, and given the

seemingly greater confidence of late in financial markets that the

System will act as appropriate to counter a buildup in inflationary

pressures, interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar

are unlikely to change very much in the immediate aftermath of a deci-

sion to leave policy unchanged, as under Alternative B. Movements in



financial markets subsequently will depend, of course, on the nature

of incoming data. Continued strength in employment or final demand,

especially if accompanied by adverse wage and price developments,

would firm market expectations of System action early next year.

Inaction in the face of such data could risk the re-emergence of con-

cerns that the Federal Reserve was falling behind in its efforts to

contain inflation, raising long-term interest rates and weakening the

foreign exchange value of the dollar.

(11) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate

under alternative C might be favored if the Committee viewed the

recent string of surprisingly strong economic data as clearly indicat-

ing that the risks are still tilted in the direction of sustained

faster inflation. The resulting 6 percent federal funds rate would

imply a real federal funds rate that falls more assuredly in a zone

that could be characterized as moderately restrictive. Following so

soon after the November move, a policy tightening at this meeting

would consolidate, or even extend, the gains made in reducing infla-

tion expectations in financial markets. The inclination to adopt

alternative C would be bolstered by a belief that financial markets

have largely absorbed the Orange County shock and the risks of further

disruptions are de minimus.

(12) Under alternative C, money market interest rates would

firm somewhat, especially those at the shortest end, as the tightening

would come somewhat sooner than now expected. To the degree that

market participants saw such an action as evidence of an even stronger

anti-inflationary resolve of the Committee, nominal forward rates at

intermediate- and longer-term maturities would tend to decline, limit-

ing any increase in longer-term rates. Real interest rates, however,

would rise, bolstering the foreign exchange value of the dollar.



-10-

Quality spreads could widen a bit as higher rates increased debt-ser-

vicing burdens and raised questions about the ongoing strength of the

expansion.

(13) Borrowing by nonfederal sectors through early 1995

should remain moderate. Nonfinancial businesses are projected to

reduce their borrowing, particularly from the commercial paper market

and banks, partly because we see the recent spate of debt-financed

share retirements as an unusual bulge that is not likely to be sus-

tained. Acting to cushion this slowdown will be borrowing to finance

rising capital outlays as profits flatten out. Household debt, too,

is projected to decelerate--to a pace more in line with that of

earlier this year. This moderation owes to a projected slowing in

the growth of consumption outlays, especially on durables, and to a

decline in residential housing activity. The sustained contraction of

the debt of state and local governments is expected to draw to a

close, once past a substantial volume of retirements at the beginning

of next year. On balance, debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to

grow at around a 5 percent pace over the period from November to

March, about in line with the average pace of 1994 as a whole, and the

total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors to expand through March at

a 5-1/4 percent annual rate.

(14) Projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from

November to March are shown below under both alternatives. (More

detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following pages.)

The staff expects the growth of the monetary aggregates to remain

damped over coming months, restrained by prior (and under alternative

C, current) increases in opportunity costs. Nonetheless, growth rates

for the aggregates generally are a little faster than envisioned in

November. Expansion in nominal income is now seen as stronger over



the late months of 1994 and early months of 1995. In addition, the

broader aggregates are likely to be buoyed slightly by shifts from

longer-term mutual funds in the wake of less attractive returns and

unfavorable publicity; however, with deposit rates still well short of

market rates, most of the savings diverted from mutual funds is likely

to continue to go into direct purchases of securities.

Growth from November
to March Alt. B Alt. C

M2 1-1/4 1/2

M3 2-1/4 2

M1 -1 -2

(15) Under alternative B, M2 would strengthen to a 1-1/4

percent rate over the November-to-March period. Opportunity costs of

holding M2--especially the small time deposit and money market mutual

funds components--should narrow from current high levels as retail

deposit and money fund rates continue to adjust upward to recent in-

creases in market rates. As a result, growth in M2 velocity would

slow to a 5 percent rate in the first quarter of next year from a 7

percent rate in the current quarter. M1 would continue to edge down-

ward in response to previous increases in opportunity costs, although

the drag from the slowdown of mortgage refinancing activity will be

diminishing as such activity stabilizes at relatively low levels.7

Boosted in part by faster growth in M2, M3 would be expected to grow

at a 2-1/4 percent rate over the November-to-March period. In

addition, a pickup in M3-type money market mutual funds, as rates on

such funds catch up with market rates, would act to lift M3 growth.

7. With the deposit components of M1 contracting over the
November-to-March period, total reserves would fall at a 5 percent
annual rate. In contrast, the monetary base would rise at a 6 percent
pace, supported by the growth of currency.

Bank issuance of large CDs is expected to remain brisk, despite some

moderation in loan growth, as bank reliance on nondeposit funding

continues to abate.

(16) Under alternative C, opportunity costs would tend to

increase as the rise in money market rates outpaced those on M2 com-

ponents. M2 would expand at only a 1/2 percent rate over the Novem-

ber-to-March period, restrained by faster runoffs of M1 and savings

deposits (including MMDAs) than under alternative B. By March, M2

would stand about 1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1994 base, a

little below the bottom of its provisional growth range for 1995. M3

would expand at a 2 percent pace through March, damped by outflows

from M3-type money market mutual funds. Growth in M3 from the fourth

quarter of 1994 to March would be at a 2 percent rate, at the midpoint

of its provisional range for 1995.

Directive Language

(17) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT

(SLIGHTLY)/MAINTAIN/increase significantly (SOMEWHAT/

SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions, [taking account of a possible increase in the

discount rate]. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable

economic growth, and giving careful consideration to

economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or

somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT)

be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contem-

plated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent

with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
