Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In light of information suggesting added risk of a pronounced

weakening in the economic expansion, pressures on reserve markets were

eased in two separate steps during the intermeeting period.1 The federal

funds rate, which was a bit above 9 percent at the time of the October

meeting, is currently around 8-1/2 percent. The borrowing objective was

reduced in stages from $550 million at the time of the last FOMC meeting

to $250 million, reflecting declines totaling $100 million to effect the

easing of policy and $200 million to take account of trends in seasonal

borrowing. (Seasonal credit has continued to drop steeply, from $430

million immediately preceding the FOMC meeting to $160 million in the

first week of the current maintenance period.) Borrowing was boosted over

the long Columbus Day weekend and ran above its allowance for the first

maintenance period. Since then, however, borrowing has generally come in

below the reduced path allowances, and is running at $185 million through

the first week of this maintenance period.

(2) The easing of policy--only a portion of which had been

anticipated by the market--and evidence of a sluggish economy caused mar-

ket participants to mark down their expectations of interest rates for

some time into the future. Thus, not only did most short-term rates

prices on October 13, as financial markets remained skittish and vola-
tile for a time.



decline roughly in line with the 1/2 point drop in the federal funds rate,

but rates on one-year Treasury bills and Treasury notes fell by similar

amounts; bond yields dropped somewhat less. Disruptions to bill auctions

and pressures arising from substantial incoming supplies of cash-manage-

ment bills limited the declines in short-term Treasury bill rates: for

example, rates on 3-month Treasury bills are about unchanged over the

intermeeting period. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages in both primary and

secondary markets fell about in line with Treasury bond yields.

(3) The generally rising prices elsewhere in financial markets

were not apparent in the equity and junk bond sectors. Amid growing

indications of a softer economy and declining corporate profits, as well

as difficulties of previously restructured firms, investors began ques-

tioning the earnings and cash-flow projections underpinning highly lever-

aged financing and equity valuation. Evidence that financing for share

buyouts would be less readily available helped to precipitate a sharp

decline in stock prices on October 13, just days after stock price indexes

set new highs. An initial, partial recovery of stock prices was subse-

quently reversed, leaving most averages more than 5 percent lower over the

intermeeting period. In the junk bond market, lower quality issues suf-

fered the deepest losses, and average spreads versus Treasury yields

widened further from the record levels seen in September.

(4) The weighted average value of the dollar in terms of other

G-10 currencies declined about 1-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period.

The dollar was generally buoyant early in the period, despite

and a round of official interest rate



increases in Europe. The dollar reached its high on October 11, the day

the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate. Following the October 13

stock market drop, the dollar moved lower. Market expectations of further

interest rate hikes abroad, along with additional easing by the Federal

Reserve, contributed to this softness. The continued volatility of stock

prices and more general concerns about financial fragility may have helped

push gold prices to their highest levels since midsummer.

Desk sales totaled $1.2 billion against marks and

yen, all in the first ten days of the period.

(5) Growth of all three monetary aggregates picked up in October.

M2 expanded at an 8 percent rate last month, above the 6-1/2 percent

growth rate specified by the Committee for the September-to-December

period, as M1 growth jumped to a 10 percent rate. A surge in demand

deposits early in October--perhaps as compensating balances adjusted to

earlier rate declines--contributed to the unanticipated strength. Growth

of the retail-type components of M2 slowed from their average pace in

August and September, consistent with waning effects of earlier declines

in interest rates. Money market mutual funds reportedly benefited some-

what from shifts out of junk bond funds, but their growth for the month

was in line with past experience based on movements in relative interest

rates, suggesting that the unusual shifts did not add a great deal to

overall M2 growth. Since the fourth quarter of last year, M2 has

increased at a 4-1/4 percent rate and stands in the lower half of its 1989

target range.



(6) M3 expanded at a 4-1/4 percent rate in October, well above

the pace of the preceding two months, and close to the Committee's

expected growth rate of 4-1/2 percent from September to December. Bank

credit expansion strengthened substantially in October. Although a por-

tion of this was financed by M2 deposit transfers from failed thrifts

arranged by RTC, banks also turned to issuance of large CDs, boosting M3

growth. Asset runoffs at capital-deficient thrifts and associated

declines in RPs and large CDs seem to have depressed M3 growth about as

much as they had in August and September.

(7) Partial data suggest that nonfinancial debt grew at around an

8 percent rate in October, about maintaining the pace of the third quarter

and keeping this aggregate in the middle of its monitoring range. Busi-

ness debt growth apparently picked up last month, despite a dropoff in

equity retirements. Lower yields sparked a strengthening of corporate

bond issuance, while shorter-term business borrowing was little changed,

as a falloff in commercial paper issuance about offset faster C&I lending

by banks. In the household sector, data on consumer credit indicated no

growth in September, but this weakness may reflect difficulties in sea-

sonal adjustment; consumer lending by banks, adjusted for securitization,

expanded at about a 10 percent rate in both September and October. Real

estate lending at commercial banks slowed a little in October from the

brisk pace of September, but issuance of pass-through securities by

federal agencies remained robust.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Two alternatives are presented below for Committee considera-

tion. In alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around

8-1/2 percent, a level expected to be associated with adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing of $200 million. In alternative A, a federal funds

rate around 8 percent would be accompanied by a borrowing assumption of

$100 million. The $100 million difference between the alternatives'

borrowing assumptions still seems appropriate in light of the reduced

sensitivity of borrowing as it nears frictional levels. Both borrowing

levels embody a downward technical adjustment of $50 million from the

current $250 million allowance in recognition of recent and anticipated

further seasonal declines in seasonal borrowing. Continuing uncertainty

about borrowing behavior, however, still appears to justify flexibility in

the Desk's approach to the borrowing objective.

(9) Market interest rates generally are expected to remain around

current levels under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alterna-

tive B. The structure of market interest rates appears to embody another

slight easing of monetary policy, but most probably not until late this

year or early next year. In addition, impressions of a sluggish economy,

consistent with data flows likely under the staff forecast, may continue

to foster expectations of future policy easing, even if federal funds

rates remain near 8-1/2 percent. Unlike most other rates, those on short-

term Treasury bills may drop once the large supply of cash management

bills is absorbed into portfolios, with the 3-month bill rate moving down

toward 7-1/2 percent. The exchange value of the dollar could exhibit



-7-

little net change over the intermeeting period under alternative B, though

any policy tightening abroad may tend to exert downward pressure on the

dollar.

(10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate

under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than market partici-

pants are now expecting. Rates on other short-term instruments would

decline by nearly the same amount, with the 3-month bill rate dropping

ultimately toward the 7 percent area. In response to the further narrow-

ing of differentials between U.S. and foreign interest rates, the exchange

value of the dollar could be expected to adjust downward. Bond yields

probably would decline noticeably under alternative A; market participants

may interpret an immediate further easing as suggesting a more aggressive

policy posture by the Federal Reserve, and perhaps an assessment of sub-

stantial underlying weakening in the economy. However, should incoming

data show the economy continuing to advance at its recent pace over coming

months, in the context of a weaker dollar, the cumulative effect of past

easing measures and alternative A over a short time might be viewed as

setting the stage for a subsequent strengthening of the economy, raising

questions about prospects for prices.

(11) Anticipated growth of the monetary aggregates under the two

alternatives is shown in the table below. (More detailed data appear in

the table and charts on the following pages.) Under either alternative,

M2 and M3 are projected to finish the year within their annual ranges,

with M2 near the midpoint of its range and M3 somewhat above the lower

bound of its range.

(12) Even under the unchanged interest rates of alternative B, M2

growth would remain close to last month's brisk pace, buoyed by recent

declines in market interest rates and opportunity costs. Under this

alternative, M2 is expected to expand at a 7-1/4 percent average annual

rate in November and December; growth from September to December and on a

fourth-quarter average basis would be 7-1/2 percent. This combines with

the staff's nominal GNP projection of 5 percent for the quarter to imply a

2-1/2 percent rate of decline in M2 velocity, roughly consistent with

model-based forecasts incorporating the recent reductions in opportunity

costs. M1 is projected to slow to a 6-1/4 percent rate in the last two

2
months of the year from the elevated pace of October. Representing a

partial offset, however, inflows to nontransaction retail deposits are

seen as strengthening somewhat this month and next, as the effects of the

recent policy easings take hold.

2. This projection includes a strengthening in demand deposits in
December, reflecting an expected need to adjust compensating balances
upward before closing the books on 1989, as a consequence of interest
rate declines this quarter. Such year-end adjustments have occurred in
several recent years.

(13) M3 growth under alternative B will continue to be damped by

the ongoing shedding of assets by undercapitalized S&Ls and by funds

supplied through RTC resolutions. However, M3 is expected to grow in

November and December a bit faster than in October, leaving expansion over

the last three months of the year at a 4-1/2 percent rate. The pace of

decline in S&L assets is expected to wane a little over the next two

months from the extremely rapid pace of the last few months, and RTC

resolutions should slow after the fiscal year-end spurt. As a

consequence, outflows of large time deposits and term RPs at thrifts

should abate somewhat. Commercial bank credit is likely to slow but

expansion of managed liabilities will be maintained, in part to compensate

for reduced RTC funds of thrift deposit transfers. Growth of domestic

nonfinancial debt is expected to moderate to around 7 percent over the

rest of the year, owing mainly to a slowing of federal government debt.

This would leave the debt aggregate in the fourth quarter 8-1/4 percent

above its year-earlier level, close to the midpoint of its monitoring

range.

(14) Under alternative A, growth of M2 and M3 through December

would be boosted slightly by the associated decline in market interest

rates and easing of lending conditions. September-to-December M2 and M3

growth would rise to 8 and 4-3/4 percent rates, respectively.

(15) The recent easing, which would be maintained under alterna-

tive B, and any additional easing under alternative A, would have impor-

tant effects on money growth in the first quarter of next year. Under

alternative B, M2 would expand around the 7 percent upper limit of its



-11-

tentative range in the early months of 1990. Alternative A likely would

yield M2 growth noticeably above the upper end of the tentative growth

cone, though well within the parallel lines. Under either alternative, M3

would grow in the lower half of the 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 tentative range for

this aggregate.

Directive Language

(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

standard options and updating, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT(SLIGHTLY)/ maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price

stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of

the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and

domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve

restraint might (WOULD) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint (MIGHT) would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent

with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from September through

December at annual rates of about ____ [DEL: 6-1/2] and ____ [DEL: 4-1/2] percent,

respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if

it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve

conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to

be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a

range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7 to 11] percent.
