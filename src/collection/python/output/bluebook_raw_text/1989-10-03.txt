Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC September 29, 1989

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Federal Reserve has maintained an unchanged stance in

the reserves market since the August FOMC meeting. The borrowing objec-

tive has been kept at $550 million, and borrowing averaged $554 million in

the two complete maintenance periods since that meeting. Through the

first eight days of the current maintenance period, borrowing has

increased to $758 million, but $166 million of this appears to be attrib-

utable to problems associated with Hurricane Hugo. Seasonal credit has

dropped only a little since the past meeting, and adjustment borrowing

(abstracting from the hurricane's effect) remains unusually low. Federal

funds have traded mostly in a narrow range around 9 percent, as they have

since late July.

(2) With federal funds steady and economic data released over the

intermeeting period generally according with market expectations, most

interest rates are little changed on balance. Rates did soften some

through mid-September, at least partly on a sense that the strengthening

dollar could improve the odds of an easing in monetary policy. In the

case of Treasury securities, this movement was accentuated by the well-

publicized difficulties of a few prominent issuers of junk bonds that

touched off a mild flight to quality. At their intermeeting lows, Trea-

sury bill rates were down about 1/2 percentage point, and Treasury bond

yields had fallen 1/4 point. These gains began to erode when tensions in

the junk bond market eased and interest rates generally edged higher as



the dollar declined against other G-10 currencies. The stock market

reached record highs in early September but began to retreat as problems

emerged in junk bonds; on balance most indexes still are up 2 to 3 percent

over the intermeeting period.

(3) Interest rates on mortgages and mortgage-related securities

generally have fallen relative to yields on benchmark Treasury issues.

Narrower spreads in the mortgage market likely owe to improved investor

confidence in the ability of the market to absorb assets from thrifts.

Commercial banks, the federal mortgage agencies, and insurance companies

among others, have proven willing to step up acquisitions of mortgage

assets. Given this apparent willingness, along with evidence of some

rebound in housing sales, it is believed that mortgage credit has been

well maintained in recent months.

(4) The dollar strengthened through mid-September, despite the

edging down of interest rates in the United States and some increase in

rates abroad. Subsequently the dollar eased, and then dropped sharply

immediately after the release of the G-7 statement on September 23 and the

associated visible coordinated intervention

In addition, growing market expectations that monetary policy abroad might

be tightened have contributed to the slippage of the dollar in recent

days. On balance over the intermeeting period, the dollar is 2-1/2 per-

cent lower against the trade-weighted average of other G-10 currencies.



. The Desk sold about $3.4 billion against yen and marks,

nearly $1 billion of this total following the G-7 meeting.

(5) Growth in the monetary aggregates slowed in August and Sep-

tember from their advanced July pace, which likely had been boosted by the

replenishment of balances used to pay taxes last spring. M1 rose at a

rate of only 3/4 percent in August, and is expected to increase at around

a 5 percent clip in September. While M2 also decelerated, its growth

remained at a brisk 7-1/4 percent pace over August and September. At an

8-3/4 percent rate, the June-to-September expansion of M2 is near the

Committee's specification at the August FOMC meeting of 9 percent, and has

lifted M2 to about 4 percent, at an annual rate, above its 1988-Q4 base.

Weakness in demand deposits and overnight RPs and Eurodollars restrained

M2 in August and September; the retail components of M2 expanded at close

to a 10 percent pace in all three months of the quarter. Growth in these

components has been supported by the lagged effects of earlier declines in

market interest rates. Inflows to money funds were particularly strong,

buoyed by the drop in small time deposit rates, shifts from junk bond

funds, and special promotional activities by certain fund sponsors.

Deposit expansion was concentrated at commercial banks as the yield

advantage on thrift deposits shrank. On balance, the thrift bailout so

far seems primarily to have affected the composition of M2, rather than

its growth rate.

1. Currency contributed importantly to this acceleration in Ml, lifting
growth of the monetary base from a 1-1/4 percent rate in August to an
estimated 7-1/2 percent pace in September.



(6) In contrast to its minimal net effect on the growth of M2,

the restructuring of the thrift industry has stunted growth of M3. Expan-

sion of this aggregate slipped to less than a 2 percent rate over August

and September, lower even than the 5-3/4 percent pace projected at the

August FOMC meeting. This brought June-to-September growth to 4 percent,

compared with the 7 percent specification of the Committee, moving it to

around the lower bound of its 1989 target cone. Before today, the RTC

had disbursed a little over half of the $20 billion authorized for spend-

ing in fiscal year 1989. However, only a portion of these funds, per-

haps $4 to $5 billion by month-end, had been used to directly replace

liabilities in M3, including deposit payoffs at liquidated institutions.3

More important for M3 have been the efforts of a much broader group of

inadequately capitalized thrift institutions to shrink their balance

sheets. These undercapitalized thrifts account for the bulk of the over

$17 billion decline (40 percent at an annual rate) in the sum of large

time deposits and term RPs at thrift institutions from July to September.

As a group, thrifts account for slightly more than half of the shortfall

of M3 in September relative to the Committee's August path, with most of

the remainder attributable to a significantly higher Treasury balance at

commercial banks--itself partly a product of funding the thrift bailout--

and some shortfall in bank credit.

2. An additional $8 billion was scheduled to be disbursed today, the
last day of the fiscal year, through a special transaction that placed
government securities in thrifts funded by a note issued to the RTC. At
this writing, it is not clear whether this transaction has been com-
pleted.
3. The balance, aside from that disbursed today, was used to pay down

advances from Federal Home Loan Banks and other non-M3 borrowings.

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are calcu-

months. The September figures assume an average level of adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $645 million--including $95 million of special situation borrowing
associated with Hurricane Hugo--and excess reserves of $950 million for the mainte-
nance period ending October 4.



-6-

(7) The trend of debt growth appears to have been well maintained

in recent months. Debt of the nonfinancial sectors appears to have

accelerated to about a 9-1/2 percent rate of growth in August, but much of

this pickup can be traced to a burst of short-term borrowing by the Trea-

sury to cover the RTC's initial outlays; private debt growth appears to

have quickened slightly. Consumer credit likely grew faster in August, at

least in part because of incentive-driven increases in auto sales. The

pace of borrowing in the business sector ebbed in August, however, and

appears to be fairly subdued in September as well.



Policy Alternatives

(8) Three alternatives are presented below. Under alternative B,

a federal funds rate of around 9 percent would be expected to be asso-

ciated, at least initially, with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of

$500 million. This level of borrowing is $50 million less than the cur-

rent assumption, in order to take into account the decline in seasonal

borrowing that is likely to occur early in the intermeeting period. Based

on the experience of last year, seasonal borrowing should not only drop

significantly in the next maintenance period but also fall substantially

further over the balance of the intermeeting period, suggesting that

another downward technical adjustment might be called for before the next

meeting. Such adjustments are needed this year because seasonal borrowing

has reached record levels and its seasonal decline will be exceptionally

large. Moreover, with adjustment borrowing close to frictional levels, it

probably is relatively insensitive to movements in the spread between the

federal funds and discount rates. Thus, in current circumstances the

funds rate would tend to rise appreciably in the absence of technical

adjustments to the borrowing assumption because the interest sensitivity

of seasonal and adjustment borrowing combined is quite low. This also

implies that, under alternative A, a decline of only $100 million in the

borrowing objective--to $400 million--is likely to be associated with a

decrease in the federal funds rate to around 8-1/2 percent; similarly, a

rise of only $100 million in borrowing--to $600 million--would be asso-

ciated with an increase in the federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent

under alternative C. In any event, owing to the continued uncertainty



about the borrowing relationship, some flexibility in pursuit of the bor-

rowing objective would again seem to be warranted.

(9) Under all of the alternatives, M2 is expected to stay comfor-

tably within its annual range this year. Indeed, supported by previous

declines in market interest rates, this aggregate would continue to rise

within the lower half of its range over the remainder of this year. M3 is

likely to grow sluggishly under all three alternatives, remaining a little

above the lower end of its annual range. Growth of this aggregate will be

damped by ongoing reductions in assets and M3 liabilities at undercapi-

talized thrifts and by RTC outlays that substitute in part for M3 managed

liabilities. However, the staff has assumed both of these activities will

slow somewhat on average in the fourth quarter from the pace of recent

months, contributing to some acceleration in M3. M1 would expand under

all three alternatives, returning it by year-end to about its level at the

end of 1988.

-10-

(10) Interest rates would be expected to remain near current

levels under alternative B. Markets do not now appear to be anticipating

any near-term change in policy, and incoming economic data consistent

with the staff greenbook forecast are not likely to provoke significant

change in market sentiment. In the weeks ahead, Treasury markets may be

buffeted by the possible sale of sizable volumes of REFCORP bonds and by

shifting odds on triggering a debt ceiling decline on November 1, which

could affect the mid-quarter refunding. The dollar would be expected to

fluctuate around current lower levels, or weaken a little further should

some key foreign central banks tighten policy--as to a degree now seems to

be expected by markets. Should the dollar rebound strongly, however,

domestic interest rates might edge off if market participants saw this as

implying reduced inflation pressures and greater prospects for policy

easing in the United States.

(11) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to grow at a 6-1/2 per-

cent annual rate over the September-to-December period, a little below the

recent pace. This implies quarterly average growth at a 6-3/4 percent

rate and a further decline in velocity at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, re-

flecting the lagged effects of earlier interest rate declines. Monthly

inflows to retail M2 would be expected to moderate as the effects of pre-

vious declines in opportunity costs abate, and as money funds no longer

are boosted by shifts from junk bond funds and by special promotional

efforts. Retail deposit growth at thrift institutions is likely to remain

sluggish owing to the less aggressive bidding posture of these institu-

tions recently. On the other hand, overnight RPs are not expected to run



-11-

off further and demand deposits might strengthen if compensating balances

need to be boosted by year-end to take account of the lower level of mar-

ket interest rates. Overall, Ml should grow at around a 4-1/2 percent

rate over this period, near its September pace.

(12) Under alternative B, M3 growth would pick up a bit from its

August and September pace to a 4-1/2 percent rate. In addition to the

slowing of reductions in assets and M3 liabilities at thrifts, bank credit

may strengthen. While banks continue to enjoy relatively favorable core

deposit inflows, banks will need to tap additional managed liabilities to

fund the faster credit growth and replace balances withdrawn by the

Treasury. Banks should continue to make further large acquisitions of

mortgage assets, whose returns are still relatively attractive. More

generally, enlarged issuance of mortgage-backed securities and heightened

activity by sponsored agencies will facilitate the redistribution of

mortgage lending without further significant effects on its cost and

availability. In the business sector, borrowing is expected to remain

around the reduced pace of recent months, despite some dropoff in cor-

porate share retirements owing in part to the higher cost of leveraging.

Although Treasury borrowing also will slacken, this deceleration merely

represents-the movement of RTC financing off budget in the new fiscal

year, rather than a decline in underlying credit demands. In total,

domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to grow at around an 8 percent

annual rate over the fourth quarter, implying similar growth for the year,

a little below the midpoint of its annual monitoring range.



-12-

(13) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates are likely

to fall in tandem with the 50 basis point drop in the funds rate. The

dollar would decline, and the decline might be substantial if the Federal

Reserve's action were interpreted as a willingness to use monetary policy

to bring about a depreciation of the dollar. Bond rates probably would

move lower, though by less than short-term rates. Limiting the response

of bonds might be a sense that following the unanticipated easing of

policy, the economy could be a little stronger than previously expected in

1990 and price pressures somewhat amplified, especially if the drop in the

dollar were particularly sharp. The decline in rates would tend to boost

M2 growth to a somewhat faster pace than in August and September. Early

next year, the continuing effects of the further decline in opportunity

costs, along with a tendency for income growth to begin to strengthen,

likely would result in growth of M2 at a rate above the Committee's tenta-

tive range for 1990. M3 growth would strengthen to a 5 percent rate over

the September-to-December period under alternative A.

(14) The tightening of policy under alternative C would come as a

surprise to the markets, especially in the present international environ-

ment. Money market interest rates would rise by around the 50 basis point

hike in the federal funds rate, and the dollar would strengthen. With

such a tightening not built into yield curves, bond rates would be

expected to firm somewhat in the near term as the market reassessed the

degree of aggressiveness by the System in pursuing its price stability

objective. M2 growth over the September-to-December period would slow to

a 5 percent rate. The composition of inflows would move toward small time



-13-

deposits, whose rates adjust more promptly, and away from liquid accounts;

its M1 component would slow to a 2-1/2 percent rate. The restraining

effects of higher interest rates and opportunity costs under this alterna-

tive should be sufficient to hold M2 to around the middle of its tentative

1990 range in the early part of next year. M3 would grow at only a 4

percent annual rate, ending the year very close to the lower end of its

1989 range.



-14-

Directive language

(15) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

usual options and updating, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability,

the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the

monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and

domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve

restraint might (WOULD) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint (MIGHT) would be acceptable in the intermeeting

period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June

through September THROUGH DECEMBER at annual rates of about

____ AND ____ [DEL: 9 and 7] percent, respectively. The Chairman may call

for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period

before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7

to 11] percent.
