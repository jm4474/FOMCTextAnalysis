Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Class I -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The announcement that the FOMC increased the target federal funds rate to 5

percent at its June meeting had been widely expected, but the move to a neutral directive

surprised many market participants.1 Treasury coupon yields tumbled 10 to 15 basis points

the day of the announcement, apparently as investors trimmed their odds for further policy

tightenings, and fell further on balance in subsequent weeks, partly in response to favorable

inflation data. Yields retraced these declines, however, in the weeks following the

Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on July 22. The testimony was widely read as

emphasizing both the risks of an uptick in inflation pressures and the Federal Reserve's

resolve to act "promptly and forcefully" should such pressures become more apparent. And

it provided a backdrop for market responses to subsequent data showing an acceleration of

labor costs, indications of a firming of activity abroad, and a weaker dollar. Most recently, in

response to continued benign inflation reports, interest rates have fallen back a bit, and for

the intermeeting period, on net, are about unchanged. 2 Judging from federal funds futures

quotes, market participants now see a 1/4 point tightening at the August FOMC meeting as

highly likely and attach some probability to further tightening later in the year. Equity prices

1. The federal funds rate averaged very close to the intended level over the intermeeting
period.

2. The posted rate declines at those maturities included in the midquarter refunding cycle
owed entirely to the switch to new on-the-run coupon securities at the refunding.

generally tracked movements in bond prices over the period-rising initially, dropping off

sharply late in July, and rebounding more recently. Major indexes show mixed net changes,

from up 2-1/2 percent to down 4-1/4 percent.

(2) Spreads of yields on many financial assets over Treasuries, including swap

spreads, widened appreciably during the intermeeting period, although some of that

movement has been reversed in the past few days.3 The widening in spreads seemed to be

prompted by heavy demands for fixed-rate financing in an environment of increased

uncertainty about the course of interest rates and concerns about the liquidity of markets

around the end of the year.4 5 Many corporations reportedly have shifted forward some

3. Swap spreads are the difference between the fixed rate paid under a swap agreement
and a benchmark Treasury rate.

4. Swap spreads are not very sensitive to changing perceptions of credit risk because
notional amounts are not exchanged under swap agreements, interest payments are netted,
and most active participants in the interest rate swaps market tend to be highly rated
institutions or to rely on various credit enhancement techniques.

5. Investors' concerns about Y2K funding conditions became more apparent as standard
six-month funding instruments crossed over the year-end. The yield on six-month
Eurodollar deposits, for example, edged up noticeably at the end ofJune, and the spread
between the six-month Eurodollar deposit yield and the six-month Treasury yield is
unusually wide (chart). Y2K effects in futures markets also seemed to become more
pronounced. The so-called Eurodollar butterfly spread widened appreciably, on balance,
over the intermeeting period. To help alleviate some of the concerns about funding
pressures around the year-end, the Board gave final approval on July 20 to a Special
Liquidity Facility (SLF) that would operate from October 1, 1999 through April 7, 2000.
The SLF will provide collateralized discount window loans to eligible depository institutions
at a rate of 150 basis points above the FOMC's target federal funds rate. SLF loans will
entail few of the administrative conditions that apply for other forms of discount window
credit.

longer-term issuance that they had planned for later this year or early next year. At the same

time, Treasury debt outstanding has been declining, contributing to a trend in relative debt

supplies that has tended to depress Treasury yields relative to comparable private yields.

Fallout from the events of last autumn may have exacerbated the resulting widening of

spreads. Market participants are more conscious of the possibility and consequences of a

widespread reduction in market liquidity, and the amount of funds committed to taking a

view on a narrowing of spreads probably has been reduced considerably. Moreover, the

willingness to take such positions may have been further diminished for a time by

counterparty credit concerns prompted by rumors that a large swap dealer was in trouble.

In the past few days, however, spreads have narrowed noticeably as interest rate volatility

and longer-term rates have declined in response to reduced fears about the possible extent

of monetary policy tightening and as concerns about possible financial difficulties of market

participants have diminished. Still, markets remain somewhat skittish and spreads are wider

than they were at the end of June.

(3) Over the intermeeting period, the dollar depreciated about 1 percent, on

balance, against a broad set of currencies; this performance averages an appreciation against

the index of the currencies of important developing country trading partners and a

depreciation against the index of the currencies of major industrial countries. The dollar fell

8 percent versus the yen, 3 percent against the euro, and 2 percent in terms of sterling. The

bulk of the dollar's decline against the major currencies started in mid-July amid data

releases suggesting a pickup in activity in Europe and Japan. Although central banks in



4

most industrial countries held their policy rates steady over the intermeeting period, longer-

term interest rates in many countries rose on the market's more upbeat assessment of

economic growth going forward. Spurred in part by data showing a sharp widening of the

trade balance, the dollar dropped further against European currencies in recent days.

Concerns about a stronger yen drove the Japanese authorities to intervene three times in

July. The depreciation of the dollar against the yen resumed in mid-August, as statements

by Japanese officials and an absence of further intervention by the Japanese government

apparently suggested to market participants that the willingness of Japanese authorities to

engage in measures to limit the rise in the yen may be diminishing.6

(4) Credit spreads widened across a broad range of international financial assets

during the intermeeting period. Corporate bond spreads against government obligations

rose 10 to 15 basis points in Germany, Japan, and Canada. In Latin America, financial

markets appeared particularly sensitive to prospects for rising interest rates in the United

States. Spreads were further boosted by the news very late in the period that Ecuador

would seek to reschedule its next Brady debt payment. In total, Brady yield spreads over

Treasuries widened appreciably, with the Emerging Market Bond Index spread increasing

150 basis points. The Brazilian realdepreciated about 10 percent against the dollar, but the

6.

The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the
System or the Treasury.

Mexican peso was little changed on balance, perhaps supported by rising crude oil prices

and an improving economic outlook. Concerns over the viability of Argentina's currency

board continued, as that country's recession appeared to deepen and political uncertainty

mounted ahead of this fall's presidential election. Equity prices fell about 10 percent in

Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. In Asia, renewed tensions between China and Taiwan, as

well as increasing speculation about a possible devaluation of the renminbi, were reflected in

falling equity prices in much of the region. The dollar appreciated about 4 percent versus

the Thai baht, the Korean won, and the Philippine peso, and over 11 percent against the

Indonesian rupiah amid continued political uncertainty and increasing doubts about the

reform of Indonesia's financial sector.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates has moderated in recent months.

In addition to the slower expansion in nominal output, the upward movement in market

interest rates over the spring and summer likely has been restraining M2 growth. A portion

of this effect likely owes to the decline in prepayments on mortgage-backed securities,

which are typically held for a time as liquid deposits. But a pickup in noncompetitive

tenders at Treasury auctions also suggests a growing attractiveness of market instruments

relative to M2 assets. Currency has expanded at around an 8 percent clip over recent

months, down a notch from the double-digit growth rates recorded over the first few

months of the year. The moderate advance in M2 has contributed to the relatively tepid

growth of M3. In addition, expansion in bank credit slowed sharply in July, likely damping



6

the growth of managed liabilities in M3. The generally sluggish rise in bank credit in July

likely reflected, in part, substitutions by businesses of bond financing for bank loans.

(6) Borrowing by nonfinancial sectors has been slower in recent months than

earlier in the year, similar to the pattern for money. Continued budget surpluses have kept

federal debt on a downward trend, and borrowing by other sectors has slowed noticeably.

Business borrowing, while off from earlier, remains faster than the growth of output, and

has been focused on the bond market Perhaps reflecting greater selectivity and preference

for liquidity on the part of investors, junk bond issuance has slackened and issuance in

general has shifted toward larger offerings by better-known firms. In the household sector,

the rise in mortgage rates appears to be holding down mortgage borrowing, especially cash-

out refinancing, while consumer credit has stayed on a slower trajectory relative to earlier in

the year.

Policy Alternatives

(7) In the staff forecast, bond yields and equity prices holding in their recent

ranges foster growth of real GDP near that of its potential over the next year and a half,

smoothing through quarterly gyrations arising from year 2000 effects. This slowing in GDP

growth from the pace of the past several years is produced by a substantial moderation in

the expansion of private domestic demand, which is only partly offset by a reduced drag

from the external sector and a pickup in government spending. The staff believes that

maintaining the financial conditions necessary to slow private domestic demand to this

degree will require two more quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate by the early

spring, one more than assumed in the June Greenbook. The unemployment rate remains

around its current low level, which produces increasing pressures on labor costs. The effect

of these pressures on inflation is reinforced by the turnaround in the prices of commodities

and imported goods as the dollar drifts lower. As a result, inflation is expected to trend

higher, with core consumer prices projected to expand around 2 percent over the four

quarters of this year and 2-1/2 percent next year.

(8) Despite the pickup in underlying inflation in the staff forecast, the Committee

may nonetheless prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as under

alternative B. The projected pickup in inflation, if realized, would be gradual and not likely

for some time to foster an appreciable increase in inflation expectations that could

destabilize financial markets or materially increase the ultimate cost to economic activity of

containing price pressures. Accordingly, policy makers would be afforded more time to



9

judge whether the rise in inflation in fact is likely to materialize. Such additional time might

be viewed as especially desirable if the Committee were to put less weight than the staff on

the possibility that underlying inflation trends are adverse. Recent data may suggest that

spending is on a lower trajectory than in the staff forecast--particularly because domestic

demand likely has not yet felt much of the effects of the run-up in interest rates and

flattening out of equity prices since early May. While some of the recent restraint from

financial markets would be rolled back should the Committee fail to validate prevailing

expectations of policy tightening, financial conditions on net could well remain more

restrictive than those that generally have prevailed this year. And the Committee may see

the wage and cost data as sufficiently ambiguous to reserve judgment on whether the

current level of tautness in labor markets will produce accelerating prices, especially since

trends in core consumer inflation and longer-run inflation expectations remain flat.

Moreover, recent developments may indicate that global financial markets are fragile, with

the potential for further deterioration as year-end approaches even absent a firming in

policy.

(9) News that the Committee was standing pat, as under alternative B, would

come as a considerable surprise in the market, triggering a rally in capital markets and

putting further downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar. That

reaction would be tempered if the Committee chose and announced a directive tilted toward

restraint, thus preserving expectations of a higher funds rate in the near term. This

approach might be favored if the Committee believed tightening was probably needed fairly



10

promptly but wanted to be more assured that an acceleration of costs and prices was in

train. In these circumstances, however, financial markets could remain volatile as market

participants awaited policy action, with possible adverse effects on spreads. If, instead, the

Committee thought that the sense in financial markets that policy tightening is almost

inevitable were inconsistent with its own assessment of the situation, this market

misconception could be countered by announcing that a neutral bias was being retained,

though the announcement would need to convey a more balanced sense of risks than the

market now sees as implied by the "asymmetrical symmetry" of the June directive and

related announcement. The expected path of short-term rates would be revised down, but a

traditional symmetry might elevate market participants' uncertainty about the Federal

Reserve's assessment of inflation risks and policy intentions in light of the inflationary

concerns expressed in the Chairman's testimony.

(10) The staff forecast suggests that there are substantial risks that price pressures

will be intensifying and by enough to require an appreciable tightening of policy ultimately

to stabilize inflation. If the Committee shares these concerns, it might see little to be gained

from delaying policy action and choose the 1/4 percentage point firming of alternative C

as an appropriate down payment. Even a sense that inflation risks were less pronounced

than in the staff forecast might lead the Committee to the view that a modest near-term

policy firming was warranted. As noted, failing to validate current market expectations of

policy action would tend to erode prevailing financial restraint, which may be seen as risking

unsustainable economic growth and greater strains in already-tight labor markets, thus



11

heightening the odds of accelerating prices. Given apparently mounting worries about the

secular imbalance in the U.S. trade position, the Committee especially might want to avoid

fostering doubts among global investors about the Federal Reserve's commitment to

contain inflation. Elevated market stresses apparently owe importantly both to uncertainty

surrounding the outlook for System action and some aversion on the part of traders and

investors to participate in the market in the fourth quarter. The former could be alleviated

by immediate action combined with an announcement suggesting little likelihood of

subsequent policy moves, while the latter might suggest that--because the Committee may

feel increasingly uncomfortable in tightening as the year wears on--action delayed now may

wind up being delayed for some time to come.

(11) Given the high odds market participants put on action at this meeting, the

announcement that the Committee was raising the intended federal funds rate 1/4

percentage point, as under alternative C, should produce little response in key financial

prices if no surprises are in store from the wording of the press release. The market

consensus has settled on a quarter-point move and the retention of a symmetric directive. If

the announcement of such a directive suggested to market participants that further action

was unlikely for some time, financial markets might rally to some extent, as investors

removed the modest odds on additional tightening that now seem built into the structure of

interest rates for the fourth quarter. If, instead, action on Tuesday were accompanied by a

directive tilted toward tightening, market participants could take it as a signal that additional

firming is in the cards this year--and more so even than is currently built into financial



12

prices. As a result, the term structure of interest rates would likely shift up and the dollar

would probably strengthen on exchange markets. Because additional tightening would be

taken as fairly imminent, market spreads would likely remain wide as issuers rushed to lock

in longer-term financing in advance of the Committee's next action. Indeed, if the

Committee thought that it likely would need to tighten again before year-end because it

wanted to forestall an upward trend to inflation like that in the staff forecast, century-date-

change considerations might strengthen the argument for a 50 basis point firming with a

symmetric directive at this meeting instead of a 25 basis point move with an asymmetric

directive. Such a move, by restoring the federal funds rate to its level of last August and by

getting ahead of market expectations, would have a very good chance of being seen as the

last action for the year. While interest rates and the dollar's exchange rate would rise

appreciably and equity prices likely would fall, helping to damp demand more than in the

staff forecast, the elements of volatility and uncertainty in the market associated with

possible near-term policy action would be greatly diminished. After the initial adjustment,

market conditions should settle down, providing a better environment for financial market

participants to plan their balance sheet management over the year-end.

(12) Staff projections for debt and money over the balance of the year allow for

some added demands for credit to finance inventories and a buildup of liquid assets and for

a modest displacement of credit demand from late in the year to the current quarter and

from markets to banks. Overall, however, the Y2K effects are modest. The expansion of

the debt of domestic nonfederal sectors is expected to be well maintained over the balance



13

of the year under the Greenbook forecast; the staff interprets the recent widening in risk

spreads as more indicative of strong demands for credit than of supply restrictions that

would restrain borrowing. Corporate borrowing is projected to slow relative to the rapid

pace on average over the first half of the year, but to remain substantial. More of that

borrowing is expected to occur in the next few months than later in the year, as issuers

show increasing wariness to tap market finance as the century date change approaches. And

borrowing could be boosted by efforts to build up liquidity to cover possible credit needs

into early next year in the event that funding markets are temporarily disrupted. The extent

to which businesses turn to credit markets in the near term will depend partly on whether

they believe they can count on borrowing from banks: Senior loan officers recently

reported that they are making Y2K lines available, at least to their current customers, and

are renewing existing lines with few restrictions on year-end draws. The runup in mortgage

rates is anticipated to restrain housing activity and mortgage borrowing. The growth of

consumer credit should be subdued, in part owing to the projected deceleration in purchases

of consumer durables. In the federal sector, Treasury debt is now expected to run off less

sharply in 1999 than was forecast in the June Greenbook. This is a result of the Treasury's

decision to aim for a higher end-of-year cash balance as a precaution against problems

during the century date change. Still, ongoing paydowns of Treasury debt over the next few

months on net will hold down the expansion of total nonfinancial sector debt to a 5 percent

rate in the second half of this year.



14

(13) Recent data on the monetary aggregates have provided little in the way of

surprise. Going forward, the effect on M2 growth of the slightly firmer money market rates

for the second half of the year foreseen in the Greenbook is about offset by the slightly

stronger cast to expected spending. Under alternative B, M2 is expected to grow at a 6-1/4

percent pace over the five months from July to December. Over the last two quarters of

the year, projected M2 velocity is about flat. The staff M2 forecast embodies modest

dislocations associated with the century date change, which on net should give a fillip to

money growth owing to a late-year shift toward currency and insured deposits from

investments outside M2. M3 is expected to be buoyed by these effects and by a pickup in

bank credit induced by precautionary borrowing, pushing M3 growth over the July-to-

December period up to 7 percent. The staff anticipates that both aggregates will end the

year above their annual ranges. The firming in policy under alternative C occurs late enough

this year to impart only slight restraint on the aggregates in 1999.



Directive Language

(14) Presented below for the members' consideration is the operational paragraph

for the intermeeting period

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and

sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in

reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/increasing/DECREASING the federal

funds rate to an average of around ____ [DEL: 5] percent. In view of the evidence currently

available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant

an increase or a decrease [MORE LIKELY TO WARRANT AN INCREASE/A

DECREASE THAN A DECREASE /AN INCREASE] in the federal funds rate operating

objective during the intermeeting period.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 13 are week-ending averages. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior
to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Column 14 Is the Bond Buyer revenue index, which Is a 1-day quote for Thursday. Column 15 Is the average contract rate on new
commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
