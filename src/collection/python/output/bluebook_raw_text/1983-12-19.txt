preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M2 decelerated to a 7-3/4 percent annual rate in November as

both its transactions and nontransactions components slowed, and data so

far available suggest a similar rate for December. Given the relatively

more rapid October growth, M2 over the 3-month September-to-December period

is likely to be close to the 8-1/2 percent annual rate specified by the

Comittee. As can be seen in the table below, from its February-March

base, M2 is estimated to have grown at close to an 8 percent annual rate to

the fourth quarter, in the lower half of its 7 to 10 percent long-run

range. Of course, growth for the year as a whole was substantially more

rapid, as shown in the table on the following page, because of the shift

of funds into MMDAs early in the year.

(2) M3 accelerated to a 12-1/2 percent annual rate in November,

bringing growth over the past two months to 10-1/2 percent. In large

measure, this pick-up reflected very heavy reliance on managed liabilities

to fund a considerable acceleration in bank credit expansion in the face

e - Preliminary estimate
1. Fourth quarter to fourth quarter growth rates, except for the credit

aggregates, which are measured from December to December, and borrowing and
excess reserves, which are average levels for the year. The data for 1983

of a massive rundown of Treasury balances. Same slowing of M3 growth

from the rapid November pace appears to be in train for December, although

this aggregate is likely to remain above its 3-month September-to-December

growth path of 8-1/2 percent. Fran the fourth quarter of 1982 to the

fourth quarter of 1983, M3 has advanced at close to the upper bound of

its 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent target range.

(3) Expansion of M1 slowed to only a 3/4 percent annual rate

in November, leaving this aggregate just above the lower bound of its 5

to 9 percent monitoring range and considerably short of the 5 to 6 per-

cent growth rate range established by the Committee for September-to-

December. The weakness in M1 continued to reflect declines in demand

deposits, which in November dropped for the fourth straight month, and

minimal growth in OCDs. Since July, growth in M1 has been consistently

below rates predicted by the Board staff's monthly model (and growth in

the fourth quarter is also much lower than predicted by the quarterly

model), perhaps reflecting some reversal of the unusually strong demands

for M1 that had been evident over the preceding several quarters. A pick-

up in M1 growth appears in store for December, however; based on data for

the first two weeks, growth might be in the neighborhood of 8 percent at

an annual rate this month.

(4) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to

have accelerated a bit in November--to about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate-

as an increase in funds raised by non-federal sectors offset a marked

drop in federal borrowing attributable to the delayed extension of the

federal debt ceiling. Growth in nonfinancial debt is now estimated at

about a 10-1/2 percent annual rate for 1983, well within its 8-1/2 to

11-1/2 percent monitoring range. Credit advanced by commercial banks rose



to a sizable 14 percent annual rate in November, reflecting stepped up

growth in total loans and continued heavy acquisitions of Treasury securi-

ties. Real estate and consumer lending, while moderating somewhat in

November, nevertheless remained strong. Business borrowing from commercial

banks strengthened further in November as commercial paper issuance slack-

ened considerably from the brisk pace of previous months and financing in

long-term debt markets remained light.

(5) Total reserves contracted in November at a 6-1/2 percent

annual rate, as required reserves declined--owing mostly to runoffs of

demand deposits--and nonborrrowed reserves fell even more sharply as the

average level of adjustment borrowing rose. Growth in the monetary

base slowed last month to a 6-1/4 percent pace reflecting mainly the

decline in total reserves, as currency growth was relatively well sus-

tained. Over the intermeeting period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing

ranged from about $440 million to $865 million per week and averaged close

to $685 million, only slightly above the $650 million level assumed in

constructing the weekly nonborrowed reserves paths.

(6) The federal funds rate has continued to average in the 9-1/4

to 9-1/2 percent range since the last FOMC meeting, with most recent

trading around the upper end of that range. Other market interest rates

generally have moved upward amid investor concerns generated by the

stronger-thanexpected economic recovery in the context of continued large

budgetary deficits. Most short-term interest rates increased 30 to 75

basis points over the intermeeting period, while yields on Treasury bonds

increased around 20 basis points. Rates on municipal revenue bonds

jumped almost 40 basis points as issuers rushed to market a flood of

mortgage revenue and other private-purpose bonds, which may be subject to



-5-

new constraints next year. Interest rates on primary conventional mort-

gages were little changed from the November FOMC.

(7) Since the last FOMC meeting the dollar has advanced by

3-1/4 percent on a weighted average basis, surpassing its previous high

reached in August. The dollar dropped slightly on the announcement of a

record trade deficit for October; however, this decline was more than off-

set as the market responded to somewhat higher U.S. interest rates and to

an apparent increase in demand for the dollar as a safe haven in the face

of increasing tension in the Middle East.

U.S. authorities sold $50 million

Background for preliminary consideration of 1984 long-term ranges

(8) This section of the blue book raises issues the Committee

may wish to consider in its preliminary assessment of longer-run money and

credit ranges for next year. At its meeting last July the Committee set

tentative growth ranges for the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter

of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2, 6 to 9 percent for M3, 4 to 8

percent for M1, and 8 to 11 percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial

sectors--which are shown in the table below in relation to the ranges for

1983. For M2, M3 and credit, the 1984 ranges represent a reduction of one-

half percentage point from 1983 ranges,1 while the tentative M1 range

embodies a reduction of 1 full percentage point from the monitoring range

for the second half of 1983. The ranges for 1984 also generally call for

slower growth in the monetary aggregates than experienced either over 1982

or the full year of 1983, although not necessarily slower, in the cases of

Ml and M2, than growth in 1983 from the QII and February-March bases for

these aggregates.

1983 7 to 10* 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 5 to 9* 8-1/2 to 11-1/2

Tentative

* M2 is based on February/March and M1 on QII.

1. It should be noted that the 1983 M2 range of 7 to 10 percent allowed for
some further shifting of funds into MMDAs from outside M2 after March.
Thus, a reduction in the M2 range from 1983 to 1984 by 1/2 point would
not represent a reduction in "effective" terms.



-7-

(9) A reduction in monetary growth, as tentatively contemplated

for next year, would be consistent with continuing progress over time toward

attainment of reasonable price stability, as well as continued economic

recovery. If the ranges, or at least some significant group of them, were

not reduced, this might be viewed by market participants as a weakening in

the System's resolve to contain inflation, especially at a time when fiscal

policy is perceived to be highly stimulative and private spending appears

to be generally strong. However, at some point further reductions in mone-

tary growth rates may no longer be necessary or desirable. What a floor for

monetary growth might be depends importantly on ultimate objectives for

inflation--that is, whether policy strives for complete stability in the

average level of prices or, say, for reasonably small rates of increase (such

as 2 or 3 percent). Resolution of this policy issue requires consideration

of the risk of unacceptable shortfalls in employment and economic growth

that may be involved in the process of attaining price objectives. This

risk is lessened in the degree that nominal wages and prices adapt flexibly

to reductions in monetary growth. And the odds on such flexibility consis-

tent with both satisfactory economic growth and progress toward price

stability may be enhanced if the System is perceived as continuing to

adhere to a policy of restraint on inflation and this reduces expectations

of price increases. The extent to which the Committee may desire ultimately

to reduce money growth would also depend, for a given price objective, on

the trend growth in the velocity of money and the trend growth in producti-

vity and the labor force.

(10) While uncertainties about these technical and economic fac-

tors determining velocity, productivity, and the labor force are vast,

it is probable that the reductions in monetary growth ranges tentatively



-8-

contemplated for next year do not approach the ultimate limit to reductions,

unless price increases on the order of 5 percent are considered acceptable

for the longer run. The question becomes more pressing, however, when mone-

tary growth ranges need to be set for 1985 as well, and more particularly

for the year just beyond. In any event, next year's tentative ranges also

need to be considered in terms of their consistency with continuation of

economic recovery at a satisfactory pace.

(11) With regard to the consistency of the monetary ranges with

continued economic recovery, the midpoints of the tentative ranges for 1984

all imply small to moderate increases in velocity next year, given the staff's

forecast of growth in nominal GNP of around 9 percent. For instance, if M2

expands by about 8 percent or a little more, as assumed by the staff in the

GNP projection, a small increase in velocity would be implied for that aggre-

gate. This would represent a slowdown from the 3 percent pace of velocity

increase for M2 over the last three quarters of 1983 (a period that is

largely free of the effects of shifting into MMDAs which distorted M2 early

in the year). While the experience in earlier cycles may be of limited use-

fulness because of the considerable institutional change affecting M2, such

a slowing in velocity growth is consistent with behavior in the second year

of earlier expansions, when M2 velocity typically decelerated.

(12) In the three economic recoveries since 1960 that lasted at

least two years, the velocity of M1 increased on average by about 2-3/4

percent in the second year of expansion (inclusion of cyclical recoveries

of the 1950s would raise that average to about 3-1/4 percent), with part

of the increase representing a response to rising short-term interest

rates. If interest rates show only minor net changes over next year, as is

anticipated in the staff forecast, it would appear that growth in the upper



half of next year's proposed 4 to 8 percent range for M1 would be consistent,

on historical grounds, with the projected nominal GNP growth for 1984.

However, should demands for goods and services and associated interest

rates be considerably stronger, or weaker, than expected, there could be

substantial implications for the appropriate M1 growth. Rising interest

rates would tend to induce a shift of funds out of NOW accounts with ceiling

rates to other deposits or market instruments; of course, in the degree

that funds shift into super-NOW accounts the demand for M1 would be main-

tained. On the other hand, declining interest rates may bring sizable

funds into NOW accounts as market rates fall toward existing ceiling rates.

(13) Even with the continuing uncertainties about the demand

properties of M1 arising from the institutional changes of recent years,

the Committee may wish to consider whether Ml should be placed on the same

footing as M2 and M3 as a longer-run target rather than being designated

as a "monitoring" variable. The average increase in M1 velocity since the

first quarter and particularly the large rise in the fourth quarter suggests

some unwinding of the large build-up in M1 balances of 1982 and early 1983.

It is possible that a more stable or predictable behavior of M1 velocity may

be in the offing. Moreover, no significant further regulatory changes appear

in prospect for next year. The minimum denomination for super-NOW accounts and

ceiling-free MMDAs is not slated to be reduced to $1,000 until January 1985,

and bills pending in the Congress to remove the prohibition on interest

payments on demand deposits and to allow the Federal Reserve to pay interest

on required reserves seem unlikely to become effective, even if they pass,

next year. If the Committee were to decide to place more emphasis on M1 next

year, the issue might also be raised about whether the range should be narrowed

from the present 4 percentage points to the 2 to 3 percentage points that



-10-

was more characteristic of earlier periods. However, lingering questions

about the stability and structure of M1 demand--including uncertainties

about its interest-elasticity and its longer-run velocity trend-tend to

argue for retention of a relatively wide range.

(14) The debt of nonfinancial sectors in 1984 is likely to grow

in the upper half of its tentative monitoring range of 8 to 11 percent--

which would be more rapid than projected growth in nominal GNP, as is

typical of the second year of earlier recoveries. The debt of private

borrowers is projected to increase at a more than an 8 percent pace, close

to the experience of 1983, as a pick-up in the growth of business debt is

offset by some slowing in borrowing by state and local governments. The

rate of increase in federal indebtedness is anticipated to slow a little in

1984, but federal borrowing should continue to account for not quite 40

percent of funds raised in U.S. credit markets by domestic nonfinancial

borrowers.

(15) Depending in part on how aggressively financial inter-

mediaries seek to accommodate the credit needs of borrowers, M3 could

increase around the upper end of its tentative 6 to 9 percent range in

1984. Growth within the range would entail the slowest expansion of M3

since 1974. While the Committee may wish to consider leaving that range

unaltered from 1983, letting reductions in other ranges carry the message

of continued progress toward reasonable price stability, there are reasons

to believe that some slowing in M3 growth next year from the 9-1/4 pace

estimated for 1983 may develop. Credit growth at both banks and thrifts

may moderate as institutions reduce net acquisitions of Treasury securities

following a period of liquidity rebuilding. Also, as one aspect the large

and growing U.S. current account deficit, banks may continue to find it



-11-

advantageous to fund domestic loans in the Eurodollar market as foreigners

seek to invest their dollars.

Prospective developments

(16) The table below shows alternative specifications for growth

in the monetary aggregates over the November-to-March period (the projected

December levels seem too uncertain to be taken as bases). The associated

federal funds rate ranges for the upcoming intermeeting period and implied

growth rates for each aggregate from the fourth quarter to March are also

shown. (More detailed data for these alternatives can be found on the

charts and table on the following pages.)

(17) Alternative B--which involves continuation of prevailing

bank reserve and money market conditions-contemplates growth in M2 and

M1 that would place these aggregates at around the midpoints of their

tentative longer-run ranges by March. The specified M2 growth of 8 percent

at an annual rate for the November-to-March period would be consistent with

an expected pick-up in M1 growth from the pace of recent months offset by a

slowing in expansion of nontransaction deposits; the latter may have been

boosted to a small extent in October and November by the effects of deposit

rate deregulation. Expansion of M3 is likely to slow somewhat over the

November-to-March period from its average pace since summer, perhaps in-

creasing at a rate a bit below the top of the FOMC's tentative longer-run

range. Credit growth at banks and particularly at thrifts is likely to be

slower in the first quarter than over recent months, working to limit demands

for managed liabilities by depository institutions.

(18) With regard to Ml, it is anticipated that demands for trans-

actions balances by the public will be more in line with spending in coming

months than they have been recently, though held down to some extent by a

bit more unwinding of the earlier large build-up in cash balances. Thus,

M1 would be expected to grow at around a 6 percent average pace in the

first three months of 1984 following a projected increase of around 8 per-

cent in December. Growth of this aggregate on a quarterly average basis

would be around a 6 percent annual rate in the first quarter, implying a

smaller rise in velocity than in the fourth quarter, but a still substantial

4 percent annual rate.

(19) Borrowing at the discount window would be expected to aver-

age around $650 million under alternative B, with federal funds continuing

to trade in a 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent range, probably nearer the upper end

(and possibly a little higher around year-end). With the renewed expansion

of transactions deposits, total reserves would be expected to increase at

about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate through March, and nonborrowed reserves

would rise at a 4-1/2 percent rate.

(20) Interest rates generally would be expected to continue

fluctuating around current levels, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate in

a 9 to 9-1/4 percent range. Some upward pressures on rates could emerge in



-15-

the next few weeks owing to usual year-end churning together with large

Treasury auctions toward the end of the year--including an estimated $14.7

billion of 4- and 7-year notes and 20-year bonds to be auctioned in the so-

called "mini-refunding" in the last week of the month. Any such pressures

may ease off later, however, particularly if incoming economic information

points to a significant slowdown in economic activity in the context of

moderate growth of the monetary aggregates. While long-term market rates

may change little on balance over the intermeeting period, mortgage yields

might rise somewhat in lagged response to earlier increases in market

rates.

(21) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected

to expand in the first quarter at around a 10 percent annual rate, little

different from the fourth quarter. Borrowing by the Federal Government-

which was held down in the fourth quarter as the Treasury financed a sub-

stantial portion of its deficit by drawing on the very large cash balance

it had accumulated by the end of September--is expected to accelerate

somewhat in the months ahead. On the other hand, the growth in the debt of

private nonfinancial borrowers is projected to slow, largely because of

reduced borrowing by households and state and local governments. Corporate

demands on credit markets may pick up as capital spending outpaces the

improvement in profits and internal funds.

(22) Alternative A involves an easing of bank reserve positions-

with borrowing falling to around $400 million and federal funds dropping

to around 9 percent or a little below-that would tend to place M2 and M1 in

the upper halves of their tentative longer-run ranges by March. Over the

period from November to March, these two aggregates would be expected to

grow at annual rates of 8-3/4 and 8 percent, respectively. Growth in M3 may



-16-

exceed the upper end of its tentative longer-term range. Total and nonborrowed

reserves would grow at 4-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent annual rates, respectively,

through March.

(23) An easing in reserve positions such as contemplated by alter-

native A would likely lead to a rally in credit, and perhaps also in equity,

markets. Most recently, market participants have come to anticipate some

tightening in the stance of monetary policy as the economic expansion

continued strong, and a move in the opposite direction would cause a re-

assessment of the near-term outlook for interest rates. Treasury bill rates

might fall into an 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent range. Bond yields could decline

by a one-half percentage point or so, forestalling any rise in mortgage

rates and perhaps inducing further declines. The dollar would decline on

foreign exchange markets.

(24) The staff's economic forecast anticipates very little change

in interest rates over the course of 1984. In the degree that an easing

in market conditions over the month ahead contributes to additional strength

in economic activity and associated money demands as the year progresses,

a tightening of reserve provision and increases in money market rates later

next year--possibly to levels above those currently prevailing--may be neces-

sary to constrain money to the tentative long-run ranges.

(25) Under alternative C, growth in M2 would be constrained to

the lower half of its longer-run range. This would probably be associated

with M1 near the lower limit of its range, while M3 would be held comfortably

within the upper part of its range. Assuming M2 growth from November to March

of 7-1/4 percent and M1 growth of 5 percent, the tightening in money market

conditions expected under this alternative may involve discount window



-17-

borrowing rising to near $1 billion and the federal funds rate rising to 10

percent or a little above.

(26) The tightening in bank reserve positions under alter-

native C would be larger than now apparently anticipated by the market. As

a consequence interest rates would increase substantially, with Treasury

bill rates moving up into a 9-1/4 to 9-3/4 percent range, and the dollar

would move even higher on foreign exchange markets. CD rates would rise

toward 10-1/2 percent, calling into question the current 11 percent prime

rate. Rates on the CDs of some banks might come under particular upward

pressure if the general movement of interest rates intensified concerns

about international debt burdens. Any upward response of bond yields,

however, might on balance be somewhat muted, if the firming in money markets

was viewed as increasing the odds on a significant slowing in the economic

expansion. Indeed, if economic expansion slowed as the year progresses to

a pace below, say, the staff's current forecast, interest rates would

probably need to decline later to maintain money growth at a satisfactory

pace.

Directive language

(27) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive, with proposed deletions of language adopted at the meeting on

November 14-15, 1983 shown in strike-through form. The references to

the consistency between short-run and longer-run targets are suggested

to be deleted since the ranges for 1984 are only tentative and subject

to final determination at the February meeting.

The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain /INCREASE

SLIGHTLY/DECREASE SLIGHTLY the existing degree of reserve restraint.

The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at

annual rates of around [DEL:8-1/2] ____ AND ____ percent RESPECTIVELY from

[DEL: September to December] NOVEMBER TO MARCH, [DEL: consistent with the

targets estabished for these aggregates for the year.] Depending

on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery

and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook,

somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggre-

gates expand more rapidly; lesser restraint might be acceptable

in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of the

aggregates from current expectations. [DEL: Given the relatively slow

growth in Qctober,] The Committee anticipates that M1 growth at

an annual rate of around [DEL: 5 to 6] ____ percent from [DEL: September to

December] NOVEMBER TO MARCH will be consistent with its [DEL: fourth

quarter] objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion

in total domestic nonfinancial debt would [DEL: remain within the

range established for the year] CONTINUE AT AROUND ITS RECENT

PACE. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it

appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of



-19-

the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the

period before the next meeting is likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of

[DEL: 6-to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.
