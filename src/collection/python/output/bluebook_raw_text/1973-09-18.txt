Recent developments

(1) RPD's now appear to be growing around the mid-point of the

Committee's August-September range of tolerance, but M1 appears to be well

below and M2 is near the bottom of their respective ranges, as the table

shows. In August the narrowly defined money supply experienced a small

contraction instead of expanding slightly as projected, and growth of M2

at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate was also substantially short of expecta-

tions. The smaller shortfall from target for M2 as compared with M1

reflects the continuing expansion in consumer-type time deposits, particu-

larly the 4-year wild card accounts. The fact that RPD's are growing around

the mid-point of their range of tolerance, even though the money supply

aggregates are low, stems from the Committee's decision to reduce (by two

per centage points) the whole range of tolerance for RPD's relative to

that shown in the Bluebook for alternative B, while dropping (by just one

per centage point) only the low ends of the ranges for M1 and M2 .

(2) Early in the intermeeting period RPD's and the money supply

aggregates all appeared to be expanding at annual rates close to or above

the upper limits of the Committee's August-September ranges of tolerance.

By the end of August, although growth of M1 and M2 appeared to be slipping

to annual rates close to or below the low ends of their ranges, RPD's

continued to grow at a rate near the top of theirs. In view of the emphasis

on RPD's at the last meeting, the Account Manager adopted a reserve supplying

strategy early in the period under which the Federal funds rate was expected

to move up toward the top of the Committee's 10-11 per cent rate range. Later,

however, RPD growth moved down into the Committee's range of tolerance, and

the monetary aggregates weakened further. Accordingly, the Desk did not

continue to press for progressively firmer conditions of reserve availability.

The Federal funds rate has averaged around 10-3/4 per cent since late August.

(3) Yields on intermediate and long-term securities trended down-

ward during most of the intermeeting period, substantially extending the

market rally begun before the last meeting, as market participants began

to believe that the maximum degree of monetary restraint had been reached.

Declines ranged to around 30 basis points on both municipal and Treasury

issues, and to about 35 basis points on new corporate bonds. A further

increase in the prime rate to 9-3/4 per cent on August 27, had little

dampening impact on this downtrend. At the same time, the general market

improvement facilitated sale of a $2 billion Treasury note on August 24 and

of a sizable volume of new Federal agency issues during late August and early



September. Most recently, however, the bond market rally has ended, and

some yields have risen, as the money market continued taut and the Board took

action on September 7 raising marginal reserve requirements on large CD's.

In the last two days, a number of banks raised the prime rate to 10 per cent.

(4) In contrast to bond yields, rates on home mortgages continued

to rise during the intermeeting period. The increase in FNMA auction yields

amounted to 32 basis points. Continued upward pressure on mortgage rates is

hardly surprising in view of the large further attrition in savings accounts

at non-bank thrift institutions during August, and the resulting continuing

low volume of new mortgage commitments.

(5) Currently, most short rates are close to or at new highs,

The only short rates that showed significant declines within the intermeeting

period were those on Treasury bills and Federal agency securities, and even

these declines proved to be temporary. The 90-day Treasury bill rate, for

example, dropped below 8.50 per cent shortly after the last meeting, then

rose to a new high of more than 9 per cent and most recently has traded

around 8.80 per cent. Over the full intermeeting period, private short-term

rates have posted further advances ranging generally from 1/8 to 1/4 of a

percentage point.

(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time

periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Given the recent weakness in money supply and the continued

high level of interest rates, it now appears that the long-run target path

for M1 initially adopted by the Committee last March and reaffirmed at recent

meetings cannot be attained by the end of this year without an abrupt and

very large decline in interest rates. If current money market conditions

are maintained over the next several months, the staff would expect M 1 growth

in the fourth quarter to be around 2-1/2 per cent at an annual rate. Such

a growth rate would lead to a level of M1 that is some $2.5 billion below

the December level implicit in the 5-1/4 per cent long-run path line adopted

by the Committee. This path, extended to March 1974, is shown in the chart

on the following page.

(8) The assumption of unchanged money market conditions is

incorporated in the specifications presented here as alternative C. This

alternative includes a growth rate for M1 over the fourth and first quarters

combined of about 3 per cent. The levels of M1 that would be reached in the

final months of each of these quarters under this alternative are shown on

the chart by the dots labelled "C". As will be noted from the chart, the

shortfall from path would be expected to widen further in the first quarter.

Specifications for this and other alternatives are summarized in the following

table and spelled out more fully in the table on page 6a.

(9) Alternative A specifications include a 6-month growth rate for

M I of 6 per cent, the rate required to reach the longer-run 5-1/4 per cent path

by March. This pattern is illustrated by the dots labelled "A" on the chart.

To compensate for the cumulative restraining impact on money supply of recent

high interest rates, this alternative implies a decline in the Federal funds

rate, with an initial drop over the next few weeks to a level possibly as low

as 8-1/2--9 per cent. Given the lagged relationship between money demand and

interest rates, the longer that shortfalls in monetary aggregates continue, the

sharper the decline in interest rates that would be needed to bring the

aggregates back on path within any specific period. Accordingly, significant

delays in permitting greater reserve availability would increase the risk

that a return to the 5-1/4 per cent path by the end of the first quarter would

require easing to a degree that might lead to a subsequent unduly sharp expansion

in money.

(10) Alternative B falls in between A and C in terms of growth in

the aggregates. It also implies a smaller drop in interest rates than does

alternative A. The 6-month growth rate for M1 under this alternative is

around 4-1/2 per cent at an annual rate. Thus, like C, it would represent

a path that falls short of the Committee's previous long-run target, but

of course the shortfall is less.

(11) The short-run September-October growth rate in RPD's is

very large under these alternatives, ranging around 16 per cent at an annual

rate. About half of this rapid growth rate is attributable to expected

behavior of CD's and non-deposit sources of funds (including about 3-1/2

percentage points that reflect the impact of the two marginal reserve actions).

Only about 2 percentage points of the growth reflects expected expansion in

private demand deposits, as only a slight increase is indicated for M1 in

September-October, while 4-1/2 percentage points are accounted for by

expansion in time and savings deposits other than large CD's.

If the Committee were to decide to permit money market conditions

to ease significantly over the next few weeks--e.g. a Fed funds rate below

10-1/2 per cent and clearly moving down--market expectations would be

strongly influenced. A substantial decline in short-term interest rates

would probably be set in motion. And long-term rates would also drop, though

perhaps not as much as short rates, in view of the still wide spread of



-8-

short- over long-rates and given the downward adjustment that has already

taken place in long rates in recent weeks. If, on the other hand, money

market conditions remained about unchanged from those recently prevailing,

short-term rates could be expected to advance somewhat further as seasonal

pressures build up during the fall. Long-term rates would probably also

regain part of their recent declines.

(13) Given the money market conditions of alternative C--indicated

by a Federal funds rate in a 10 to 11 per cent range--growth in consumer-type

time and savings deposits at banks would be expected to slow noticeably as

the realignment of consumer financial asset holdings to the new rate structure

tapers. M2 under alternative C may be expected to rise at about a 5-1/2 per

cent annual rate in the September-October period. The market interest rates

decline envisaged under alternative A and B would lead to greater growth in

consumer-type time deposits than under C and hence to somewhat greater growth

in M2 . Nonbank thrift institutions are expected to remain under pressure in

the months ahead, assuming no change in money market conditions, but the

pressures would moderate a little once the most interest-sensitive depositors

have shifted out. The position of thrift institutions would ease, of course,

as market interest rates decline under alternatives A and B.

(14) Business loan demand at banks is expected to continue relatively

strong over the months ahead, accmpanied by bank demand for money market funds.

However, bank issuance of CD's should be tempered by the new marginal reserve

requirement, although some bank demand will shift toward Euro-dollars and

inter-bank loans. And bank credit growth is expected to moderate over the

coming months from the exceptionally rapid August pace.



Proposed directive language

(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to cor-

respond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to delete

the word "immediately" from the phrase "over the months immediately

ahead" to avoid any implication that the Committee seeks to achieve

the aggregate growth rates described within a very few months. As

will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth rates in the

aggregates "thus far this year." For the period through August, these

are as follows: M1, 5 per cent; M2 , 7-1/2 per cent; and the bank

credit proxy, 14 per cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

international and domestic financial market developments

[DEL: and the forthcoming Treasury financing], the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with SOMEWHAT MORE RAPID [DEL: slower] growth in mone-

tary aggregates over the months [DEL: immediately] ahead than has

occurred on average thus far this year.



-10-

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

international and domestic financial market developments

[DEL: an the forthcoming Treasury financing], the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with [DEL: slower] MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates

over the months [DEL: immediately] ahead [DEL: than has occurred on

average thus far this year].

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

international and domestic financial market developments

[DEL: and the forthcoming Treasury financing], the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with slower growth in monetary aggregates over

the months [DEL: immediately] ahead than has occurred on average

thus far this year.

Notes: Government Security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agree-
ments maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt
issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Fed-
eral funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday
figures.

**Beginning with January 1973, monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
