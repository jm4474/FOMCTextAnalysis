The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Recent developments

(1) Growth rates for the monetary aggregates during the fourth

quarter of 1979 consistent with the decision by the FOMC at its meeting

on October 6 are shown in the first and second columns of the table

below. Such growth rates, if attained, would keep expansion in the

aggregates over the year from QIV '78 to QIV '79 within the Committee's

desired longer-run ranges, as shown in columns three and four of the table.

The fourth quarter growth rates, in combination with growth over the first

nine months of the year (shown in column five), would imply rates of expansion

for M-1 and M-3 in the upper halves of their longer-run growth ranges, and for

M-2 at the top of its range.

adjusted upward by staff's estimate that ATS effects will reduce

measured M-1 growth by about 1½ percentage points over the longer-run

policy period rather than the 3 percentage points originally estimated

in February.



(2) The growth rates from September to December in the family

of reserve aggregates needed to attain the Committee's monetary aggregate

objectives were estimated by the staff immediately following the FOMC's

October 6 meeting and took account of the Committee's decision to "bias"

the paths, especially for nonborrowed reserves, toward an immediate tightening

of the money market. These estimates assumed: (a) an increase in M-1,

seasonally adjusted,at a steady rate month-by-month (a pattern of money

supply that was roughly consistent with our projected pattern of money

demand); (b) continuation of the recent patterns of deposit mix; (c) excess

reserves averaging $200 million; and (d) for purposes of deriving the non-

borrowed path, an increase in the initially contemplated average level of member

bank borrowings to $1.5 billion from the September average of $1.3 billion.

Of course, the actual level of borrowing and money market conditions would

depend on the demand for reserves relative to the nonborrowed reserves

supplied through the open market desk.

(3) As shown in the table below, growth rates in the monetary

aggregates, and in the family of reserve measures, since September have

generally decelerated from the pace of the preceding three months.1/ Non-

borrowed reserves increased by about a 2¼ percent annual rate from

September to the first half of November, slower than the pace given by the

fourth quarter path. On the other hand, total reserves expanded at about an

1/ Data are expressed as annual rates of growth. This, it should be

recognized, particularly exaggerates swings in the reserve series where

relatively modest changes in borrowings, excess reserves, or deposit mix

can lead to large percentage changes in nonborrowed or total reserves
because the level of the series is relatively small.



11-1/2 percent annual rate over this period, a bit above path. At the same

time, growth in M-2 has been about equal to path, while growth in M-1 has
1/

been running low. Expansion in the broader aggregates has been almost

wholly dependent on growth in money market certificates and large CD's,

as the outstanding amount of savings deposits at banks and thrift insti-

tutions declined sharply in the wake of the run-up of interest rates.

aggregates and bank credit in longer-run perspective.)

first full statement week after the Committee's decision. However, over the

demand for excess reserves.

first half of October, all aggregate reserve measures were running well

above path, partly in consequence of stronger demands for reserves than

expected and partly because the Desk adjusted its operations to take account

of the unsettled conditions in financial markets. During the second half of

the month, Desk operations were directed more firmly at holding nonborrowed

reserve growth to path levels, or somewhat below, in view of the continued

strength of total reserves. Operations were accompanied by a sharp rise in

the federal funds rate and in member bank borrowings. By the last week of

October, the average federal funds rate had increased to about 15½ percent

and member bank borrowings to around $3 billion. Both the funds rate and

member bank borrowing dropped back in the first half of November, to around

13½ percent and $2 billion, respectively, as banks' demand for reserves eased.

(5) Short-term market interest rates have risen sharply on balance

since the System's October 6 announcement. Treasury bill rates--which have

displayed a good deal of volatility in response to shifting pressures in the

federal funds market and to unexpected changes in bill supplies--have increased

on balance by about 1 to 1-3/8 percentage points. Rates on private short-term

instruments have generally posted larger gains--in the 1-3/8 to 1¾ percentage

point range.



(6) Long-term yields, too, have moved higher since early October.

Yields on Treasury bonds show net gains of about one percentage point; those

on corporate and municipal bonds registered increases of about 1¼ percentage

points and 5/8 percentage points, respectively. The sharp rise in rates,together

with the generally turbulent market conditions and the cautious attitudes

of underwriters, resulted in the postponement or cancellation by both corporate

and municipal borrowers of a comparatively large number of debt offerings,

especially by lower-rated borrowers. In its mid-quarter financing the

Treasury decided to offer a standard package of issues--a 3½-year note,

a 10-year note and a 30-year bond--to raise $1.4 billion of new money

and refinance $4.6 billion of maturing debt. Record yields (for given

maturities) were set on all three issues.

(7) Expansion of both loans and investments at commercial banks

slowed substantially in October. Security loans declined sharply, as

security holdings by dealers fell in reaction to uncertain market conditions,

declining security prices, and sharply rising borrowing costs. Growth in

business loans (net of holdings of acceptances) moderated somewhat from the

recent rapid pace, while real estate lending remained strong. With

demand and savings deposits declining, banks financed loan growth for the

most part by issuing.money market certificates and large CD's, offering

repurchase agreements, and liquidating bankers acceptances.

(8) Conditions in mortgage markets tightened markedly in response

not only to the general rise in interest rates, but also to pressures on

deposit inflows at thrifts and to problems caused by interest rate ceilings.

S&Ls were reported to have sharply curtailed their mortgage commitment

activity after October 6. The average interest rate on new commitments



at S&Ls rose around 1 percentage points to 12.85 percent, a rate

exceeding usury ceilings in 20 states. Secondary market rates also rose

rapidly, and the volume of offerings at FNMA auctions surged.

(9) The foreign exchange value of the dollar rebounded on

average following the October 6 measures, with the weighted average value

of the dollar having risen by nearly 3 percent through November 13, just

prior to announcements concerning the disposition of official Iranian

assets. Improvement over this period was most substantial against the

yen, which declined by about 9 percent against the dollar. The dollar rose

only 2 percent against the DM.

. Most recently, in the wake of the Iranian situation, the value

of the dollar has retraced some of its earlier gains.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows

over various time periods.

Prospective developments

(11) At its last meeting, the Committee decided on a target

rate of growth in M-1 from September to December on the order of 4 percent,

associated with growth in M-2 of about 7½ percent. The Committee also

indicated that somewhat slower rates of growth were acceptable. Of the

alternatives shown below for Committee consideration, alternative B involves

a November-December growth rate for M-1 that achieves a 4½ percent rate of

expansion from September to December, but with an accompanying M-2 growth

above the Committee's earlier target. Alternative C is based on a lower

M-1 growth rate, and includes an M-2 growth closer to, though still above,

the Committee's earlier objective. Alternative A involves more rapid growth

in the aggregates. Because only six weeks are left before the end of the

year, monetary growth rates for the year 1979 may not be substantially

affected by alternative policy courses, although these policies would

have an immediate influence on credit conditions and on the trajectory

of monetary growth entering the new year. (The tables on pp. 9 and 10

show more detailed figures, including growth rates for the year).

(12) Alternative B involves acceleration in money growth rates

over the balance of the year from their recent pace, with M-1 expanding

at a 5 percent annual rate on average in November and December and M-2

at a 9 percent rate. Since the latest data suggest that M-1 in mid-

November is quite low relative to path, a considerable spurt of M-1 growth

in the last half of November and in December is needed to achieve the

objective in this alternative. This would probably be reflected mainly

in a rapid December growth rate.

(13) The staff would expect that expansion in the aggregates

as specified under alternative B could be attained by growth (at annual

rates) in the family of reserve measures over November and December as

follows: monetary base, 7 percent; total reserves,7 percent; and non-

borrowed reserves, 15 percent. For purposes of constructing the nonborrowed

reserve path, given the current discount rate, member bank borrowings

were assumed to average $1 billion, the same initial assumption as

adopted by the Committee in early October.

(14) The increase in M-1 targeted over the balance of the quarter

is consistent with the expected transactions demand for money over the

fourth quarter as a whole, given the GNP projections. The federal funds

rate under this alternative probably would be around the 13 percent level

early in the period and it might go a bit lower as the period progresses.

If bearish economic news tends to cumulate, interest rates generally might

drop rather substantially and in practice there may also be some sympathetic

further downward pressure on the funds rate. But any drop in market rates

in general, and concomitant decline in the federal funds rate, would tend

to be more sustained and deeper if economic activity and/or demand for

money in the fourth quarter were substantially weaker than the staff

has projected. On the other hand, of course, a stronger pace of



-12-

economic activity and/or inflation than is being projected would probably

be associated with strengthening money demand, stronger bank credit demands,

and renewed upward pressures on the funds rate.

(15) Bank credit growth is likely to remain near its recent

reduced pace over the weeks ahead, with business loan growth at a more

moderate pace as inventory growth slows further, with consumer loan

growth remaining at a reduced pace in view of already high debt burdens

and the extended decline in real personal income, and with real estate

loan growth beginning to slack off as housing demand weakens. Bank

acquisitions of securities could pick up, however, especially if the

market becomes even more convinced that the peak in interest rates for

this cycle has been reached.

(16) Pressures on thrift institutions are unlikely to ease over

the next few weeks under alternative B. However, if the funds rate drops

a little, and corporate bond yields do decline, mortgage rates could edge

off. A stabilized market atmosphere would make thrift institutions less

hesitant to commit funds to the mortgage market. It is not likely,

though, that mortgage market conditions will improve markedly unless

short-term market rates drop significantly and/or adjustments favorable

to thrift institutions are made in deposit ceiling rates.

(17) The specifications of alternative C involve slower growth

in the monetary aggregates than alternative B, as indicated in the table

in paragraph (11). Such growth rates would be consistent with expansion

in the monetary base and total reserves over November-December at annual

rates of 7 and 6 percent, respectively. Given the expected demand for

money, this alternative is likely to be associated with either no change

or some rise in market rates. On the assumption that adoption of this



-13-

alternative would mean that the Committee desires greater assurance that

growth rates for the aggregates will not be excessive, the upper limit of

the proposed funds rate range has been raised slightly from that of

alternative B. Consistent with such an approach, the nonborrowed reserve

path for this alternative has been constructed on the assumption that

borrowings average a shade under $2 billion, implying growth in nonborrowed

reserves of around 8¾ percent over November and December--considerably

less than the alternative B pace. The funds rate initially would probably

be around 13 percent, or a bit higher, given the present discount rate. If

the discount rate were raised, in light of a continuing relatively wide gap

between the discount and federal funds rates, additional nonborrowed reserves

would have to be provided unless the Committee wished to tolerate further

upward pressures on market rates--a decision that might depend in part

on the behavior at the time of monetary aggregates, total reserves, and

the monetary base.

(18) Adoption of alternative C would probably lead to some

rebound in market interest rates, as expectations that interest rates had

already peaked were disappointed. Pressures on thrift institutions would

be somewhat more intense than under alternative B, mortgage rates would

probably rise a little further, and the bank prime rate would also be under

further upward pressure. Any increase of interest rates might be quite modest

in magnitude and short-lived, however, if business news were adverse.

Nevertheless, the higher rate levels than under alternative B would tend

to hold down money demanded in early 1980, implying a decline of

interest rates early in the new year if the Committee wishes to provide



-14-

the reserves needed to keep M-1 in the first quarter of next year on the

midpoint of its longer-run growth path--assumed for these purposes to be

a 6 percent rate of growth.1/

(19) Provision of reserves needed to attain the specifications

for the monetary aggregates presented under alternative A would appear

to involve an easing in money market conditions. The growth in the

monetary base and total reserves over November and December implied by

that alternative--at 7¾ and 7½ percent, annual rates, respectively--are

only slightly more rapid than under alternative B. However, growth in

nonborrowed reserves, at over a 20 percent annual rate, would be con-

siderably more rapid. Such growth is consistent with an initial decline

in the funds rate to around 12 percent and a drop in member bank borrowing

to around $1 billion or so, given the prevailing 12 percent discount rate.

The funds rate range proposed for this alternative is 10½ to 15½ percent,

involving a reduction in the lower limit as compared with alternative B.

(20) The approach to open market operations of alternative A

would exert considerably downward pressure on market interest rates generally

as more and more participants came to believe rates had peaked. This decline

of interest rates would ease cost pressures on banks and thrift institutions,

but would not, given present ceiling rates, substantially increase deposit

flows to thrifts, relative to alternative B, even if the funds rate began to

approach its 10½ percent alternative A lower limit.

1/ The Committee at its July meeting decided that growth of the aggregates
in 1980 would be within the same ranges as for 1979, although with
certain qualifications for changing economic conditions and institutional
changes. The 1979 range of 1½ to 4½ percent for M-1 assumed that ATS
effects would depress M-1 growth by 3 percentage points. It now appears
that ATS effects will be negligible in 1980, implying a 4½ to 7½ percent
M-1 range, centering on 6 percent.



-15-

(21) The monetary aggregates targeted over the last two months

of the year under alternative A would not lead to growth in the monetary

aggregates for the year 1979 very much different from that of alternative B,

but the lower interest rates associated with this alternative might tend to

moderate the expected recession in economic activity and tend to increase

the quantity of money demanded in early 1980. A reasonable implication

of this alternative, therefore, might be a policy in early 1980 that supplied

somewhat more reserves and money than consistent with the assumed 6 percent

midpoint of the Committee's longer-term target for 1980. Such a policy

early next year would, in turn, imply the need for more constraint on

money growth as the year progressed.

(22) With regard to effects of monetary policy choices on exchange

markets, some decline of interest rates here might lead to downward pressures

on the exchange value of the dollar, but such pressures probably would not

be significant unless the decline in interest rates were substantial and

accompanied by an acceleration of inflation or of the monetary aggregates.

A rise of interest rates here may help the dollar on exchange markets, but

any tendency for the dollar to rise would be limited to the extent that

other countries raised interest rates or moderated, through exchange market

intervention, declines in the value of their own currencies. Of course,

exchange market developments over the near-term may be most affected by

further economic and political developments in the Middle East.

Directive language

(23) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at

the meeting on October 6. It calls for restraining expansion of

reserve aggregates to a pace consistent with the desired rates of growth

in M-1, M-2, and M-3 in the fourth quarter of 1979, provided that the

federal funds rate on a weekly average basis remains within a specified

range. The range for the funds rate adopted on October 6 is shown in

strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to restrain expansion

of reserve aggregates to a pace consistent with deceleration in

growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 in the fourth quarter of 1979 to rates

that would hold growth of these monetary aggregates over the whole

period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of

1979 within the Committee's longer-run ranges, provided that

in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average

federal funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 11½ to 15½] ____ TO

____ percent. [DEL: The Committee will consider the need for

sypplementary-instructions if it appears that operations to

restrain expansion of reserve aggregates would maintain the

federal funds rate near the upper limit of its range.]

IF IT APPEARS DURING THE PERIOD BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING THAT

THE CONSTRAINT ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE

OBJECTIVE FOR THE EXPANSION OF RESERVES, THE MANAGER FOR DOMESTIC

OPERATIONS IS PROMPTLY TO NOTIFY THE CHAIRMAN WHO WILL THEN DECIDE

WHETHER THE SITUATION CALLS FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INSTRUCTIONS FROM

THE COMMITTEE.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions
of 6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. For columns 8 through 11, the weekly date is the mid-point of
the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement
week, Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample
of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end
of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly
auction for short-term forward commitments for government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securties
for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA
ceiling.
