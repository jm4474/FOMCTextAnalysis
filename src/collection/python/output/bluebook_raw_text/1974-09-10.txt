Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at an annual rate of about 3.0 per cent in August,

somewhat above the very low July rate but short of the 4.7 per cent

indicated at the last Committee meeting. Fragmentary data for early

September suggest that a sizable shortfall is continuing. As a result,

M 1 growth for August and September combined now appears to be running at

only a 2.6 per cent annual rate, below the low end of the Committee's

range of tolerance, as shown in the table, while growth of M2 is close to

the low end of its range.

(2) As evidence of weakness in the aggregates emerged, the

Account Management supplied reserves more readily, expecting the Federal

funds rate to move into the lower half of the Committee's 11½-12½ per cent

range of tolerance. The funds rate averaged 11.84 per cent and 11.64 per

cent, respectively, in the 2 full statement weeks since the last meeting.

Member banks showed a greater willingness to borrow in this period, and

borrowings (apart from Franklin) averaged $2.2 billion, up about $400 million

from the average in the previous four weeks.

(3) Net changes in short-term interest rates have been relatively

minor since the last Committee meeting, although quotes on both Treasury

bills and large bank CD's have moved over a rather wide range. Bill rates

rose sharply early in the period, with the bid quote on the 3-month issue

moving to a record 9¾ per cent, as the Treasury was in process of raising

a sizable amount of new cash through additions to the supply of bills.

Subsequently, with the Federal funds rate continuing to edge lower, bill

rates turned down again, and most recently, the 3-month issue has traded

around 9.25 per cent. Bank CD rates also moved up early in the inter-

meeting period when a number of institutions were seeking to expand CD

volume in anticipation of large September maturities, but since then they

have dropped to levels close to those prevailing at the time of the last

meeting. Announcement on September 4 of the Board action eliminating the

3 per cent marginal reserve requirement on large longer maturity bank CD's

was interpreted by the market as evidence that monetary policy has become

slightly less restrictive.

(4) Long-term debt markets remained under pressure during

most of the inter-meeting period, with yields in most areas tending to

edge a little higher. Contributing to this pressure were large current

and prospective borrowings by Government sponsored agencies that support



housing. While some renewed problems developed in the placement and

distribution of new corporate and municipal security issues, the degree

of difficulty appears to be less than in early July. Mortgage rates

continued to rise, as deposit inflows to thrift institutions were severely

constrained.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates

computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-

of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in appendix

table IV for the three alternatives presented in the next section.

(6) Summarized below for Committee consideration are three

alternative policy courses, with more detail presented in the table on

the following page.

(7) The alternative longer-run targets for growth rates in the

aggregates cover a seven-month period that encompasses the balance of

1974 (September and the fourth quarter) and the first quarter of 1975.

It was assumed that the Committee would wish to continue looking ahead

about two quarters in establishing its longer-run targets. However, at

this time, if the targeted growth rates covered only the fourth and first

quarters, they would be based on September levels that are almost wholly

projected and subject to very considerable error since there are virtually

no hard data yet available for that month. Since the August figures

would provide a more reliable base, the alternative longer-run targets

are shown for a seven-month period including September. As may be seen

from the chart on the following page, the level of M1 in August reflects

a 5.2 per cent annual rate of growth thus far this year; since this is

reasonably consistent with recent Committee desires, the August level is

not unreasonable as a base for formulating longer-run targets.

(8) Alternative C involves a 5¼ per cent growth rate for

M1 over the target period and assumes money market conditions about

unchanged from those recently prevailing. Because of the shortfalls

in M1 in July and August, such a growth rate measured from August would

imply lower levels of M1 in coming months than were implicit in the

longer-run target (of 5¼ per cent for the second half of 1974) that

was adopted at the August Committee meeting. Alternative B con-

templates a 5¾ per cent growth rate for M1 from now on. Such a growth

rate would compensate for recent shortfalls by early spring of next

year--i.e., by early spring of 1975, the rate of increase in M1

measured from mid-1974 would be around 5¼ per cent. The more rapid

6½ per cent growth rate for M1 contemplated under alternative A would

almost make up for the recent shortfall by year-end.

(9) The 5¼ per cent growth path for M1 of alternative C

is expected to be consistent with a Federal funds rate range centering

on 11¾ per cent, which is close to the rate that has prevailed on

average since the last meeting. Over the two month September-October

period M 1 growth would be expected to be in a 2¾-4¾ per cent, annual

rate, range. The expectation of a continued relatively low growth

rate over the near-term in part reflects the weakness in the fragmentary

information thus far available for the early days of September, a

period when a substantial recovery in growth had earlier been expected.

M 1 growth is projected to pick up in October, with growth more rapid

over the fourth quarter as a whole, since transactions demands for

cash are assumed to strengthen if the staff forecast for about a

7 per cent annual rate of growth in nominal GNP is realized.

(10) With money market conditions assumed to be essentially

unchanged under this alternative, little further net change in market

interest rates generally would be expected between now and the next

Committee meeting. The volume of new issues expected in corporate and

municipal bond markets is fairly heavy over the week immediately ahead,

but no new Treasury cash borrowing is anticipated until later in the

year. In the mortgage market, rates have already adjusted upward sub-

stantially, and reduced demands for mortgage credit may limit further



-8-

upward rate adjustments. However, the spread between corporate bond

yields and mortgages is still unfavorable to the latter, and high short-

term market interest rates would be expected to continue diverting

savings from banks and thrift institutions to market instruments.

(11) Given the market interest rates assumed under alternative

C, growth in savings deposits at thrift institutions would be expected

to remain barely positive, while net inflows of time deposits other than

money market CD's to banks would be expected to expand at a modest pace.

Banks have reduced reliance on money market CD's recently, and growth

in these instruments over the months ahead would probably be slower

than earlier in the year as bank loan growth is projected to abate some-

what. The reduced rate of expansion in economic activity is likely to

temper bank credit demands, although the needs of borrowers under

liquidity pressure could remain substantial. The recent Board action

to remove the marginal reserve requirement on large time deposits

maturing in four months or more is assumed to have a marginal effect

on the structure of CD's issued by banks, but to have an insignificant

effect on the total amount of CD's issued.

(12) Adoption of the somewhat higher 5¾ per cent growth rate

of alternative B would be expected to entail a further decline in the



-9-

Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to around 11 per cent, the center

of the 10-12 per cent range shown for this alternative. Growth of M1 in the

September-October period in a 3¼-5¼ per cent annual rate range might be

anticipated. Growth over the fourth and first quarters would be con-

siderably higher--around 6-6 per cent, annual rate--to compensate for

the marked weakness expected in September. The stimulative impact of

the easing in money market conditions on money demand would be felt mainly

in the fourth and first quarters; subsequently growth in M1 could be

expected to drop back to around the 5¾ per cent rate.

(13) If the funds rate were to decline to 11 per cent over

the next few weeks, other rates would be likely to decline rather sharply

on expectational grounds. Rate declines would probably be larger than

justified by the stance of monetary policy and the likely strength of

credit demands, if our nominal GNP forecast is correct. Thus interest

rates would probably readjust upward to some degree as time goes on.

Between now and the next Committee meeting the 3-month bill rate would

be mostly in a 7¾-8¾ per cent range. A very modest recovery in savings

flows at banks and thrift institutions might develop, and mortgage

market rates would be under less pressure.

(14) Alternative A presents a more expansive policy alternative,

characterized by a 6 per cent long-run rate of growth in M1 and a

greater near-term decline in the Federal funds rate. Expectational effects

on markets would be quite strong, and market interest rates generally

could be expected to decline rather sharply. Improvement in the position

of thrift institutions would be rather marked, and mortgage rates, after



-10-

some time, may begin to decline. Banks could expand CD offerings over

the near-term to obtain funds for investment in longer-term market

securities while high yields on the securities are still available.

(15) It was assumed in the preceding discussion that if the

Committee adopts alternative B or A, it would want to have the money

market conditions expected to be consistent with the higher growth

rates for M1 established between now and the next meeting. However, the

Committee may wish to phase in any easing of market conditions over a

longer period, particularly under alternative A. Thus, the funds rate

could be permitted to decline in the inter-meeting period by less than

implied by the mid-points of the ranges shown in the summary table of

paragraph (6), in the expectation that some further decline would be

sought later. If staff estimates of relationships between interest

rates and monetary aggregates are correct, however, under such a pro-

cedure achievement of the indicated targets for the aggregates would

require a somewhat larger total decline in the funds rate than if the

move were accomplished quickly. For example, under alternative A, a

drop in the funds rate to 10¾ per cent over the next five weeks, followed

by a further decline to around 10 per cent by mid-November, could be

envisaged.

Proposed directive

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. As will be noted, alternative A refers to the

rate of growth in monetary aggregates "over recent months." Over the

second quarter and the first 2 months of the third quarter, growth rates

were 4.8 and 7.1 per cent for M1 and M2, respectively.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with A HIGHER RATE OF [DEL: moderate] growth in

monetary aggregates [DEL: over the months ahead] THAN HAS PREVAILED

OVER RECENT MONTHS.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates

over the months ahead.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with MODEST [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOtS: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agreements
maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt issues
still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds
purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.
