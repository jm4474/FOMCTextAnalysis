The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at a 14.5 per cent annual rate in October, after

remaining essentially unchanged in September. In November M1 growth

appears to be moderating significantly, however, and for the October-

November period it is now projected at a 9.5 per cent annual rate--some-

what above the upper end of the Committee's 5-9 per cent operating range.

With time and savings deposit inflows at commercial banks also running

stronger than anticipated, M2 is expected to grow at a 14.1 per cent annual

rate in the October-November period, also above the upper limit of its

2-month range. Growth of deposits at nonbank thrift institutions also

remained rapid during October, though less so than in the third quarter.

As a result of the increased demand for reserves associated with the

strength in demand and time deposits, nonborrowed reserves appear to be

increasing at an 8.7 per cent annual rate in the October-November period--

a considerably more rapid pace than over the preceding months of the

1/
year.-

1/ Appendix A contains a discussion of the actual behavior of
nonborrowed reserves in the weeks between the October and November
meetings relative to the behavior that was expected to be con-
sistent with the Committee's short-run ranges for monetary growth.

(2) Shortly after the October FOMC meeting, incoming data

suggested that growth in M1 and M2 would be at the upper limits of the

Committee's ranges. In these circumstances it appeared likely that the

immediate reduction in the funds rate objective contemplated by the FOMC

at its October meeting would have to be quickly reversed. The Chairman,

therefore, recommended--and a majority of the members concurred--that the

Desk continue aiming for a Federal funds rate at about the prevailing level

of 5 per cent. In the following week, with additional data suggesting

continued strength in the aggregates, the Chairman advised the Desk that

an increase in the funds rate would be inconsistent with the Committee's

intentions.

(3) Interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range since

the October Committee meeting. Most market rates edged upwards, as

market expectations of an immediate further decline in the Federal funds

rate were apparently disspelled early in the intermeeting period by

published weekly data suggesting that the monetary aggregates would grow

substantially in October. In lagged response to earlier declines in market



yields, however, the bank prime rate was reduced ¼ of a point to 6½ per

cent. In the mortgage market, the FNMA auction yield and interest rates

on conventional home mortgages reported by savings and loan associations

have declined somewhat in recent weeks. Stock prices have fallen

significantly further since the October FOMC meeting.

(4) Corporate demands for long term credit, after being very

strong through much of October, have been moderating recently, but the

volume of new tax exempt bond offerings has remained quite high. The

Treasury has also been an active borrower over the period since the

October FOMC meeting, raising $1.3 billion of new money through the sale

of 2-year notes in late October and $2.5 billion in connection with its

mid-November refunding. In the refunding, the Treasury auctioned $3.3

billion of 3-year notes at an average rate of 6.36 per cent, $2.2 billion

of 7-year notes at an average rate of 7.02 per cent and $1.0 billion of a

reopened 23¼ year bond at an average rate of 7.79 per cent. These issues

have most recently been trading around their auction averages. Dealers

have made fairly good progress in distributing the large awards they

received in the auctions.

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below are three alternative sets of short-run

specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate.

More detailed data, including longer-run growth rates, are shown in the

tables on pp. 5a and 5b.

(7) Each of the alternatives presented is believed to be generally

consistent with the longer-run ranges for the aggregates covering the

QIII '76-QIII '77 period adopted by the Committee at the November 8

telephone meeting. But each of the shorter-run alternatives implies a

different pattern of interest rates and of money growth rates within the

(8) Alternative A involves an easing in money market conditions

over the next few weeks--with the funds rate moving down to the mid-point

of a 4-5 per cent range. However, assuming the staff's projection of the

rate of expansion in nominal GNP over the next year is correct, interest rates

would not be expected to decline for long and would probably soon have to

begin rising if M1 growth over the QIII '76-QIII '77 period were to be kept

to around 5½ per cent (the mid-point of the Committee's longer-run range of

4½-6½ per cent). On balance, money market conditions would be somewhat

easier and monetary growth rates somewhat more rapid over the next six

months under alternative A than under alternatives B or C. On the other

hand, alternative A would involve greater monetary restraint in the second

six months of the QIII '76-QIII '77 period.

(9) Alternative B involves maintenance of the Federal funds

rate at around 5 per cent over the next few weeks. We have also assumed

that credit and money demands would not begin to exert significant

upward pressures on the rate until around the middle of the first quarter

of 1977. Moreover, because alternative B--in contrast to alternative A--

does not involve any additional stimulation over the near term, not as

much monetary restraint would be required in the spring and summer of

next year to attain a one-year growth rate of 5½ per cent in M1. As a

result, the funds rate would rise less than under alternative A.

(10) Alternative C involves a tightening in the money market

over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to around 5½ per cent

by the time of the next Committee meeting. With such an early effort to



restrain growth in the aggregates, we would expect that little, if any,

further tightening would be required later.

(11) In general, under all three alternatives, the staff fore-

sees less upward pressure on interest rates than it had earlier. Transactions

needs for money are expected to be lower than thought earlier because the

staff's projection of nominal GNP over the next year has been further reduced.

Also, of course, financial innovations of the past year or two are expected

to continue to reduce the demand for M1 over the coming year.

(12) If our assessment of the interest rate outlook is correct,

it appears likely that growth in M2 and M3 over the QIII '76-QIII '77

period under any of the three alternatives may be at, or a shade above, the

upper ends of the 7½-10 and 9-11½ per cent ranges adopted for them by the

Committee. In making these estimates, we have assumed no substantial

near-term efforts by banks and thrift institutions to discourage recent

large inflows of time and savings deposits (other than large CD's) by

lowering offering rates on time certificates or by other means. If such

efforts develop, or if upward market interest rate pressures turn out to

be stronger than expected, growth in M2 and M3 would be more likely to fall

within the Committee's ranges.

(13) Under any of the alternatives presented, we expect M1

growth over the November-December period to be modest. Assuming unchanged

money market conditions over the next few weeks, as under alternative B,

M1 may expand in a 2½-6½ per cent annual rate range during the 2-month

period. Incoming data for early November suggest a sharp deceleration

in growth during the current month from the unusually high October rate



Moreover, growth is unlikely to strengthen in December, given the sluggish

expansion in economic activity now expected in the fourth quarter. If the

mid-point of the 2½-6½ per cent November-December range is realized, growth

in M1 from the third to the fourth quarter would be at almost a 7 per cent

annual rate.

(14) Expansion in M2 is expected to be quite sizable in November

and December. Recent data suggest that net inflows of time and savings

deposits (other than large CD's) at banks are continuing at around the

rapid September-October pace. Interest rates on such deposits are expected

to remain attractive over the weeks ahead as competing market interest

rates remain relatively low, especially under alternatives A and B. With

the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, growth for M2

during November-December may be in a 9½-13½ per cent annual rate range--

the mid-point of which is above the upper limit of the Committee's longer-

run range. (The mid-point of the 2-month M1 growth band, on the other hand,

is at the lower limit of its longer-run range). The tightening of money

market conditions contemplated under alternative C may reduce the 2-month

M2 growth rate to an 8½-12½ per cent range.

(15) Credit demands are not expected to be particularly strong

between now and year-end. Neither information from the banking community

nor underlying economic forces suggest that business loan growth at banks

will be as large in the weeks ahead as it was in October, when there was

a surge in loan growth. Corporate demands on capital markets--particularly

the public bond market--seem to be in process of moderating, but a large

volume of foreign bond offerings is scheduled over the next few weeks.



The Treasury will probably raise $5 to $7 billion of new cash in the market

between now and year-end, but borrowing of this size has probably already

been discounted in the market.

(16) Thus, if the funds rate over the next few weeks stays around

its currently prevailing level of 5 per cent, market interest rates

generally are not likely to be under any upward pressure from the demand

side. If incoming economic data remain weak and expectations of a further

easing in monetary policy once again develop, interest rates might edge

down. And if the Federal funds rate should decline over the next few

weeks by about ½ percentage point, short-term rates may well drop sub-

stantially, with the 3-month bill rate perhaps falling to around 4 per

cent. Expectations of a discount rate decline would become more wide-

spread. Downward pressures on institutional rates--such as the prime loan

rate and primary mortgage market rates--would intensify. On the other

hand, if the Federal funds rate were to rise by about ½ percentage point,

there might be very considerable upward market rate adjustments in the short

run--particularly in the U.S. Government securities market, where dealer

positions are currently very large.



-10-

Proposed directive

(17) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the

directive if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions

in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectation that

the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term

targets and that at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those

targets.

"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

(18) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank

reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on

the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-

tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

are given below.

Alternative "Money Market" Proposals

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market conditions

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market condi-

tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over

the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES

APPENDIX A

Comparison of Actual and Targeted Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the four-week period ending November 17 with the "targeted" level

that had been thought consistent with the mid-points of the short-run

ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

Actual /  Targeted Differences

1. (2+3) Nonborrowed reserves 34,601 34,362 239

2. Required reserves 34,462 34,134 328

3. (4-5) Free reserves 139 228 -89

4. Excess reserves 241 263 -22

5. Member bank borrowing 102 35 67

6. (1+5) Total reserves 34,703 34,397 306

7. Currency 82,660 83,023 -363

8. (6+7) Monetary base 117,363 117,420 57

As can be seen from the table, actual nonborrowed reserves were

$240 million higher than the "targeted" level. Required reserves were

about $330 million above expectations as deposits subject to reserves

turned out to be significantly higher than expected. The Desk did not

have to increase nonborrowed reserves by quite that amount to keep the

funds rate unchanged because banks' demand for free reserves was lower

than expected.

Total reserves were also higher than expected. But the monetary

base was near the targeted level, as currency expanded less than expected.

1/ Includes week of November 17, which is partly estimated.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 and 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 8 and 9 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 11 gives FNMA auction
data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 12 is a 1-day quote for the Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average
net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages
carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FRA/VA ceiling.
