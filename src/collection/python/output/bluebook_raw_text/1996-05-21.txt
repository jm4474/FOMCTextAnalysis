The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Class I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the March 26 FOMC meeting, federal funds generally

have traded close to their intended level of 5-1/4 percent. Although

banks have continued to implement retail sweep programs, seasonal

strength in transaction deposits and required reserve balances and a

modest expansion of required clearing balances have kept total

required balances from eroding further over the intermeeting period.

Desk operations were complicated by unexpectedly strong flows of

individual nonwithheld tax payments, which resulted in persistent

overshoots relative to projections in the Treasury's balance at

Federal Reserve Banks in late April.

(2) The Committee's decision at the March meeting to leave

its intended level for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent was

anticipated by market participants and had little effect on other

interest rates. Nonetheless, market rates subsequently climbed sub-

stantially over the intermeeting period, except at the shortest

maturities (chart). Intermediate- and long-term Treasuries rose 25

to 40 basis points, on balance. As over the previous intermeeting

period, the increases were especially sharp on several days when

economic releases pointed to brisk growth in output and employment.

A considerable portion of the rise probably represents an increase in

real interest rates, apparently reflecting market views that monetary

policy will need to be tighter than previously thought in order to

keep the economy on a path of sustainable growth. Changed expecta-

tions about policy are reflected in quotes on federal funds futures

contracts, which have risen appreciably and now suggest that partici-

pants see some possibility of tightening by the end of the year.

Surveymeasures of inflation expectations have ticked up, suggesting

that the backup in nominal yields also owed in part to market concerns

about price increases. The climb in grain and energy prices and

stronger economic growth in the context of aggregate output around the

economy's capacity seemed to heighten inflation fears, but more

recently relatively low readings on core inflation and the retreat of

oil prices appear to have damped those concerns. The rise in yields

on coupon securities steepened the Treasury yield curve, but has not

left it unusually steep by historic standards, reinforcing the impres-

sion that market participants anticipate that economic developments

will dictate only minor interest rate adjustments. Most stock price

indexes rose over the intermeeting period, as generally favorable

first-quarter earnings reports and the stronger economic outlook

evidently outweighed the effects of the backup in interest rates.

(3) The rise in U.S. interest rates contributed to an in-

crease in the dollar's exchange value of 1-3/4 percent on a weighted-

average basis since the March Committee meeting. The dollar was espe-

cially strong against the mark, and to a lesser extent against other

European currencies, reflecting indications of continued weak economic

activity in Europe. Three-month interest rates edged lower in Germany

on expectations of further monetary easing; the Bundesbank cut its

discount and Lombard rates by 1/2 percentage point on April 18, but

has not yet lowered its repo rates. German long-term bond yields were

unchanged, on balance. The dollar rose by a lesser amount against the

yen. Signs of continuing Japanese economic recovery heightened expec-

tations of a move by the Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy,

though these concerns were largely allayed by statements from the Bank



of Japan in mid-May. On balance, short- and long-term rates in Japan

showed little net change over the period.

The Desk did not intervene.

(4) The growth of overall debt has remained moderate on aver-

age in recent months, with the total debt of domestic nonfinancial

sectors staying near the middle of its 3 to 7 percent annual range.

Net federal borrowing was light in April, held down in part by strong

tax receipts. Nonfederal credit flows appear to have maintained the

slower growth pace of around 5 percent that was established around the

middle of 1995. Household and business borrowing seems to have moder-

ated a little, while the runoff of state and local debt has turned to

a modest expansion owing to a slowdown in redemptions. In the busi-

ness sector, a slowing in equity retirements has reduced credit needs.

Bond issuance has been damped by the increase in long-term rates, with

some borrowers shifting financing into the commercial paper market.

In contrast, business loans at banks expanded sluggishly, on balance,

over March and April. In the household sector, consumer credit de-

celerated sharply in March, and bank figures for April suggest that

borrowing remained on a slower track. The number of mortgage refi-

nancing applications has fallen off appreciably, but--while few data

are yet available--net mortgage borrowing appears to have been re-

strained only slightly to date by the backup in longer-term interest

rates. According to the May senior loan officers survey, banks con-

tinued to ease terms for C&I loans over the previous three months but

tightened standards for consumer credit-card loans.



(5) The broad monetary aggregates slowed in April to annual

growth rates of about 2 percent--a sharper deceleration than projected

at the time of the March FOMC meeting--and both aggregates drew closer

to the upper ends of their ranges on a monthly average basis.1

Data for the first half of May suggest continued weakness in broad

money growth. Last month's fall-off owed partly to a contraction in

demand deposits following surprisingly rapid growth in the first quar-

ter. A failure of currency demand to pick up after the introduction

of the new $100 bill accounted for some of the shortfall of the

aggregates as well. Movements in the opportunity costs of holding

money also have contributed to the slowing of broad money growth, as

the stimulative effects of previous decreases in market interest rates

wore off and the impact of the more recent rise in intermediate- and

long-term rates began to be felt.2 The consequences for money

growth of the unexpected strength in individual nonwithheld tax pay-

ments around April 15 are difficult to sort out: Much of the weakness

in money occurred late in the month when payments to the Treasury

cleared, but in the past large tax payments have been associated with

strength in the aggregates in April owing to the buildup of balances

early in the month. The sluggishness in M2 showed through to M3,

despite a rebound in bank credit.

1. M1 contracted at a 3 percent annual rate in April but expanded
at a 4-3/4 percent rate after adjusting for the estimated effects of
new retail sweep accounts. The monetary base contracted at a 3/4
percent rate but rose at a 1-1/2 percent rate after adjustment for
sweep accounts.

2. Flows into stock and bond mutual funds have remained brisk. At
a 4-1/4 percent annual rate, M2+ is estimated to have expanded more
quickly than M2 in April.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Incoming data suggest both stronger demand and slightly

higher resource utilization rates than were anticipated by the staff

at the time of the March FOMC meeting. In the Greenbook forecast, the

recent rise in interest and exchange rates, which are expected to hold

near current levels with an unchanged federal funds rate, exert some

restraint on economic growth going forward, but the economy still

produces around or a little beyond its potential. The high level of

resource utilization, combined with the effects of rising food and

energy prices, imparts a small upward tilt to inflation, with both

core and total CPI projected to increase 3-1/4 percent in 1997. For

1996, the staff forecasts for total CPI inflation and real GDP growth

are above the upper ends of the central tendencies of the projections

of Board members and Presidents last February.

(7) In addition to the rise in food and energy prices,

another potential supply shock is an increase in the minimum wage,

which is discussed in a special section of the Greenbook but not in-

corporated in the basic forecast. These sorts of shocks in principle

could show up as effects on the level of prices, and not on the

ongoing rate of inflation. However, supply shocks could get built

into inflation through attempts by businesses and workers to maintain

real earnings--in the case of businesses by passing through higher

costs into prices and for workers by linking wage demands to past

inflation. In addition, observed price increases could lead to infla-

tion by being extrapolated into the future and incorporated into

inflation expectations. Both mechanisms produce a similar result,

requiring a monetary policy response to avoid a ratcheting up of the

inflation rate. Paragraph 8, describing the policy response, treats



the process as working through expectations, but its analysis would

hold for the "catch-up" mechanism as well.

(8) Under circumstances in which price shocks were tending to

boost expected inflation, policy would have to offset effects working

through two channels. First, with unchanged nominal short-term inter-

est rates, a rise in expected inflation over the near-term would lower

real short-term rates, thereby tending to raise spending and economic

activity relative to the economy's potential. Such an effect on re-

source use would begin to induce more rapid wage and price increases.

Second, expected inflation is thought to have a direct, independent

influence on wage and price setting. Thus, any rise in expected

inflation could further add to the rate of inflation on a lasting

basis. To counter these effects on ongoing inflation, were they to

emerge, the Federal Reserve would need to raise the nominal funds

rate. Such a tightening would have two components. To prevent any

decline in the real funds rate and thereby avoid any additional pres-

sures on resources, the nominal funds rate would have to be raised

relative to the path it otherwise would follow by the same amount as

the induced increase in inflation expectations. This forestalls any

change in the output gap that, for example, would produce increasing

inflation if the shock occurred with the economy already producing at

its potential. Still, even at this higher nominal funds rate, the

initial uptick in inflation expectations and inflation would persist.

To lean additionally against the inflationary impact resulting from

any initial increase in expected inflation itself, the Federal Reserve

would need to raise the real funds rate, implying a further upward



adjustment to the nominal funds rate.3 That is, to bring inflation

back down once higher expectations became embedded, some slack in

resource utilization would need to be created.

(9) If real rates needed to be raised in response to a sig-

nificant supply shock, the timing and magnitude of the policy actions

would depend on the approach followed. Realistically, no monetary

policy is going to be able to avoid at least some near-term uptick in

measured inflation in these circumstances. A gradualist approach to

bringing inflation back down might be favored if a string of small

output gaps were thought to be preferable to a short, but sharp, cor-

rection, even though the total output loss in either case might be

little different. On the other hand, more forceful policy actions, by

clearly demonstrating the central bank's intention to rein in infla-

tion, could have a "credibility" effect holding down price expecta-

tions. If such an effect occurred, it would substitute for some of

the need to sacrifice output to bring inflation back to the desired

path.

(10) Despite these potential problems on the inflation front,

the minimum wage has not yet been raised, measures of industrial

prices and of strains on production capacity remain quiescent, and

recent information on core PPI/CPI inflation provides little evidence

of an incipient acceleration. Moreover, the rise in intermediate- and

long-term rates this year may have left these measures not far from

levels consistent with the economy producing at its potential. In

these circumstances, the Committee may prefer to adopt alternative B,

3. Some supply shocks could also raise the NAIRU and reduce poten-
tial output by more than they would damp aggregate demand, increasing
the equilibrium real interest rate. While a minimum wage hike prob-
ably falls into this category, an increase of the magnitude currently
being debated would not have much impact on the equilibrium real rate.



awaiting more concrete evidence that inflationary pressures are emerg-

ing before adopting a tightening action. Financial market partici-

pants are anticipating that the FOMC will leave its policy stance

unchanged at this meeting, implying that selection of alternative B

would have little market impact. Although the Greenbook is forecast-

ing a strong second quarter, many market economists have a similar

view, and hence release of economic data in conformity with the Green-

book forecast should not elicit much response in security prices or

dollar exchange rates.

(11) The case for a policy tightening at this FOMC meeting

presumably would rest on the view that the risks of higher inflation

had become substantial. Even without an assumed minimum wage in-

crease, the Committee may see the gradual upcreep in core CPI infla-

tion projected by the staff as a likely and undesirable outcome. If

the higher rate of overall inflation so far this year were feeding

through in some part to inflation expectations, a rise in the nominal

funds rate would be needed at some point to forestall an effective

easing of the policy stance. Alternative C embodies a 50 basis point

increase in the federal funds rate to 5-3/4 percent in order to

counter the incipient increase in price pressures. The Federal

Reserve is not expected by market participants to tighten for several

months, and hence, investors would be caught off guard by the FOMC's

choice of alternative C at this meeting. Short-term interest rates

would rise by 1/2 percentage point. A sense that the FOMC would be

assuming a more aggressive anti-inflationary posture than previously

anticipated, at least over the near term, might limit increases in

nominal intermediate- and long-term rates, but would lead to an

appreciable increase in real interest rates on instruments of these



-10-

maturities. The value of the dollar would probably ratchet higher on

exchange markets.

(12) The interest rates of alternative B and associated

staff forecast for the economy are thought to be consistent with a

slight moderation in the growth of money and credit over coming months

relative to their pace of expansion so far in 1996. (Projected growth

for April to September and from the fourth quarter to September are

shown in the table below.) The staff anticipates that the terms and

conditions of bank lending will remain on the accommodative side,

though perhaps continuing to firm a little for consumer credit. Only

partly as a consequence, growth of consumer credit is projected to

continue its downtrend, accompanied by sustained moderate expansion of

home mortgage debt. Business borrowing may edge off as the recent

rise in long-term yields continues to restrain bond issuance, while

subdued inventory investment keeps the lid on bank loans and commer-

cial paper. Near-term borrowing by the federal government is now

shaping up as rather weak in light of the build-up in the Treasury's

cash balance stemming from outsized individual tax payments in April.

As a result of the downward-revised forecast for federal debt growth,

the expansion of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt from April to

September is now projected at only a 4-1/2 percent pace, leaving its

level in September somewhat below the 5 percent midpoint of its annual

growth rate range.

(13) The weakish cast of the incoming monetary data, together

with the recent further increases in the returns on intermediate- and

long-term instruments that compete with monetary assets, has led to a

downward revision in the staff's projections of growth in the monetary

aggregates as well. Expansion of M2 and M3 from April to September

has been scaled back to only 3-3/4 and 4 percent, respectively, which

implies that the growth of the broad aggregates will be slower than

that of nominal GDP in both the second and third quarters. Even so,

both aggregates in September are not far below the upper bounds of

their annual ranges of 5 and 6 percent, respectively. The volume of

new sweep programs coming on line over the next few months is expected

to remain substantial. M1 is projected to fall at a rate of 3 percent

from April to September; adjusted for sweeps, M1 is projected to grow

at a rate of 4-3/4 percent.

the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY)/maintain/

INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run

objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth,

and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and

monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve

restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in the intermeeting

period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.
