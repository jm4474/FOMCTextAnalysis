through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) M1 declined at a 1.2 per cent annual rate in June. Although

growth is expected to resume in July, expansion over the June-July period

is now projected at only a 2½ per cent annual rate, below the 3½ per cent

lower bound of the Committee's operating range. Growth in M2 slowed to a

5¼ per cent annual rate in June, mainly because of the weakness in M1. How-

ever, expansion in the time and savings deposit component of M2 also slowed

somewhat; passbook savings declined and growth in small-denomination time

deposits slackened, but there was a partially offsetting increase in large

non-negotiable CD's. These shifts apparently were prompted by the higher

interest rates generally available on market instruments and on bank CD's

following the increases of May. However, growth in bank time and savings

deposits (other than CD's) strengthened considerably in early July, and for

the June-July period, M2 is now projected to expand at a 7¾ per cent rate,

close to the mid-point of the Committee's range. Deposit growth slowed

in June at thrift institutions also.

(2) In the week following the June 22 Committee meeting, incoming

data suggested that over the June-July period M1 and M2 would expand at

rates not far from--although slightly below--the mid-points of their respec-

tive ranges. Accordingly, the Desk aimed at reserve availability consistent

with maintaining the then-prevailing Federal funds rate of 5-1/2 per cent.

The projected growth rates in the aggregates were lowered in the two sub-

sequent weeks, however, and the Desk became more accommodative in its reserve

provision, seeking to move the Federal funds rate toward 5-3/8 per cent in

the July 7 statement week and toward 5-1/4 per cent in the July 14 week.

Data becoming available in the current statement week have tended to support

the expectation of a low M1 growth rate, but the projection for M2 has been

raised somewhat. Under the circumstances, the Desk is continuing to aim for

an average funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent.

(3) Nonborrowed reserves appear to be increasing in the June-

July period at about a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate, less than the rate the

staff had thought would be consistent with the mid-points of the short-run

ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted by the FOMC at its last meeting.1/

This shortfall is due entirely to the slower-than-expected growth in demand

deposits, and therefore, in required reserves. The shortfall would have been

even greater had not the average level of excess reserves in the period

been raised substantially above projections by an unusually large buildup

of excess reserves during the July 7 statement week.

1/ Appendix A contains a discussion of the actual behavior of nonborrowed
reserves in the weeks between the June and July meetings relative to the
behavior that was expected to be consistent with the Committee's short-run
ranges for monetary growth. (As indicated, the comments in the text above
apply to the 2-month June-July period.)



(4) Short-term interest rates have fallen 20 to 40 basis points

since the June Committee meeting. Following a period of stability in late

June, most rates began to move down near the end of the month, and they

declined further in early July as market participants responded to the

decline in the Federal funds rate. Business short-term credit demands

expanded somewhat in June for the second successive month, but the rise was

confined to the commercial paper market; businesses resumed their paydown

of bank debt. The Treasury continued to run off bills in its weekly auctions

in June and early July. However, with borrowing needs substantially greater

in the third quarter than in the second quarter, the Treasury has gradually

reduced the volume of bills redeemed weekly and it has announced that it will

roll over all maturing issues in next Monday's bill auction.

(5) The declines in short-term rates in early June were accom-

panied by reductions in bond yields of about 5 to 15 basis points. Bond

markets also were favorably influenced by the data that became available

during the period on prices and economic activity and by the prospect of

a greatly reduced calendar of new corporate and municipal bond issues in

July and August. For home mortgages, interest rates in the primary market

continued to edge higher until early July.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in terms of percentage

annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are three

alternative sets of longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates,

together with the current ranges for the QI '76 to QI '77 period adopted

by the Committee in April. The alternatives pertain to the one-year period

from QII '76 to QII '77. More detailed figures, including quarterly average

levels and growth rates based on mid-point paths, are shown in the tables

on pages 5a and 5b. Projected patterns for the Federal funds rate are

shown for the three alternatives in Appendix table II.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current

M1 5½ to 8 4½ to 7 3½ to 6 4½ to 7

M2  9 to 11½ 7½ to 10 6½ to 9 7½ to 10

M3  9½ to 12½ 8 to 11 7 to 10 9 to 12

Credit Proxy 5½ to 8½ 5 to 8 4½ to 7½ 6 to 9

(8) Of the three alternatives, B encompasses the current range

for M1, which is centered on a 5¾ per cent growth rate. The current 7

to 10 per cent range for M2 appears to be generally consistent with that

M1 range. However, on the basis of recent experience, it appears that the

pattern of gradually rising short-term interest rates anticipated under

B would lead to a slowing of inflows to thrift institutions more consistent

with an 8 to 11 per cent range for M3. In connection with the M3 range,

it might be noted that the Committee did not reduce the upper bound at its

April meeting when it lowered the upper limits for M1 and M2.

(9) Alternatives A and C call for longer-run M1 ranges one

percentage point higher and lower, respectively, than that shown under

alternative B. Alternative C would compensate for the second-quarter

overshoot in M 1 , in that M1 would be expected to reach roughly the same

level in the first quarter of 1977 as that implied by a 5¾ per cent growth

rate measured from the first quarter of 1976. To reach this level, M1

would have to expand at about a 4¾ per cent annual rate over the three

quarters ending with the first quarter of 1977.

(10) Short-run operating ranges corresponding generally to the

longer-run alternatives are summarized below.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

1/
Ranges for July-August

M1  5 to 9 4½ to 8½ 4 to 8

M2  9 to 13 8 to 12 7½ to 11½

Federal funds rate 4¼ to 5¼ 4¾ to 5¾ 5¼ to 6¼
(intermeeting period)

(11) Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range over the

next four weeks centered on 5¼ per cent, the Desk's most recent objective;

alternatives A and C assume some easing and some tightening, respectively.

Under all three alternatives, growth in M1 is expected to pick up

appreciably in the July-August period, on the assumption that various

factors which appear to have depressed M1 balances in June--despite rising

nominal GNP--will no longer be operating. These factors include the lagged

1/ Reserve aggregates thought to be consistent with these ranges are
shown in Appendix table I.



-7-

adjustment of money balances to desired levels following the April surge,

the unusually heavy use by corporations of demand deposit balances to make

tax payments in June, and an unexpected and probably temporary slowing

in currency growth. Also, a draw-down in the first half of July of the

Treasury's unusually high end-of-June cash balance may add, at least

temporarily, to private demand balances.

(12) Under alternative B, the annual rate of growth of M1 in the

July-August period is expected to be in a 4½ to 8½ range. (On average from

the second to the third quarter, M 1 is expected to grow at only a 4¾ per

cent annual rate for arithmetic reasons--specifically, because the second

quarter average is high relative to the June level.) Given the projection

for nominal GNP, if growth in M1 over the QII '76-QII '77 period is to be

constrained to 5¾ per cent--the mid-point of the alternative B longer-run

growth range--it is likely that short-term interest rates would have to

begin moving up later in the summer. Under this alternative, the funds rate

is expected to reach 7 per cent in early 1977 and to rise marginally further

in the spring.

(13) If the funds rate remains around 5¼ per cent over the next

four weeks, short-term interest rates are unlikely to change significantly.

Inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's at banks

can be expected to be higher than in June as a result of the declines in

interest rates since mid-year. Over the July-August period, M2 might

expand at an annual rate in an 8 to 12 per cent range. As the year pro-

gresses, however, rising market rates would probably slow net inflows of



-8-

time and savings deposits somewhat. The alternative B projection assumes

an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings in early 1977.

(14) Alternative C contemplates a modest tightening of the money

market over the next few weeks, with the Federal funds rate moving to the

5-3/4 per cent mid-point of the funds rate range. Subsequently, interest

rates undoubtedly would have to rise appreciably further if M1 growth over

the QII '76 to QII '77 period is to be constrained to the 4-3/4 per cent

mid-point of the longer-run range. By the spring of 1977, the funds rate

might be around 8-1/4 per cent. Under these circumstances, inflows of

funds into small-denomination deposits at banks and thrift institutions in

the first half of 1977 would be depressed by the greater relative attrac-

tiveness of rates on market instruments, even though under this alternative

Regulation Q ceilings are assumed to be relaxed in the fourth quarter of 1976.

(15) Alternative A contemplates more rapid growth in the monetary

aggregates over QII '76-QII '77--including a 6-3/4 per cent growth rate for

M1 --and some near-term easing of money market conditions, with the funds

rate range centering on 4-3/4 per cent. With economic expansion continu-

ing, however, it would be expected that interest rates would have to begin

rising in early fall, with the funds rate reaching 5-3/4 per cent by early

1977 and 6-1/2 per cent in the spring. Under these conditions, inflows of

interest-bearing deposits would probably accelerate for a time and M2 and

M3 would remain quite strong into early winter--before slowing as rates on

market securities become more attractive.



(16) Over the July-August period, corporate and municipal bond

offerings are expected to recede more than seasonally from their recent

high levels. The Treasury is expected to take advantage of this reduced

forward calendar to continue its debt-lengthening operations. During the

third quarter the Treasury is expected to raise in the neighborhood of

$14 billion of new money, and it appears that about one-half of this amount

will be raised in the forthcoming intermeeting period. In addition, the

Treasury will also have to refund $4.6 billion of publicly held debt matur-

ing on August 15.

(17) Increases in bond yields over the balance of the year are

expected to be relatively small. Business and other credit demands on

banks can be expected to strengthen somewhat over the second half as inven-

tory and fixed capital expenditures increase and long-term borrowing slows.

Under alternative B, and especially under C, banks would be likely to reduce

their acquisitions of Treasury securities and to borrow in CD and Eurodollar

markets. Under alternative A, inflows of other deposits should reduce the

need for banks to rely on such sources of funds over the balance of the

year.

Proposed directive

(18) Presented below are four alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched

in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

and are intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

discussed in the preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed

in the event that the Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in

terms of money market conditions and to maintain the conditions now

prevailing.

Alternative "Monetary Aggregates" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with [DEL: moderate] SUBSTANTIAL growth in monetary aggregates

over the period ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the

period ahead.



-11-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with [DEL: moderate] MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over

the period ahead.

"Money Market" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money

market conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary

aggregates] over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT

MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES

CURRENTLY EXPECTED.



Appendix A

Comparison of Actual and Targeted Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the four-week period ending July 21 with the "targeted" level that

had been thought consistent with the mid-points of the short-run ranges

for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

Actual 1/  Targeted Differences

1. (2+3) Nonborrowed reserves 34,428 34,339 89

2. Required reserves 34,208 34,268 -60

3. (4-5) Free reserves 220 71 149

4. Excess reserves 356 239 117

5. Member bank borrowing 136 168 -32

6. (1+5) Total Reserves 34,564 34,506 58

7. Currency 80,505 80,759 -254

8. (6+7) Monetary base 115,069 115,265 -196

As can be seen from the table, even though required reserves were

$60 million lower than anticipated during the intermeeting period, non-

borrowed reserves were about $90 million higher than "targeted." Banks

held more excess reserves and borrowed less than had been thought con-

sistent with the ranges specified for the monetary aggregates. Required

reserves were below expectations because of weakness in deposits subject

to reserves, which was only partly offset by a slightly lower multiplier

between lagged deposits and current required reserves.

1/ Includes week of July 21, which is partly estimated.



A - 2

Despite the strength in ndnborrowed reserves, total reserves

were only slightly larger than anticipated because of the shortfall in

member bank borrowings. The monetary base, however, was well below

"target" because the growth in currency in circulation was much smaller

than expected.

Achievement of the nonborrowed reserve "target" during the

period would have resulted in a higher Federal funds rate, possibly near

the upper end of the 5¾ to 5¾ per cent range adopted by the FOMC. On

the other hand, if the Desk had attempted to achieve the "targeted" monetary

base, the Federal funds rate would have been much lower than actually

prevailed.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Feder
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

**Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.*STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

VKOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 and 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 8 and 9 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 11 gives FNMA auction
data for the Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 12 is a 1-day quote for the Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FHMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average
net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FRA/VA mortgages carrying
the coupon rate 50 baris points below the current WFA/VA ceiling.
