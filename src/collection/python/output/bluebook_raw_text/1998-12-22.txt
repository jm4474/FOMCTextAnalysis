Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Although financial markets had not fully anticipated the Committee's quarter-

point easing of the intended federal funds rate at its November meeting, the accompanying

statement was interpreted by the market as suggesting that no additional action was likely at the

December meeting, so that market interest rates showed small, mixed changes. However, most

interest rates declined, on balance, over the intermeeting period as a whole (chart 1).1 The largest

decreases in Treasury rates--amounting to 27 basis points-came at longer maturities, in response

to a weaker outlook for foreign activity and to the effect of lower oil and other commodity prices

on the prospects for inflation. Real interest rates, as measured by yields on indexed securities,

were about flat over the period. On net, major equity indexes posted changes ranging from about

1 percent lower to 12 percent higher. Investors see little chance of a policy move at the

December meeting, although, judging by federal funds futures rates, market participants appear

to have built in about even odds of an easing at the February meeting and a very high probability

of action by mid-year.

(2) The November policy move seemed to encourage further unwinding of strains in

financial markets over the next week or two. Equity markets extended their rally, and quality

spreads and the implied volatility of bond and stock prices fell somewhat further from their

October highs (chart 2); issuance in the corporate bond market, which had picked up before the

1. Some money-market rates increased over the period, however, because their terms crossed
year-end, and so they began to include the effects of anticipated year-end pressures.

meeting, remained heavy. Although markets have continued to be receptive to corporate debt

offerings, in recent weeks indicators of market stress have reversed a portion--and in some cases

more than all--of their improvement after the last meeting. In part, the recent deterioration in

market conditions reflects widespread warnings of lower corporate profits, heightened policy

uncertainties in Brazil, and a weaker outlook for Europe. The reduced willingness of market

participants to take positions-especially before year-end-appears to have decreased liquidity,

tending to exaggerate price movements.2

(3) The effective federal funds rate averaged very close to the intended level over the

intermeeting period, and variation around the intended rate declined somewhat from the elevated

levels of the preceding interval.3 Nonetheless, variability remained on the high side.

Intertemporal arbitrage of the federal funds rate has been impaired by continuing caution in

reserve management and perhaps also by the further erosion of required operating balances,

which flirted with record lows over the intermeeting period, as the introduction of new sweep

programs continued to trim transactions deposits.

2. Recently, premiums for lower-tier commercial paper over the extended New Year's
weekend have been on the order of 400 basis points at an annual rate, considerably more than a
year ago. By contrast, year-end effects have been relatively modest by the standards of recent
years in the federal funds market, where the premium is currently about 100 to 150 basis points,
although some foreign institutions about which there are credit concerns are paying considerably
more.

3. At its November meeting, the Committee amended the Authorization for Domestic Open
Market Operations to extend the permitted maturity of System repurchase agreements (RPs) from
fifteen to sixty days. Over the intermeeting period, the Desk availed itself of this new authority
on three occasions, arranging System RPs with maturities between thirty and forty-five days to
meet anticipated seasonal demands over year-end. In addition, the Desk undertook its first
coupon pass of inflation-indexed Treasury securities, buying $437 million of such securities for
the System account on November 23.



-3-

(4) The weighted average value of the dollar against major currencies declined about

1 percent over the intermeeting period. Concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. markets to

financial difficulties in Brazil and uncertainty generated by the impeachment proceedings

weighed on the dollar at times. Hostilities in Iraq have had a negligible effect on the foreign

exchange value of the dollar. In Europe, a slackening of inflation pressures and signs of slowing

economic growth prompted monetary easing, including a coordinated interest rate reduction by

euro-area central banks on December 3 and a reduction in the official repo rate of the Bank of

England on December 10. On balance, European long-term interest rates fell somewhat more

than those in the United States, but the dollar was about unchanged against the mark and sterling

over the intermeeting period. In Japan, by contrast, the call money target rate has held steady,

and the yield on the bellwether government bond rose about 45 basis points over the period,

boosted by expectations of sizable increases in government bond issuance to finance fiscal

stimulus. With the dollar-yen interest rate differential narrowing, the dollar depreciated 3-1/4

percent against the yen. The Bank of Canada matched the U.S. policy move in November, and

the U.S. dollar eased less than 1 percent against the Canadian dollar. U.S. monetary authorities

did not intervene in foreign exchange markets over the period.

(5) Latin American equity markets, which had moved higher early in the period in

the wake of the announcement of a financial support package for Brazil, displayed renewed

strains following the decision by that country's lower house of congress to reject a key fiscal

reform measure. Subsequent decisions by the legislature to delay consideration of other reforms

reinforced concerns about the policy outlook. Equity prices in Brazil declined 16 percent,

Brazil's Brady bond spread rose 350 basis points, and capital outflows continued. In Mexico,



-4-

equity prices and Brady bond spreads were little changed on balance. Mexican authorities

tightened monetary policy to support the peso, which ended the period up 2 percent against the

dollar. In Asia, some currencies experienced upward pressures against the dollar, resulting in

part from their increased competitiveness vis-a-vis Japan as the yen strengthened against those

currencies, as well as from the declining interest rates in industrial countries. Monetary

authorities in many of these emerging market economies took this opportunity to ease policy.

Equity prices continued to move higher in a number of Asian countries. The rise was particularly

large in Korea, where recent data suggest that the recession has bottomed out, and the Korean

won rose 8-3/4 percent against the dollar. The currencies of other Asian emerging market

economies were mixed, on balance, against the dollar over the period.

(6) The broad monetary aggregates continued to expand robustly in November. M2

advanced at a 10-1/4 percent pace, reflecting, in part, the reduction in its opportunity cost

resulting from monetary policy easings this fall. In addition, heavy mortgage refinancing activity

provided a fillip to liquid deposit growth, while demand for currency, both at home and abroad,

apparently continued to expand briskly. However, growth of M2 last month was a bit below both

the October rate and the projection in the November bluebook. The slight moderation reflected a

sharp slowing in retail money fund growth, possibly reflecting a shift by some investors back into

bond and stock mutual funds in association with the substantial rise in equity prices and the

partial quelling of market turbulence after mid-October. In contrast, M3 accelerated somewhat to

a 14-1/2 percent pace in November, appreciably above the rate projected in the last bluebook.

Much of the rapid increase in the non-M2 portion of M3 was accounted for by continued heavy

flows into institution-only money market funds. M3 was also bolstered by advances in RPs,



-5-

likely reflecting in part the funding of brisk securities acquisitions by banks. Incoming data

indicate some deceleration in both of these aggregates this month.

(7) From the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, M2 grew an

estimated 8-3/4 percent, placing this aggregate well above the upper bound of its 1 to 5 percent

range.4 In part, the robust expansion over the year can be attributed to relatively rapid growth in

nominal income and to the decline in market interest rates in late 1997 and in 1998. These

factors, though, cannot explain all the strength in M2; among the other forces that likely boosted

money growth in 1998 are increased demand for safe and liquid assets as investors responded to

the heightened volatility in financial markets in the second half of the year and households'

ongoing efforts to reverse some of the decline in the share of their portfolios allocated to

monetary assets, following several years of outsized gains in stock market wealth. M3 grew even

faster than M2, posting an estimated 10-3/4 percent rise from the final quarter of 1997 to the final

quarter of 1998, substantially above the upper end of its 2 to 6 percent range. The rapid advance

in M3--the fastest since 1984--importantly reflected the funding of vigorous growth in depository

credit with managed liabilities, many of which are in M3. The strong expansion in depository

credit owed in turn to rapid growth in spending, decisions by banks to lever up their capital by

purchasing substantial volumes of securities, and a shift by some borrowers to bank loans when

financial markets were troubled in the fall. However, M3 growth was boosted to an even greater

4. M1 expanded 1-1/2 percent in 1998 on a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, but it grew
at a 5-3/4 percent rate after adjusting for the initial effects of new retail sweep accounts. Over
this four-quarter period, the initial incremental effects of new retail sweeps in reducing
transaction deposits totaled about $60 billion, bringing the cumulative total since 1994 to over
$300 billion.

extent by flows into institution-only money funds, which are capturing a growing share of the

corporate cash management market and whose relative attractiveness was temporarily enhanced

late in the year by declines in short-term market interest rates.

(8) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt has expanded at a greater than 6 percent annual

rate over the past few months, with robust growth in nonfederal debt more than offsetting

paydowns by the federal government. Demand for credit continued to be buoyed by strong

spending on durable goods, housing, and business investment as well as by merger and

acquisition activity. Disruptions in securities markets since mid-August apparently did not

significantly damp private borrowing, as a well-capitalized banking system was able to

accommodate demand deflected from those markets and federally sponsored agencies continued

their aggressive acquisitions of mortgages. On a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, domestic

nonfinancial debt is projected to increase 6-1/4 percent this year--in the top half of its 3 to 7

percent range, considerably outstripping the growth of nominal income. The relatively strong

growth of debt may reflect the outsized contribution to GDP this year of domestic demand--a

higher proportion of which may be financed with U.S. debt than is likely to be the case for

exports.

Policy Alternatives

(9) In light of the surprising strength in incoming real-side data as well as the

buoyancy of equity markets, the staff has boosted its forecast of GDP growth. Compared with

the projection in the November Greenbook, real GDP is anticipated to grow about 1/2 percentage

point faster in 1999, starting from a level of output in the fourth quarter of this year that is

somewhat higher than anticipated a month ago. The resulting growth of output is still a little

below that of potential in 1999 and again in 2000. Production has been supported in recent years

by sustained large increases in outlays for capital goods, inventories, consumer durables, and

housing. Given the high levels of these stocks relative to output and income, firms and

households should slow the rate of accumulation of these goods--a tendency reinforced in the

outlook by the projected slight weakening in equity prices, which holds down household net

worth and raises the cost of capital to businesses. The outlook for inflation is little changed, as

the impact of tighter labor markets than in the last forecast is nearly offset by the effects of recent

declines in oil and other commodity prices on the prospects for inflation and inflationary

expectations. Overall prices are anticipated to rise considerably faster in 1999 and 2000 than in

1998; the pickup largely reflects the effects of a turnaround in oil prices, with core CPI inflation

over the next two years remaining at about the level of 1998.

(10) If the Committee views the Greenbook forecast as acceptable and the most likely

outcome, it presumably would maintain the intended federal funds rate at 4-3/4 percent, as under

alternative B. The announcement just after the last Committee meeting indicated that the

cumulative easing since September had appropriately positioned policy to promote sustained

growth and low inflation. The incoming data might be read, on balance, as providing no



-9-

compelling reason to change that view. Although measures of activity have been on the strong

side, inflation has remained damped. Slower wage growth, along with declining commodity

prices, suggests that price pressures and inflation expectations should be contained for some

time, even in the face of what appear to be very tight labor markets. Moreover, the points of

vulnerability to the outlook seem about as they were at the time of the last policy ease. Foreign

economies are expected to strengthen on balance next year, but a significantly worse outcome

cannot be ruled out. Strains in U.S. financial markets, for the most part, do not differ materially

from mid-November, with credit spreads remaining elevated and markets still comparatively

unsettled. As a consequence of the mix of incoming information and the wording of the

November announcement, market participants do not expect a policy move in either direction at

this meeting, and, absent an especially compelling case for policy action, the Committee may

wish to avoid surprising them-particularly before year-end when thin markets and a reluctance to

put capital at risk could magnify the effects of any policy action.

(11) Against this backdrop, the choice of alternative B should have little effect on

domestic interest rates or dollar exchange rates. After year-end, when trading volume picks up

and investors again become more willing to put weaker credits on their balance sheets, conditions

in securities markets may well become more liquid, and risk spreads could well narrow. Still,

difficulties in foreign financial markets, domestic market disruptions, high volatility, and unusual

patterns of asset price movements of recent months are likely to leave a lasting imprint on

perceptions of risk, the appetite for it, and the resources dedicated to taking positions in financial

markets. As a consequence, spreads in many markets should remain appreciably above their

levels of last summer and liquidity somewhat reduced.



-10-

(12) The choice of the quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C

would seem to rest on the judgment that the inflation outcome in the staff forecast is

unacceptable or that there are significant risks of a more substantial pickup in inflation. In the

staff forecast, core CPI inflation persists above 2 percent, and many other measures of inflation

notch higher. The Committee may believe that a worse inflationary scenario is plausible because

the economy continues to operate beyond its long-run potential, incoming data show that

aggregate demand has considerable momentum, and financial conditions in general may now be

too accommodative. The resilience of equity prices in the face of continued earnings

disappointments could suggest the possibility that the stock market will remain a positive

influence on demand, in contrast to the drag anticipated in the staff forecast. Although spreads

remain wide in the bond market, the absolute cost of credit, averaging across quality classes, is

little changed from early summer, when the Committee was concerned about inflation pressures.

Moreover, the cost of funds is down substantially for borrowers from banks as well as in the

commercial paper market owing to the monetary policy easings. And after the turn of the year,

markets might become even more attractive to private borrowers. In addition, the foreign

exchange value of the dollar against the major currencies has fallen 6 percent since mid-July.

Finally, the surprise easing of monetary policy in continental Europe may indicate an increased

willingness there to respond to signs of demand weakness, which would facilitate easing in other

countries and reduce the risk of a slackening in global economic activity.

(13) The case for easing further at some point, as in the 1/4 point reduction in the

federal funds rate at this meeting of alternative A, might rest on the view that there are

substantial risks of a shortfall in global demand and of more downward pressure on prices than



-11-

the Committee might find desirable. The prospects for Brazil remain fragile, and the lack of

progress in resolving fiscal imbalances in that country may now suggest even higher odds for

problems there that would spread to other emerging markets, feeding back to the United States.

Furthermore, the continuing steep declines in oil and commodity prices may be signalling that

worldwide demand is weaker than expected. Such price declines could themselves feed through

to further reductions in aggregate price measures and inflation expectations, elevating the real

federal funds rate, should the nominal funds rate remain unchanged, and putting upward pressure

on real long-term rates. Higher long-term rates could come at an inopportune time given a

possibly developing overhang in manufacturing capacity. Preemptive action to head off undue

restraint on spending might be viewed as especially appropriate if inflation already were expected

to be consistent with price stability. Indeed, market participants implicitly appear to be putting

some weight on these demand and price risks in that they continue to factor into market quotes

another policy ease by mid-year.

(14) Market participants would be surprised by either a tightening or an easing at this

meeting. Hence, reactions would be sharp in either direction, with substantial changes in interest

rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Such reactions would be

exacerbated by the current illiquidity of markets and by the attempts of market participants to

divine the rationale for such an action. While the press release could help to shape the

interpretation of the action by market participants, they might suspect other motives or

undisclosed information. Reactions to a tightening would be greater than to an easing, because

the former would reverse recent trends in policy and would be inconsistent with the direction of

policy currently built into the yield curve.



-12-

(15) Under alternative B, conditions in credit markets could well improve after the turn

of the year, but lenders should stay on the cautious side as the growth of economic activity slows

and profits and incomes soften further. This caution is likely to keep the price of credit elevated

for more marginal business borrowers, but other businesses should continue to find credit readily

available. Most households, too, are unlikely to face unusual credit stringency, although lenders

will probably remain selective. As the growth of spending slows, business and household

borrowing should decelerate over coming quarters. Overall nonfinancial debt should slow to a

5-1/4 percent annual rate from November to March, around the center of its 3 to 7 percent

provisional range for 1999.

(16) Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are likely to decelerate substantially. The growth

of M2 in the first quarter will probably continue to exceed that of nominal income, in part

reflecting the lingering effects of the decline in market interest rates in the latter part of 1998. As

a result, velocity will decline, but by only about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate, approximately

one-half of the pace that appears to have occurred in the current quarter. The slowing in the

decline in velocity owes in part to a tapering off of the enhanced demands for liquidity that

accompanied the financial turmoil. M3 is projected to grow faster than M2 as bank credit should

continue to expand rapidly, financed in part with wholesale instruments, and as inflows of

institution-only money funds are expected to stay brisk. Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are

projected to expand over the November-to-March period at annual rates of 7-1/2 and 9 percent,

respectively. Under all of the alternatives, M2 and M3 by March would be well above their

provisional ranges.

Directive Language

(17) Shown below are three options for the operational paragraph: Option 1 is the

traditional wording; option 2 is alternative language shown in the November bluebook; and

option 3 represents revised alternative language incorporating the Committee's comments at the

November meeting. Also, the monetary aggregates sentence in all three options contains

different choices to characterize expected money growth.

Traditional Wording of the Operating Paragraph

(Option 1)

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/INCREASING/ decreasing the

federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ____ [DEL: 4-3/4] percent. In the context of the

Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving

careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a

slightly/SOMEWHAT higher federal funds rate WOULD/MIGHT or a slightly/SOMEWHAT

lower federal funds rate would/MIGHT be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate/some moderation

in/some pickup in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

Alternative Language for the Operating Paragraph

(Option 2)

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds rate at/to an average of



-14-

around percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that

prospective developments are [equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease (NO TILT)];

[more likely to warrant an increase/a decrease than a decrease/an increase (TILT)] in the federal

funds rate in coming months. Any potential changes in the federal funds rate operating objective

during the intermeeting period should be considered in that context. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate/some moderation in/some pickup in the

growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

Revised Alternative Language for the Operating Paragraph

(Option 3)

Topromote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds rate at/to an average of

around ____ percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that

prospective developments are [equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease (NO TILT)];

[more likely to warrant an increase/a decrease than a decrease/an increase (TILT)] in the federal

funds rate operating objective in coming months as well as during the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate/some moderation

in/some pickup in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
