1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1.27 percent over the intermeeting period. 
The Desk expanded the System’s outright holding of securities by $6.5 billion, with
purchases from foreign official customers of $1.2 billion of Treasury bills and purchases
from dealers of $5.3 billion of Treasury coupon securities.  The volume of outstanding long-
term RPs decreased $7 billion to $12 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The decision at the June 30 FOMC meeting to increase the target federal

funds rate by 25 basis points to 1¼ percent was anticipated in financial markets. 

Nonetheless, investors revised down their expectations for the path of policy upon

the release of the accompanying statement.  In particular, investors noted that the

Committee attributed some of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors,

again characterized the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced, and

reiterated its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is

likely to be measured.1  Subsequently, the Chairman’s monetary policy testimony,

which indicated that recent softness in consumer spending should prove short-lived

and emphasized the FOMC’s commitment to price stability, spurred a rise in

expectations for the path of policy.  Over the intermeeting period to date, though,

policy expectations have been revised down on net, as incoming data have pointed to

weaker-than-anticipated spending and more subdued core inflation (Chart 1).  Money

market futures and options prices, as well as the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, 

suggest that market participants are virtually certain of a 25-basis-point increase in the

target federal funds rate at the August meeting.  Nearly all the primary dealers expect

the Committee to retain balanced risk assessments for both growth and price stability,

and many commented that they expect it to repeat the “measured pace” language or

some variant of it.  Looking further out, futures quotes now indicate that investors

expect the funds rate to rise to around 2 percent by the end of this year and

3¼ percent by the end of 2005, down about 25 and 45 basis points, respectively, from

the time of the June meeting.2      

(2) Yields on intermediate- and long-term nominal Treasury securities fell

about 20 to 30 basis points on balance over the intermeeting period, consistent with

the downward revision to policy expectations and perhaps also reflecting heightened

concerns about terrorism.  Standard measures of volatility and liquidity in the Treasury

securities market appear to have held fairly steady at typical levels.  (See the box on

page 3 for a discussion of recent survey evidence on liquidity in funding and

derivatives markets.)  Yields on inflation-indexed issues declined a bit less than those

on nominal Treasuries since the last meeting, leaving inflation compensation measures

narrower and as much as ½ percentage point below their highs of mid-spring.  Survey

measures of inflation expectations also ticked down in July.  The most recent data

suggest that corporate credit quality remains strong, and credit spreads on investment-

and speculative-grade bonds changed little over the intermeeting period (Chart 2).  In

equity markets, most broad indexes fell 5 to 6 percent, but the Nasdaq index dropped

about 10 percent.  Although earnings grew rapidly in the second quarter, equity

investors reacted negatively to the cautious outlook for sales reported by some major

companies, particularly technology firms.  Investor sentiment was also said to be

adversely affected by the sharp increases in spot and futures prices for crude oil over

the intermeeting period (Chart 3). 

(3) In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was about unchanged on balance

against other major currencies since the last FOMC meeting.  The dollar appeared to

be supported by Chairman Greenspan’s monetary policy testimony as well as the

announcement of a narrower U.S. trade deficit for May, but it was weakened by signs

of softer U.S. growth.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar climbed most versus the yen,

rising more than 3 percent over the intermeeting period.  The yen was pressured by

Financial Market Conditions

Financial institutions and markets seemed to have taken the June policy tightening
in stride, with few signs of the volatility and market stress that accompanied the
onset of some past episodes of policy tightening.  A variety of indicators of market
stress—including implied volatilities for equities and long-term bonds, credit
default swap spreads for financial firms, and on-the-run premiums and bid-ask
spreads for Treasury securities—have been fairly steady in recent weeks.  A recent
survey of primary dealers asked the respondents to characterize conditions in long-
and short-term funding markets and interest-rate derivatives markets.  A total of
eighteen dealers responded to the survey.  For both long- and short-term funding
markets, a sizable net percentage of respondents indicated that dealers’ willingness
to act as market makers or underwriters was above normal.  Moreover, about half
of the dealers judged investors’ willingness to bear risk and overall market liquidity
to be normal.  However, several assessed these characteristics as below normal,
hinting at some caution in markets that is not evident in risk and liquidity spreads,
which are relatively narrow.  A few respondents commented that some market
participants were hesitant to take large positions, given expectations for continued
policy tightening.  The net percentage of dealers reporting below-normal liquidity
in interest-rate derivatives markets was somewhat larger than for cash markets,
reportedly reflecting, in part, scaled-back activity of mortgage investors and hedge
funds.

official comments early in the period suggesting that policy tightening was not

imminent in Japan and by disappointing sales and production data.  Higher oil prices

and lower earning expectations at Japanese firms also may have contributed to

theweakness in the yen.  The dollar gained ½ percent against the euro over the

intermeeting period, but lost about 2¼ percent versus the Canadian dollar.  Yields on

long-term government bonds in foreign industrial countries declined by amounts that

either matched or were somewhat smaller than the drop in yields on corresponding

U.S. securities.  Foreign equity prices moved down 2 to 6 percent over the period.3

(4) The dollar was also essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period

against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  In Brazil, signs

of improvement in the domestic economy, as well as continued strong export

performance, boosted stock prices and helped push the real up 2 percent versus the

dollar.  Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed 50 basis points to about 6 percentage points. 

The Mexican peso also gained slightly versus the dollar, as the Banco de Mexico

tightened in late July, citing inflation risks.  China’s slower growth and the somewhat

weaker outlook for some major high-tech firms weighed on share prices in Asian

equity markets, and the Korean won and the Taiwanese dollar both declined

somewhat versus the U.S. dollar.  Russian financial markets were roiled by an ongoing

dispute between the government and the country’s largest oil producer and, for a time,

by runs on several banks.  Russian stock prices fell almost 6 percent, and Russia’s

EMBI+ spread widened somewhat to about 3¼ percentage points.

(5) In U.S. credit markets, growth in overall business debt was subdued in

the second quarter, but it appears to have picked up a little in July as an increase in

short-term borrowing more than offset a net paydown of corporate bonds (Chart 4). 

On a month-average basis, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans rose in both June

and July, the first successive months of growth since 2001.  On net, about a third of

the respondents to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that

demand for C&I loans had increased over the past three months, with firms indicating

that the loan proceeds were used to finance inventories, accounts receivable, plant and

equipment, and mergers and acquisitions.  Supply conditions likely are playing a role

in the recent growth of business loans, as significant net fractions of banks reported

easing business credit standards and terms for the third consecutive survey.  Net

issuance of commercial paper, which had turned positive in the first half of 2004 after

three years of run-offs, jumped in July, likely owing to some of the same demand

factors driving C&I lending.  Household borrowing, while still brisk, appears to have

moderated somewhat in the second quarter, as higher interest rates weighed on

mortgage debt growth and the slower advance in consumption spending limited the

need for consumer credit.  Federal debt continued to grow rapidly in the second

quarter, but state and local government debt issuance dropped, partly as a result of the

improving fiscal conditions of many states.  Total domestic nonfinancial sector debt is

estimated to have advanced at about a 7½ percent annual rate in the second quarter,

more than a percentage point below the first-quarter pace.

(6) Following several months of robust expansion, M2 grew at only a

1½ percent pace in June and appears to have contracted slightly in July.  Some of the

recent weakness can be attributed to the decline in mortgage refinancing activity this

spring and the related runoff of the earlier inflows to liquid deposits.  In addition,

retail money market funds experienced outflows in June and July, as households

apparently found capital market investments more attractive.  Flows into equity

mutual funds, which had lagged in May, picked up in June and July, and bond funds

experienced modest inflows last month following three months of outflows.  In

contrast to other components of M2, currency growth strengthened over the past two

months, partly as a result of strong demand from Iraq and Russia.  The opportunity

cost of holding M2 edged up in the second quarter for the first time in two years as

short-term market interest rates rose in anticipation of the June 30 monetary policy

action.  Nonetheless, M2 expanded briskly on balance in the second quarter, resulting

in a modest decline in velocity.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Weaker-than-expected incoming data on spending have led the staff to

mark down its projection for GDP growth in 2004 to about 4 percent, significantly

below the previous forecast and also below the 4½ to 4¾ percent central tendency of

forecasts made by Committee participants at the June meeting.  As a consequence, the

staff has trimmed its assumed path for monetary policy, with the federal funds rate

now reaching 2¾ percent by the end of next year.  The staff anticipates that yields on

longer-term securities will edge down further over the projection horizon, as the lift

from rising short-term rates is more than offset by a shallower trajectory for the funds

rate than currently incorporated in market prices.  Equity prices are expected to rise

enough from current levels to generate risk-adjusted returns in line with returns on

fixed-income instruments, while the nominal trade-weighted index of the dollar’s

value against major foreign currencies is assumed to fall at an annualized rate of

½ percent.  Oil prices are anticipated to decline to about $38 per barrel by the end of

next year, $4 per barrel higher than in the June forecast.  In 2005, less accommodative

monetary policy and a shift toward fiscal restraint contribute to a moderation in the

advance of GDP to around 3½ percent, still a tad faster than estimated growth in

potential GDP.  As a result, the output gap is projected to contract gradually over the

forecast period and the unemployment rate to edge down to 5¼ percent, a little above

the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU.  The staff continues to forecast core PCE inflation

of about 1¾ percent for 2004, but its forecast for overall PCE inflation has been

boosted to around 2½ percent, reflecting higher energy prices.  Core inflation is

projected to edge down to 1½ percent in 2005, owing to the pass-through of falling

energy and non-oil import prices as well as lingering economic slack, while total PCE

price inflation drops to 1¼ percent.

(8) Table 1 presents three alternatives for near-term policy for the

Committee’s consideration, including draft language for the announcement.  Under

Alternative A, the existing stance of policy would be maintained at this meeting. 

Alternative B would raise the target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to

1½ percent.  Alternative C would boost the funds rate 50 basis points to 1¾ percent.

Assessment 
of 

Risk

5. The Committee perceives the upside
and downside risks to the attainment
of both sustainable growth and price
stability for the next few quarters are
roughly equal.

[Unchanged] [Unchanged]
In current circumstances, the Committee believes
that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if
sustained over the next few quarters, could foster
economic growth that is more likely to be above
than below its long-run sustainable pace.  Similarly,
with respect to the Committee’s goal of price
stability, such an unchanged policy stance implies
greater risks to the upside than the downside.

6. With underlying inflation still
expected to be relatively low, the
Committee believes that policy
accommodation can be removed at a
pace that is likely to be measured. 
Nonetheless, the Committee will
respond to changes in economic
prospects as needed to fulfill its
obligation to maintain price stability.

7

The first two alternatives propose a structure of the announcement fairly close to that

employed at the last meeting.  Alternative C, however, offers a substantial departure

from the form and substance of recent announcements.  It involves an assessment

that the risks to growth and inflation are tilted to the upside—conditioned explicitly

on an unchanged stance of policy following the action—and elimination of the

“measured pace” sentence.  Paragraph 18 discusses a hybrid of Alternatives B and C in

which the funds rate would be increased 25 basis points while some of the language

proposed for Alternative C would be incorporated in the announcement.  Regarding

the rationale section of the announcement, the Committee’s characterization of the

labor market, and possibly of the economic outlook more generally, may be affected

by the release on Friday of the employment report for July.  If that report comes in

about as the staff expects, the Committee might wish to indicate, as under

Alternatives B and C, that “labor market conditions continue to improve.”  However, if the

report is again on the soft side, as in June, the Committee might wish to cite “some

slowing in the pace of improvement in labor market conditions,” as in Alternative A.

(9) Although the recent pace of economic growth has been less vigorous

than projected in the June Greenbook, the Committee may still judge that the

economy is poised for significant expansion going forward, as in the current staff

forecast.  Under this view, a gradual tightening of monetary policy should be

consistent with a pace of growth sufficient to make some headway in reducing

economic slack while keeping inflation well contained.  If the Committee subscribes

to such an outlook, it may find it appropriate to continue paring the degree of

monetary policy accommodation and thus be attracted to the 25-basis-point firming at

this meeting of Alternative B.  Policy likely will need to be firmed considerably over

time:  The real federal funds rate, measured as the difference between the nominal

funds rate and lagged four-quarter core PCE inflation, remains negative and below the

estimates of its equilibrium value implied by selected staff models (Chart 5).  And

given recent inflation trends, as well as the continued climb in crude oil prices in

recent weeks, a further tightening of policy might be viewed as desirable to reduce the

odds of an upturn in inflation expectations and more generally to help ensure that

core inflation does not rise above acceptable levels.  At the same time, the Committee

may believe that a gradual pace of policy adjustment will likely be sufficient to foster

achievement of its goals, particularly given the apparent persistence of economic slack,

which should help restrain inflation.  Also, the recent data may be read as hinting that

the sluggishness in spending of the past few months might prove more protracted

than forecast in the Greenbook, arguing for only a modest firming step at this

meeting.  Estimated policy rules generally suggest that a such a tightening at this

meeting would be consistent with the Committee’s past policy conduct (Chart 6).

(10) In announcing implementation of Alternative B, the Committee would

presumably want to modify its previous statement that “output is continuing to expand at a

solid pace” to acknowledge both the softness in economic activity in the past few

months and the potential effects on economic prospects of energy price

developments.  One way to accomplish this would be to note that “Although output

growth has moderated in recent months, the economy appears poised to expand at a solid pace going

forward absent significant further increases in energy prices.”  With regard to recent price

developments, core consumer inflation was subdued on a monthly basis in June

although the twelve-month inflation rate was higher than a year earlier.  The

Committee may wish to retain the sense of its previous announcement regarding

inflation while not putting excessive weight on the latest monthly data by saying

“Recent inflation data have been somewhat elevated, though a portion of the rise in prices evidently

reflects transitory factors.”  If the Committee finds the staff projection of aggregate

demand and supply conditions plausible, it could reiterate its previous assessment that

the risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability are balanced for

the next few quarters.  The Committee might again wish to communicate a view of

the likely pace of policy adjustment by stating that, “With underlying inflation still expected

to be relatively low . . . policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,”

while also retaining the indication that it would tighten at a faster pace if necessary to

maintain price stability.  

(11) Market participants apparently have viewed the incoming data, in the

context of the FOMC’s June announcement and the Chairman’s monetary policy

Committee on August 6, 2004.

testimony, as implying that the FOMC will firm policy another 25 basis points at this

meeting, again assess the risks to growth and inflation as balanced, and retain the

reference to a “measured pace.”  Moreover, a range of indicators continues to suggest

that investors generally remain well prepared for gradual policy tightening.4  Thus, the

market reaction to implementation of this alternative would likely be rather muted, as

in June.  However, the mention of crude oil prices as a factor potentially influencing

future economic growth could prompt investors to focus more closely on evolving

energy price developments in revising their expectations for monetary policy.

(12) If the Committee is concerned by the slow pace of progress in reducing

resource slack projected in the Greenbook or is worried that the forecasted rebound

in growth could fail to materialize, it may prefer the unchanged policy stance of

Alternative A.  The sluggish consumption spending of late and the still-limited pickup

in capital investment—even ahead of the expiration of the partial-expensing tax

provisions at year-end—might be read by policymakers as suggesting that aggregate

demand could remain soft for some time.  Such concerns about prospects for

economic activity could intensify if the labor market report for July turns out to be

surprisingly weak.  The possibility that business and consumer confidence could be

impaired by heightened terrorist threats might also be seen as posing some downside

risk to spending and output.  With inflation apparently moving down somewhat from

its elevated levels of earlier this year and inflation expectations apparently contained, a

brief hiatus in the process of firming policy might involve little risk of higher inflation

and would permit the accumulation of additional data that could be helpful in

assessing whether spending is rebounding in line with projections. 

(13) The announcement accompanying a decision to leave rates unchanged

could point to the evidence of “a moderation in output growth” and possibly, as mentioned

above, a slowing in the pace of improvement in labor market conditions.  The

inflation sentence could well be similar to that under Alternative B.  If FOMC



10

members are especially concerned that the recent weakness in spending might prove

persistent, they might consider an assessment that risks to sustainable growth are

weighted to the downside.  However, the Committee may judge that, especially given

the easing of market interest rates that would likely accompany an unchanged policy

stance, the risks to both sustainable growth and price stability would remain in

balance.  Assuming that the Committee still sees a need to move over time toward a

neutral stance, it probably would want to retain in the announcement the judgment

that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a “measured pace.”  Consistent with

its motivation for selecting Alternative A, the Committee might also wish to note that

policy will be adjusted as appropriate to promote “sustainable growth” as well as price

stability in the last sentence of the risk assessment section.

(14) Unless market expectations for the decision at this meeting are altered

substantially by a weak employment report for July, announcement of an unchanged

policy stance would come as a considerable surprise to investors and might trigger a

sizable drop in short-term interest rates, a rally in bond prices, and some depreciation

in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The drop in bond yields would tend to

support equity prices, but that influence could be offset if the policy announcement

led investors to believe that economic activity and corporate profits were likely to be

weaker than previously anticipated.  The declines in market interest rates and in the

dollar would likely be even more pronounced, and a fall in equity prices more likely, if

the FOMC provided an assessment of net downside risks to sustainable growth or

otherwise communicated concern about prospective economic weakness.

(15) If the Committee sees the recent slower growth of aggregate demand as

likely to be transitory but suspects that the pickup in core inflation could well be more

durable than the staff anticipates, it might choose to raise the funds rate 50 basis

points at this meeting, as in Alternative C.  FOMC members may consider inflation

already to be close to the top of an acceptable range and see several reasons to

question the decline in inflation in the staff forecast.  With inflation expectations

remaining in a 2 to 3 percent range, well above the Greenbook forecast, the

Committee may believe that underlying inflation has considerable momentum.  Also,



11

5 See “A Potential Change in the Wording of the Risk Assessment,” memorandum to
the Federal Open Market Committee from Vincent Reinhart, August 5, 2004.

high energy prices may prove to be longer lasting than anticipated by the staff forecast

and the markets, providing less downward pressure on overall inflation.  Policymakers

may see less slack in prospect than in the Greenbook projection, because they may

perceive the economy as already close to its potential or the growth rate of potential

output as lower than estimated by the staff.  Finally, Committee members might be

uneasy about inflation prospects if they place less weight on the most recent spending

indicators and foresee more robust growth in aggregate demand than in the staff

forecast, perhaps along the lines of the “Spending Rebound” scenario in the

Greenbook.  In light of these considerations, the FOMC may judge a 25-basis-point

move at this meeting—which would leave the real funds rate in negative territory—as

insufficient, whereas a 50-basis-point move would at least bring the real rate to around

zero.

(16) With market participants interpreting a “measured pace” as implying at

most 25-basis-point moves, policymakers probably would want to alter that phrase

significantly or drop it from an announcement of Alternative C.  While some

policymakers might prefer not to provide guidance about the likely pace of policy

change, they may be comfortable giving an indirect indication of its probable

direction.  If so, the last sentence of the announcement might read: “In current

circumstances, the Committee believes that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if sustained

over the next few quarters, could foster economic growth that is more likely to be above than below its

long-run sustainable pace.  Similarly, with respect to the Committee’s goal of price stability, such an

unchanged policy stance implies greater risks to the upside than the downside.” 5  Given the

explicit conditioning on the stance of policy in this assessment, a reference to the role

of monetary accommodation in the first sentence of the rationale paragraph would be

redundant.  That paragraph might instead begin: “The Committee continues to believe that

robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity.”  If the

Committee thinks that the “soft patch” in the economy is probably behind us and that



12

conditions are in place for a robust snap-back, it might also want to state that output

growth “appears poised to resume a stronger pace going forward.”  To underscore its concerns

about the effect of energy price increases on the inflation outlook, the Committee

might want to say: “Although a portion of the rise in inflation this year appears to have been due

to transitory factors, continuing and substantial increases in energy prices are putting persistent

upward pressure on costs and overall prices.”

(17) Unless the employment report for July turns out to be exceptionally

strong, market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of a 50-basis-

point move and the announcement proposed under Alternative C.  The assessment of

upside risks to growth and inflation and the deletion of the “measured pace”  language

would reinforce the sense that the trajectory of policy would be steeper than

previously anticipated.  Market interest rates would likely increase sharply, while stock

prices would drop and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would rise.

(18) If the Committee favors only a modest firming in policy at this time but

wishes to move away from the “measured pace” language before long, it might wish

to combine the 25-basis-point firming action and rationale of Alternative B

with the conditional assessment of upside risks proposed for Alternative C. 

That assessment would imply a need for continued policy tightening and thus could

facilitate dropping the measured pace language, perhaps even at this meeting.  If that

language were dropped on Tuesday, the market reaction to the announcement of

conditional upside risks could be fairly sharp, approaching that expected under

Alternative C, as market participants would probably conclude that the FOMC no

longer believed that policy tightening was likely to be gradual.  But if the “measured

pace” wording were retained for this meeting, the response might be rather muted,

with perhaps a small rise in market yields and a modest decline in equity prices.

Money and Debt Forecasts

(19) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is expected to continue to expand

at a subdued pace, averaging only around 1¼ percent from July through December. 

Historical evidence indicates that deposit interest rates are likely to respond sluggishly

to rising short-term market rates, leading to a widening of the opportunity cost of



13

holding monetary assets.  As a consequence, households are expected to shift their

portfolios away from deposits and toward market instruments.  The lagged effects on

deposit balances of the continuing slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity are also

expected to damp money growth, but to declining degree in the months ahead.

(20) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is forecast to slow to a

7 percent pace over the second half of this year.  Household debt should decelerate as

higher mortgage rates slow residential investment and home price appreciation.  By

contrast, business borrowing is expected to increase as internal funds fail to keep pace

with rising capital expenditures and as equity retirements quicken with increased

merger activity.  Federal debt growth is expected to moderate somewhat from its

robust first half pace, but budget deficits are projected to remain sizable.  As the fiscal

positions of state and local governments continue to improve, and with long-term

interest rates expected to remain about flat, growth of state and local debt should slow

further.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(21) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to

those presented in Table 1 are provided below.

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate

at/TO an average of around _______ 1¼ percent.

(2) Risk Assessments

A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few

quarters are roughly equal.  With underlying inflation still expected to be

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to

fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth.

B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few

quarters are roughly equal.  With underlying inflation still expected to be

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to

fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

C. In current circumstances, the Committee believes that the existing

degree of policy accommodation, if sustained over the next few quarters,

could foster economic growth that is more likely to be above than below



15

its long-run sustainable pace.  Similarly, with respect to the Committee’s

goal of price stability, such an unchanged policy stance implies greater

risks to the upside than the downside.
