MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Class I - FOMC June 30, 1994

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments 1

(1) At the conclusion of the May 17 FOMC meeting, the

Federal Reserve issued a press release stating that the Board had

voted to raise the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2 percent and that the

Committee had decided that this change should pass through fully to

reserve market conditions. The press release also indicated that

these and earlier actions were viewed by policymakers as substantially

removing the degree of monetary accommodation that had prevailed

during 1993. The intended federal funds rate was increased 1/2 per-

centage point, to 4-1/4 percent, where it remained over the inter-

meeting period.2 Over that span, the federal funds rate has traded

close to its intended level.

(2) As shown in the upper left panel of Chart 1, interest

rates beyond the three-month maturity moved lower immediately follow-

ing the announcement of the System's action.3 Apparently, the size

of the change in reserve market conditions and its implementation by a

hike in the discount rate, as well as the wording of the associated

press release, suggested to market participants that the Committee

would not be raising rates in the next few months as quickly as they

1. Financial market quotations in this section are taken as of
noon, Thursday, June 30.

2. Given the full pass-through of the discount rate to the funds
rate, the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was
initially kept unchanged at $175 million. Later in the intermeeting
period, the seasonal upswing in borrowing necessitated two increases
of $25 million and one of $100 million, bringing the allowance to its
current level of $325 million. Over the intermeeting period,
borrowing averaged close to its allowance.

3. A move of this magnitude had not been fully anticipated by
markets, and some very short-term rates notched higher. Major
commercial banks raised their prime rate 1/2 percentage point, to
7-1/4 percent.

had previously anticipated; these revisions in expectations can be

seen in the federal funds futures rates in the first two columns of

the upper right panel of the chart. Lessened uncertainty about the

timing and extent of subsequent policy action, as suggested by the

decline in a forward-looking measure of the volatility of bond prices

(the lower left panel), seemed to reduce risk premiums embedded in

longer-maturity rates. Moreover, market participants may have been

encouraged that timely action would reduce the degree of tightening

needed later. As a consequence, in contrast to the response to pre-

vious tightenings, forward rates all along the term structure moved

down, as evidenced by the parallel shift in the coupon yield curve

(the lower right panel).

(3) For several weeks following the FOMC meeting, financial

markets generally at least preserved the price gains that were posted

on May 17. In part encouraged by sluggish spending indicators, favor-

able readings on inflation, and statements of Federal Reserve offi-

cials, the sense that policy was temporarily on hold gained a firmer

footing among market participants, and federal funds futures rates

edged lower. In the last few weeks of the intermeeting period, how-

ever, bond yields have risen about 1/4 percentage point in often

volatile trading, in part as the sizable decline in the dollar's value

on exchange markets suggested additional pressures on prices and

possibly higher inflation expectations. These developments, in turn,

were interpreted to have increased the likelihood of near-term mone-

tary policy action and raised the level of uncertainty, perhaps feed-

ing through to higher risk premiums. On balance, intermediate- and

longer-term rates ended the intermeeting period a bit above where they

had begun. Most major equity indexes, which were up early in the



period and then moved lower later in sympathy with bond prices and the

dollar, lost 1 percent over the intermeeting period.

(4) The dollar's weighted average exchange value declined

3-3/4 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Essentially

all of this decline occurred after early June, reflecting evidence of

stronger growth abroad and associated increases in foreign bond

yields, as well as increasing concerns about potential inflationary

pressures in the U.S. economy. The shrinking prospects for any pro-

gress in U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations in light of the uncertain

political situation in Japan also tended to strengthen the yen against

the dollar. While short-term rates abroad were little changed,

foreign long-term interest rates rose 55 basis points, on average.

U.S. monetary authorities sold $1,560 million equivalent of yen and

marks in concerted operations on June 24.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates over May and

June now appears to be considerably weaker than was thought at the

time of the previous FOMC meeting. M2 fell at an average rate of

1-1/2 percent over those two months, as compared with the modest de-

celeration that had been anticipated. Capital markets appear to have

retained considerably more appeal to investors than we had thought

would be the case. The exodus from bond funds that had begun when the

System moved toward restraint in February came to a halt by the end of

May, and flows turned positive in June, albeit well below the volumes

recorded over much of last year; inflows to equity funds picked up as

the intermeeting period progressed. In addition, declines in mortgage

refinancing were greater than expected, with associated depressing

effects on liquid deposits.



(6) More generally, M2 appears to have been significantly

restrained by the increases in short-term rates thus far this year.

Households have withdrawn funds from liquid deposits and money market

funds, only some of which have been redeposited in small time depos-

its. Growth of M2 and, in particular, its small time deposit com-

ponent has been held down by the apparent reluctance of depositories

to increase their offering rates by as much as past episodes of rising

market rates would have suggested. The relative attractiveness of

assets outside the standard monetary aggregates is suggested by the

sizable pickup in net noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions, as

well as continued flows into bond and stock mutual funds.4  The

effects of rising opportunity costs were particularly evident on Ml,

which grew at only a 3-1/4 percent rate over May and June, despite a

pickup in currency growth to a 10 percent rate.5  The sluggish

performance of M2 over the past two months has brought the aggregate

to near the lower arm of its target cone. The 1.1 percent growth rate

for M2 from the fourth quarter of 1993 to June was about one-half the

pace anticipated for that period in the January bluebook. The short-

fall largely reflected the effects on opportunity costs of the Sys-

tem's tightening, which significantly outstripped the policy firming

incorporated in the January forecast.

4. M2 plus stock and bond funds is estimated to have fallen at a
3/4 percent rate over May and June, pulling down its growth from the
fourth quarter of 1993 to June to 1 percent. Capital losses have
lowered growth of M2-plus by an estimated 1-1/2 percentage points
since the fourth quarter.

5. By June. M1 had expanded at about a 4 percent rate above its
level in the fourth quarter of last year. The institution of a retail
sweep program at shifted about $8 billion from Ml and
into M2, pulling M1 growth down about 1 percentage point at an annual
rate in the first half of 1994. From the fourth quarter of last year
through June, total reserves declined at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate,
while the monetary base, supported by strong demands for currency,
particularly from abroad, expanded at a 9 percent rate.



(7) M3 declined at an average rate of 1-3/4 percent over May

and June. Within the non-M2 portion of M3, institutional money market

mutual funds have run off sharply, as investors, impatient with the

lagged adjustment of their yields to market rates, have increasingly

turned to open market instruments. Counterbalancing this somewhat,

banks have issued more large CDs over the past two months on net to

offset some of the decline in retail deposits and a slowing in borrow-

ing from overseas branches. All told, the decrease in the broad

aggregate over the past two months places M3 just below its 0-to-4

percent annual growth range. The standstill in M3 from the fourth

quarter of 1993 to June is in contrast to the staff's expectation in

the January bluebook that the broad aggregate would advance at a 1-1/2

percent rate over that period. Bank credit has expanded at a 6-1/4

percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1993 to June, about in line

with the staff's projection in January after abstracting from the

effects of accounting rule changes.6  In retrospect, however,

depositories have chosen to rely more on nondeposit sources than we

had anticipated, reflecting a wider cost advantage favoring Eurodollar

borrowing.

(8) The rise in long-term interest rates has sharply cur-

tailed the refinancing of high-cost debt by households, businesses,

and state and local governments and has shifted net borrowing away

from long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Net borrowing by these

sectors, however, continued in April and May at about its previous

pace of 4-1/2 percent. The enthusiasm of households to borrow has

6. The entire $25 billion increase in the "other securities"
component of bank credit in the first half of the year, or about one-
half of the total pickup in investment accounts, owed to the
application of a new accounting standard that limited banks' ability
to net off-balance sheet items. This added 1-1/2 percentage points to
the annual rate of expansion of bank credit.



shown little sign of letting up: Consumer credit appears to have

expanded at a brisk pace in May and June, based on bank data adjusted

for securitizations. Net mortgage borrowing has slowed only a touch.

despite the drop in gross flows, with a growing share at adjustable

rates. Overall business borrowing also has edged lower and remains

concentrated at banks and finance companies rather than in the bond

markets. On balance, from the fourth quarter of 1993 through May,

nonfederal debt grew at about a 5 percent rate and total nonfinancial

debt at about a 5-1/4 percent rate. This placed total debt in the

lower half of its 4-to-8 percent monitoring range.

Alternative Long-Run Scenarios

(9) This section addresses several issues related to the

conduct of monetary policy over the next several years. The first set

of simulations considers the effects of alternative monetary policies,

given the staff's assessment of the strength of aggregate demand and

associated inflation pressures. The next two sets show the conse-

quences of different assumptions about the natural rate of unemploy-

ment and underlying demand. The baseline scenario, to which the

alternatives are compared in all the simulations, embodies the Green-

book forecast through 1995 and a judgmental extension thereafter. The

effects of differences in assumptions relative to the baseline under

each alternative were derived using staff econometric models of the

U.S. and foreign economies.

(10) These scenarios have been developed within a framework

that contains several key assumptions. On the supply side, the change

in the inflation rate is related mainly to the gap between the natural

rate of unemployment and the actual rate; a 1 percentage point gap,

when maintained for a year, reduces the actual rate of inflation by

about 1/2 percentage point per year. The natural rate of

unemployment is about 6-1/4 percent (except where assumed otherwise in

the second set of scenarios), and potential GDP grows at about a 2-1/2

percent rate over the remainder of the decade.8  On the demand

side, the fiscal stance of the federal government follows the

Greenbook projections of the federal deficit out through 1995:Q4 when

7. The credibility of monetary policy is assumed to have no
special effect on inflation.

8. This measure of the natural rate is on the new basis. The wedge
between the old and new CPS surveys is assumed to be about 1/3
percentage point (a smaller wedge than estimated earlier in the year).
On the old basis, the natural rate is estimated to be about
5.9 percent.



the deficit is projected to be 2-1/2 percent of nominal GDP. It is

assumed that actions are taken subsequently that reduce the deficit to

1-1/2 percent of nominal GDP by 1999:Q4. The money growth projection

is based on a gradual return to a more typical alignment with that of

nominal income; the forces disrupting this relationship are assumed to

ebb as the yield curve returns to a more normal slope and portfolios

become more fully adjusted to the enhanced availability of bond and

stock mutual funds.

(11) In the baseline scenario, policy acts to keep inflation

at 3 percent. (The table below and Chart 2 give the results for the

baseline and tighter policy scenarios.) This outcome requires un-

employment to remain in the neighborhood of its recent levels, which

are judged to be around its natural rate. The real federal funds rate

needs to rise by another percentage point to about 2-1/4 percent--a

little above its assumed longer-run neutral level. The higher level

of the real funds rate offsets some of the prospective strength in

aggregate demand and inflation pressures arising in part from the

decline in the exchange value of the dollar. The associated increase

in the nominal federal funds rate in the staff forecast--to 5-1/4

percent by early 1995--is roughly in line with what is expected in the

market for this period and should keep long-term interest rates--both

real and nominal--close to their recent readings into 1995. The

dollar is projected to remain at about its current level through the

forecast period. After 1995, the funds rate can be brought down some,

and gradually declining long-term real rates in the out years offset

the effects on aggregate demand of continuing fiscal restraint.

9. The paths for M2 were determined judgmentally, though informed
by several staff econometric models.

(12) Under the tighter alternative, the Committee strives to

bring CPI inflation down to around 1-1/2 percent--close to effective

price stability--by the end of the decade. Achieving this outcome

requires a considerably tighter policy stance over the next two years

than in the baseline. Lower money growth and higher real interest

rates, with the real federal funds rate moving above 4-1/2 percent by

the end of 1995, pushes the unemployment rate a little over 7 percent

for a time. To avoid falling below the inflation objective late in

the period, policy needs to be eased substantially in 1996, with a

marked decline in short-term interest rates and step-up in money

growth, so that the unemployment rate is approaching the natural rate

at the end of the simulation period.

(13) Different assumptions about the level of the natural

rate of unemployment, along with policy responses to the resulting

economic conditions, are embedded in the simulations shown in Chart 3.

The baseline simulation is the same as in Chart 2 above and retains

the assumption that the natural rate of unemployment is 6-1/4 percent.

In light of considerable uncertainty about the precise level of the

natural rate, however, the two alternatives incorporate natural rates

that are either 1/2 percentage point higher or lower over the forecast

period. In the case of a lower natural rate of unemployment, monetary

policy needs to reduce the real interest rate to bring spending in

line with the higher level of potential GDP. However, the Committee

is assumed to recognize and respond to the unexpectedly low natural

rate only as inflation falls perceptibly short of the path in the

baseline simulation. The unemployment rate remains above the lower

level of the natural rate for a time, and the Committee takes

advantage of the opportunity presented by this circumstance to make

lasting progress toward price stability. In contrast, a half-point

higher natural rate means that the economy is already producing above

capacity and an accelerating inflation process is underway. To

contain this process, the Committee needs to tighten to bring the

unemployment rate to its higher natural level; in the simulation, the

Committee tightens even more to avoid a permanently higher inflation

rate, implying a period of slack in the economy.

(14) The third set of simulations, shown in Chart 4, con-

siders the implications of stronger or weaker aggregate demand than in

the staff forecast. The aggregate demand shocks embody a one percent

higher or lower level of real spending (relative to the baseline

forecast) by the first quarter of next year. As the positive shock to

demand becomes evident in the data, the Committee moves the federal

funds rate up, though owing to uncertainty about the size and

persistence of the shock, rates do not rise rapidly enough to

forestall a dip in the unemployment rate, to below the natural rate,

and a rise in inflation for a time. The negative shock to aggregate

demand induces the Committee to keep the federal funds rate unchanged

through 1995. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate rises above its

natural rate, and inflation decelerates.

Long-Run Ranges

money and debt for 1994 and 1995, the table below presents the current

realized through June and projected for 1994 and 1995.10

(16) The staff projections of money and debt are intended to

be consistent with the economic and financial market forecast describ-

ed in the Greenbook. Growth in nominal GDP is seen as slowing over

the second half of this year to a 5 percent rate before leveling out

at a 4-1/2 percent pace over next year. Monetary policy is assumed to

move the federal funds rate up to around 5-1/4 percent by the begin-

ning of next year and hold it at that level for the balance of 1995.

By contrast, long-term interest rates are expected to remain near

current levels this year before moving down somewhat next year.

10. Ranges for previous years and outcomes are shown in Appendix A.



-14-

(17) Over the last six months of 1994, M2 growth is projected

to maintain its 1 percent pace of the year to date. Moderating expan-

sion of nominal GDP and previous as well as projected increases in

opportunity costs will be exerting additional restraint on demand for

M2 in the second half of the year. The rise in opportunity costs

results not only from the assumed increase in short-term market inter-

est rates but also from a continued unusually sluggish response of

depositories in raising retail deposit rates; loan growth is seen as

moderate and banks may prefer to limit acquisitions of securities or

to issue managed liabilities rather than raising offering rates

aggressively to the broad base of retail customers.11 As an offset

to these influences, declines in mortgage prepayments are anticipated

to wane, reducing their depressing effects on money growth. 12 Port-

folio shifts between capital market investments and deposits are a

persisting source of uncertainty for future money growth. After the

experience of the first half of the year, households likely have a

more realistic assessment of the risks of holding long-term mutual

funds. The staff forecast of relatively stable long-term rates over

the balance of the year suggests no significant further capital

losses, and we do not project additional net withdrawals from bond

11. With higher opportunity costs, narrow measures of transactions
balances, base money, and reserves are projected to put in a subdued
performance over the second half of 1994. For the four quarters of
the year, M1 is projected to grow by 3-1/2 percent, buoyed by 10-1/2
percent growth of currency, while transaction deposits post only a 3/4
percent gain. Required and total reserves are projected to be about
flat. Largely reflecting the growth of currency, the monetary base
grows 8-3/4 percent for the year.

12. Decreases in the level of mortgage prepayments, which depress
demand deposits and money market deposit accounts, reduced M2 growth
by an estimated 1 percentage point at an annual rate from the fourth
quarter to June. A reduction in M2 growth of 1/2 percentage point
owing to these effects is projected for June to December. With
mortgage rates remaining well above last year's lows, prepayments
should have little effect on money growth in 1995.



-15-

funds. However, a flatter term structure will narrow yield differen-

tials favoring bond mutual funds. With the reduced yield incentive

and better investor appreciation of risks, we are projecting that

inflows into bond and stock mutual funds will remain substantially

below the record pace of last year.13 M2 velocity is projected to

increase over the second half of the year at the same average pace as

since mid-1991. (See Chart 5.)

(18) M3 over the rest of 1994 is expected to remain little

changed from its level in the fourth quarter of last year. Bank

credit is likely to expand over the next six months somewhat below its

pace for the year to date (abstracting from the effects on "other

securities" of the accounting change that did not alter bank financing

needs). The slowing reflects reduced acquisitions of government

securities, as projected loan growth rises gradually. However, in

light of prospects for stronger credit demands in foreign economies,

banks' funding preferences will likely shift toward large time depos-

its and away from borrowing from offices abroad, thereby supporting

the growth of M3.

(19) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected

by the staff to continue growing at about a 5 percent rate over the

remainder of the year, keeping this aggregate in the lower half of its

4 to 8 percent monitoring range. Federal debt is expected to expand

6 percent this year, while nonfederal debt appears to be on a 4-3/4

percent growth track, a bit below the pace of nominal GDP expansion.

In the household sector, consumer borrowing should ease a bit from its

recent brisk pace, while mortgage borrowing remains restrained by the

13. M2 plus households' nonretirement holdings of bond and stock
mutual funds are projected to grow somewhat faster than M2 over the
second half of 1994 and the year as a whole.

topping out of the housing market and lessened "cash outs" of equity

as refinancing activity declines further. With the gap between cor-

porate financing needs and internally generated funds widening some,

business borrowing may firm a little; in contrast to 1993, companies

are likely to rely substantially on both short- and long-term debt

sources. On the supply side of the credit markets, conditions should

remain quite favorable. Narrow quality spreads are likely to persist

in securities markets, and banks and other intermediaries may become

even more aggressive in pursuit of lending opportunities as the eco-

nomic expansion continues at a good pace.

(20) In 1995, growth of nonfinancial sector debt is projected

to hold at a 5 percent rate. Federal debt growth edges up to a 6-1/2

percent pace, but a slight easing of nonfederal debt expansion,

reflecting slower growth in nominal spending, serves as an offset.

With opportunity costs essentially flattening, M2 growth is expected

to pick up--to 2 percent--despite capital gains on bond funds and the

slight further downshift in growth of nominal GDP. The faster M2

expansion partly shows through to M3, which is projected to resume

growing at a 1 percent rate. 14

Ranges for 1994

(21) Although in recent years the Committee has de-emphasized

monetary and debt aggregates as policy guides, the selection of par-

ticular ranges does impart to the Congress and the public the Commit-

tee's sense of the prospective growth of these financial quantities

14. In 1995, M1 decelerates to a 1 percent growth rate, in part
owing to substitutions out of M1 and into nontransaction components of
M2, as the average interest rate on M1 changes little, while rates on
retail time deposits, money funds, and money market deposit accounts
rise substantially. With required and total reserves falling at a
little more than a 1-1/2 percent rate, the monetary base is expected
to slow to a 5-1/2 percent pace for the year.



-17-

that is likely to be consistent with the economic outlook of the

Governors and Presidents. The table below shows two alternative sets

of ranges for money and debt growth over 1994. Alternative I repre-

sents the current ranges, while alternative II reduces the upper and

lower bounds of all three ranges by 1 percentage point. The alterna-

tive II ranges for M2 and M3 better encompass the staff projections,

and the center of the alternative II range for debt corresponds to the

staff forecast.

Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1994
(percent)

Alt. I Memo:
(current Staff
ranges) Alt. II Projection

M2 1 to 5 0 to 4 1
M3 0 to 4 -1 to 3 0
Debt 4 to 8 3 to 7 5

(22) Alternative II might be chosen not on the technical

grounds used last year of a shift in money demand, but rather to allow

more comfortably for the effects on money growth of further increases

in short-term interest rates, as in the staff forecast. That is,

growth of the money and debt aggregates under this alternative is less

likely to fall below the lower ends of these ranges, even if the staff

has underestimated either the depressing impact of further increases

in the federal funds rate or the prospective underlying weakness in

money and credit relative to nominal GDP. Alternative II would also

seem to provide scope for an even more pronounced tightening in policy

than assumed by the staff, should the Committee wish to lean toward

still more policy restraint. Such restraint on demand might be sought

to return to a path of disinflation--as in the tighter strategy of the



-18-

last section--or could become necessary should an untoward deprecia-

tion of the exchange value of the dollar threaten a general inflation-

ary upturn.

(23) Alternative I could be seen as more consistent with a

judgment that relatively stable short-term interest rates will ade-

quately foster attainment of the FOMC's objectives for the economy and

inflation. The associated forecast for money and debt would involve

faster growth rates this year than in the staff projections, placing

their probable levels late in the year more clearly within their cur-

rent ranges. The alternative I ranges also could be viewed as a long-

run benchmark for money growth consonant with the attainment of nomi-

nal GDP expansion over time consistent with price stability and the

return to a more normal behavior of M2 velocity. Even if such veloc-

ity behavior does not emerge soon, keeping the current ranges in place

rather than lowering them could avoid the necessity of an upward

adjustment of the ranges in the future, which could be misperceived as

a weakening of the Committee's anti-inflationary resolve. An under-

shoot of the current ranges this year could perhaps be explained by

the continued aberrant behavior of velocity.

Ranges for 1995

(24) Two alternative ranges for money and debt growth over

1995, the same as those for 1994. are shown below along with the staff

projections for money and debt growth.

-19-

(25) Many of the same considerations relating to the choice

of the ranges this year apply to the selection of provisional ranges

for next year. To be sure, the staff's projected stepup in M2 and M3

growth places both aggregates further within the alternative I ranges,

reducing the risk of an undershoot. However, considerable uncertain-

ties remain regarding the portfolio behavior of households and the

sensitivity of money balances to the structure of interest rates. In

addition, the behavior of interest rates that will be needed to pro-

mote the Committee's macroeconomic objectives in 1995 is, of course,

unclear. Given these uncertainties affecting velocity, a case can be

made for carrying over to 1995 whichever set of ranges is selected for

1994, with the intention to reassess the 1995 ranges again next Febru-

ary.



-20-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(26) Three alternatives for the near-term stance of policy

are presented below for consideration by the Committee. Under alter-

native B, federal funds would continue to trade around 4-1/4 percent

and the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing would remain

at $325 million. 15 The federal funds rate would be boosted 1/4

percentage point to 4-1/2 percent under alternative C, and the borrow-

ing allowance would be raised to $350 million. Alternative D would

increase the federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 percent.

(27) The staff forecast of rising interest rates does not

necessarily assume tightening at this meeting, but would seem to call

for aggressive action later in the quarter should underlying demand

for goods and services turn out to be as strong as implied in the

staff outlook. Alternative B might be chosen by the Committee if it

wished to await confirmation of the strength of aggregate demand,

perhaps because there were questions about whether that strength would

in fact be forthcoming. This alternative might also be preferred if

the Committee felt the staff had overestimated probable inflationary

pressures. Market participants seem somewhat uncertain about the

likelihood of Committee action at the July meeting; some anticipate

that the Federal Reserve will pause a little longer in its process of

firming to assess the effects of its actions so far, but on balance

they seem to have put the odds on a quarter-point move at greater than

50-50. Accordingly, short-term interest rates are likely to move down

a little after the meeting under alternative B. Long-term rates are

not likely to decline, however, under this alternative; the dollar

15. Under all of the alternatives, increases in the borrowing
allowance would likely be needed over the intermeeting period to
accommodate rising demands for seasonal credit.



-21-

might remain under some downward pressure, and the markets might

continue to focus on the potential for greater inflation, especially

if data confirm brisk growth.

(28) The Committee could see alternative C as appropriate if

it believed that sufficient evidence had accumulated to warrant a

continued gradual tightening of policy to prevent the economy from

overheating. Because the 25-basis-point firming in the federal funds

rate under this alternative is not fully incorporated in current mar-

ket quotes, other short-term interest rates would probably edge up in

response. This action could provide some support for the dollar;

however, if it were undertaken in the context of a seriously weakening

dollar, and were seen as intended primarily to prop up the currency,

it could well be viewed by the market as insufficient. That circum-

stance aside, greater market confidence that inflation pressures might

be restrained could help limit increases in intermediate- and long-

term interest rates in response to this alternative. With market

portfolios now generally aligned to expectations of gradually rising

money market interest rates, the move seems unlikely to prompt further

increases in actual and implied volatility in bond markets.

(29) Concerns that the recent behavior of the dollar and

commodity prices might imply rising prices more broadly and might be

associated with a ratcheting up of inflation expectations could moti-

vate the Committee to select alternative D. The 50-basis-point hike

in the funds rate would be seen by market participants as motivated

importantly by a desire to bolster the dollar, which might well

recover some of its recent losses, especially if the action were

implemented through a hike in the discount rate. If the dollar did

rebound and the action were seen as lowering the odds on a pickup of



-22-

inflation, any increases in bond yields could be quite limited. On

the other hand, such an action is not currently anticipated in the

market and could prompt increased uncertainty about the future path of

interest rates, with adverse effects on bond and possibly stock

markets. In any case, banks would be likely to match the increase in

the federal funds rate with a similar hike in the prime rate.

(30) Growth of the monetary aggregates under the three

alternatives is presented in the table below. (The table and charts

on the next three pages contain more detail on the projections.)

Under all of the alternatives, M2 growth from June to September is

expected to be in a narrow range around a 1-1/2 percent rate and M3 at

or just above a 1/2 percent rate. Such growth rates would represent

some pickup from the surprisingly weak performance over the March-to-

June period. In effect, we are projecting that the relationships of

money to income and interest rates prevailing over recent years will

reassert themselves. All the alternatives would leave M2 in September

a bit above the lower end of its 1-to-5 percent annual range and M3 at

the lower edge of its 0-to-4 percent range.

Growth from June
to September

M2 1-3/4 1-1/2 1-1/4
M3 3/4 1/2 1/2
M1 3-1/2 3 2-1/2

(31) As noted in the previous section, M2 growth will be

restrained by the slower pace of nominal income growth projected by

the staff in the third quarter as well as by the effects of the pre-

vious and expected further widening of opportunity costs. Moreover,

the volume of flows into bond and stock funds is expected to pick up a

little as concerns about capital losses in these markets diminish. 16

Partly offsetting these influences should be the gradual levelling out

of mortgage refinancing activity. With interest rates on small CDs

rising more quickly than those on liquid deposits, inflows to small

time deposits should account for an appreciable proportion of M2

growth. Although currency growth also is expected to remain rapid

owing to continued strength in foreign demands, transaction deposits

are expected to be about flat on balance, as average yields below 2

percent on NOW accounts limit flows into other checkable deposits and

as compensating balances fall in response to increases in earnings

credit rates. M1 is expected to increase at only a 3-1/2 percent rate

from June to September under alternative B.17

(32) Expansion of M3 is projected to pick up only slightly in

the next few months. Funding needs of depository institutions should

remain moderate. Under the staff forecast, bank credit expands at

about a 4 percent rate over the second half of the year, with total

loan growth rising a little while securities acquisitions fall off;

the expansion of thrift balance sheets picks up only slowly.

Institution-only money fund shares are likely to continue to decline

in response to increasing yields on direct money-market holdings,

particularly under alternatives C and D. However, banks may slow

their reliance on borrowing from foreign offices and step up issuance

of domestic CDs, contributing a little to growth of M3. Overall debt

16. M2 plus bond and stock'mutual funds is projected to increase
over coming months at a slightly faster rate than M2.

17. In association with the anemic performance of transaction
deposits, total reserves are projected to decline at about a 2 percent
rate over the June-to-September period. The monetary base would
expand at a 7-1/4 percent rate.

growth is projected to remain close to 5 percent over the remainder of

Directive Language

(33) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

directive wording relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1994 and

1995 and the operational paragraph for the intermeeting period.

Paragraph for 1994 and 1995 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary

and financial conditions that will foster price stability

and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance

of these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS its

meeting THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED in February

established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 per-

cent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the

fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. [IN

FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT THIS

MEETING LOWERED/RAISED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN

FEBRUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO RANGES OF ____ TO ____ AND

____ TO ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 1993 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1994.] The

Committee anticipated that developments contributing to

unusual velocity increases could persist during the year

and that money growth within these ranges would be consis-

tent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring

range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was

set MAINTAINED at 4 to 8 percent [LOWERED/RAISED TO ___ TO

____ PERCENT] for the year. FOR 1995, THE COMMITTEE AGREED

ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1994 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1995, OF ____



-27-

TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE

COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED MONITORING RANGE

FOR GROWTH OF DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ____ TO ____ PER-

CENT FOR 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates

will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress

toward price level stability, movements in their veloci-

ties, and developments in the economy and financial mar-

kets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/MAINTAIN/

increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions [DEL: , taking account of a possible increase in

the discount rate]. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint MIGHT/WOULD or slightly

(SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD) be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with

modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

led M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in
1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect on
growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and
more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth and in-
creased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the tar-
get ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted ranges,
were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average level through the fourth quar-
ter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had adopted
a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985 meeting, the FOMC had adopted
a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its underly-
ing relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to 1 to 5
percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3, and
4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4 percent
for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1993 QIV to June 1994 and for nonfinancial debt are
from 1993 QIV to May 1994.
