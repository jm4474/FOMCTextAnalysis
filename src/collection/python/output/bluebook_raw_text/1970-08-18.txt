MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) The money supply is now estimated to have increased at a

4.1 per cent annual rate on average in July, much slower than the 11 per

cent pace indicated at the time of the last Committee meeting. Since

around mid-July, the weekly money supply figures have been generally

smaller than earlier anticipated, though the shortfall has lessened in

August and in the week ending August 12, the preliminary estimate for the

money supply moved slightly above its indicated path. For the most part

the shortfalls in money supply reflected weakness in private demand deposits

subject to reserves at both city and country banks, but currency and

estimated demand deposits at nonmember banks also fell short./ Apparently,

the surge in demand balances around mid-year was a very temporary phenomenon,

perhaps resulting from market churning associated with shifts of funds out

of market instruments thought to be of less than prime quality.

(2) Growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy in July was at

a slightly more rapid pace than had been expected earlier. This greater

strength was due primarily to a faster-than-projected rise in time deposits,

which grew at a 35 per cent annual rate on average in July. Large CD's

rose by around $5.0 billion over the month following the suspension of a

1/ There have been some indications of the development recently of new
bank accounting procedures in connection with Euro-dollar and foreign ex-
change transactions which could be producing some understatement in the
money supply series. No hard statistics are available, however, to confirm
the extent of such a bias if it does exist, whether it is growing or
represents a one-time change, or whether it is or isn't offset by other
factors.

portion of the Regulation Q ceilings, although more recent data indicate

a considerably more moderate rate of CD expansion. Other time and savings

deposits also advanced strongly in July, possibly reflecting a preference

by savers for highly liquid instruments in view of economic and financial

uncertainties. Net inflows of funds to nonbank savings institutions were

also exceptionally strong after allowance for seasonal factors.

(3) The Treasury's mid-August financing was generally

successful raising $1.9 billion in new cash, according to preliminary

figures. Despite the success of the financing and the initial premiums

on the new issues, the Government securities market remains hesitant

in the face of enlarged dealer positions arising from the Treasury's two

tax bill auctions in July and takings of about $1.4 billion in coupon

issues in the mid-August operation. Thus, yields on Treasury notes and

bonds have edged up and are about 7--10 basis points over mid-July

levels. Treasury bill rates have also moved somewhat higher, and the

3-month issue was most recently bid at 6.54 per cent, compared with 6.38

per cent at the time of the last meeting.

(4) Yields on new high-grade corporate issues have fluctuated

since mid-July, and on balance are a shade higher than at the time of the

last FOMC meeting, reflecting a recent build-up in the corporate calendar.

On the other hand, yields on municipal securities have dropped. Private

short-term rates have also declined since mid-July; and these markets

have calmed considerably, although the market remains very quality-

conscious and marginal issuers of commercial paper are still being pressed

to seek alternative sources of credit. Major finance companies are now

having relatively little difficulty in meeting maturities, although some

are finding it hard to add to outstandings. Nevertheless, as reported in

the Greenbook, total outstanding commercial and finance paper continued to

decline in July, a month in which seasonal factors would imply a sizable

increase.



(5) In response to the System's discount window assistance

to banks extending additional credit to commercial paper issuers, member

bank borrowings rose sharply in July reaching a record $1.7 billion on

average in the week of July 15. Over the past three statement weeks,

however, member bank borrowings have been in a $1--$1.2 billion range,

at a time when pressures on the commercial paper market have been abat-

ing. Net borrowed reserves fluctuated in a $1.1--$1.4 billion range in

the latter part of July, but in the first two statement weeks of August

dropped below $1.0 billion; in June, before the commercial paper problem

developed, net borrowed reserves had averaged $735 million.

(6) Since the last Committee meeting, the Federal funds rate

has averaged a little below 7 per cent, as compared with the 7-1/4--

7-1/2 per cent range of the preceding four weeks. In part, the lower

Federal funds rate reflected increased ability of banks to accommodate

reserve needs at the discount window. In addition, however, the drop in

the funds rate, and also dealer financing rates, reflected the Desk's

response to shortfalls in money supply growth.

Prospective developments

(8) If the Committee wishes to continue with a policy that

encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per

cent trend rate of growth for the money supply, the following language for

the second paragraph of the directive may be considered (alternative A):

To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of persisting

market uncertainties; liquidity strains; and the forthcoming Treasury

financing;] the Committee seeks to promote moderate growth in money

and bank credit over the months ahead, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF

PERSISTING LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND allowing [DEL: for a possible] BANK

CREDIT GROWTH TO REFLECT A continued shift of credit flows from market

to banking channels. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining

bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with that objective;

[DEL: provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to

counter excessive pressures in financial markets should they develop.]

(9) The table below shows growth paths for the monetary

aggregates that would be consistent with such a policy.

(10) The growth rate specified above might not be attainable under

prevailing money market conditions, particularly with respect to the money

supply. Although the relationship between money market conditions and

monetary aggregates has been unusually uncertain recently, our projections

indicate that the money supply might grow at no more than a 4 per cent annual

rate over the third quarter and into the fourth if current money market

conditions are generally maintained. Achievement of a 5 per cent money

supply growth might require a Federal funds rate generally around 6-1/2--

6-3/4 per cent, member bank borrowings dropped to an average of around

$800-$900 million, and net borrowed reserves were in a $700-$800 million



-8-

range. Such a set of money market conditions might be accompanied by some

decline of interest rates in short-term credit markets in consequence of

greater provision of nonborrowed reserves by the System. The 3-month bill

rate would probably decline in a 6-1/8--6-1/2 per cent range. It is

possible, also, that if the Federal funds rate had to be consiztently around

6-1/2 per cent to achieve the money supply growth, expectational factors

could be generated which could increase bank and other investor demands for

debt obligations. This might lead to interest rate declines on a broader

front, although the extent of decline may be limited by the size of

security offerings in prospect.

(11) Time deposit growth is likely to slow over the months

ahead even if the easier money market conditions noted above prove necessary.

It seems unlikely that the very rapid rate of growth of consumer-type time

deposits in July will continue, assuming that economic prospects begin to

improve. With respect to large negotiable CD's, the recent more moderate

pace of expansion is likely to continue. Further short-term market rate

declines would tend to make CD's relatively more attractive to investors,

but, with loan demands quite moderate, banks would be unlikely to be as

aggressive in the CD market as in July. This same consideration is

likely to limit bank interest in nondeposit sources of funds.

(13) Should the Committee wish to seek a somewhat more rapid

pace of growth for the money supply and an associated easing of credit

conditions between now and year-end, it may wish to consider the

following language for the second paragraph of the directive (alterna-

tive B):

To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of persisting

market-uncertainties; liquidity strains; and the forthcoming

Treasury financing the Committee seeks to promote SOMEWHAT GREATER

moderate growth in money and bank credit] over the months ahead,

WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF PERSISTING LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND allowing

for-a-possible BANK CREDIT GROWTH TO REFLECT A continued shift

of credit flows from market to banking channels. System open

market conditions consistent with that objective provided;[DEL:however,

(16) Encouragement of the more rapid growth in the money

supply indicated above would entail a more generous provision of non-

borrowed reserves by the System. As a result, net borrowed reserves

would likely move into a $500-$700 million range, member bank borrow-

ings drop to $650-$800 million, and the Federal funds rate might generally

be in a 6--6-1/2 per cent range. A relatively sharp drop in Treasury

bill rates, as well as other short-term rates, probably would accompany

such an easing in the money market, particularly if the Federal funds
the

rate moves down close to/discount rate and engenders expectations of a

discount rate reduction. It is not improbable that the 3-month Treasury

bill rate would drop below 6 per cent under those circumstances. How-

ever, Treasury net cash needs--at $6-$7 billion--are fairly large over

the balance of the year and would serve to restrain interest rate

declines.



-13-

(17) In the easier monetary environment envisaged, banks

would be likely to reduce offering rates on large CD's. Nevertheless,

with market rates reduced, total time deposits would be expected to grow

somewhat more rapidly than under alternative A. As a result of lower

domestic interest rates and strong inflows of funds, banks would probably

reduce Euro-dollar borrowings further, although whether individual banks

will permit such borrowings to fall below their reserve-free base is not

at all clear. Banks would also reduce their reliance on commercial paper

as a source of funds.

(18) The behavior of long-term interest rates would depend in

large part on expectational reactions in the market to the over-all easing

of monetary and credit conditions. It does not appear likely that a

gradual upward adjustment in the rate of money supply increase would

rekindle longer-run inflationary expectations, assuming the very modest

growth path of real GNP shown in the greenbook and assuming fiscal policy

does not become markedly more stimulative. Rather, the enhanced credit

availability accompanying the money growth could be accompanied by declining

bond yields over the short-run partly as corporate borrowers turn to bank

lines of credit in anticipation of lower long-term borrowing costs later

in the year. On balance, one might expect greater growth in money supply

in the second half of this year to be consistent with declining long-term

interest rates in corporate, municipal, and mortgage markets, although a

pick-up in the volume of security offerings in the latter two markets would

tend to act as a brake on the extent of rate decline.
