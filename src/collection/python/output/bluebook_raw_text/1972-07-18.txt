The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) The rate of growth in reserves available to support private

nonbank deposits has been fluctuating within the 4-1/2--8-1/2 per cent

annual rate range for June-July adopted at the last Committee meeting.

Estimates have been as low as 6 per cent, but most recent figures indicate

a rate of growth of 8-1/2 per cent for the period, as shown in Table 1

attached. Over the three statement weeks ending July 12, RPD has been

sustained by large excess reserves averaging $265 million, about $115

million more than expected.

(2) With private demand deposits coming in below expectations

in the latter part of June, M 1 expanded at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate

for the month, about one and a half percentage points below the rate built

into the alternative B path of the last Committee meeting. In the first

two statement weeks of July, however, there has apparently been a sharp

pick-up in the rate of expansion, and the level of M1 moved substantially

above the path levels specified earlier. It seems possible that the late

June weakness in narrowly defined money supply temporarily reflected in

some part either direct or indirect effects of large outflows of dollars

from the U. S.

(3) Growth of M2 from May to June--at a 10 per cent annual

rate--was close to earlier anticipations. Growth in time deposits other

July 14, 1972

than large CD's was the same as earlier projected. In early July, however,

such deposits are showing somewhat more strength than anticipated.

(4) The bank credit proxy in June expanded at a 4-1/2 per cent

annual rate, about as projected. The outstanding level of U. S. Government

deposits dropped sharply from May to June, although the average level of

such deposits in June turned out to be slightly higher than expected. In

recent weeks, the level of U. S. Government deposits has exceeded earlier

projections by substantially larger amounts, partly reflecting the sizable

volume of additional cash obtained by the Treasury through sale of special

securities to foreign central banks.

(5) Short-term interest rates, particularly rates on private

market instruments and the bank prime rate, have drifted upward since the

last Committee meeting. After reaching a recent peak of 4.14 per cent in

early July, the 3-month bill, however, was most recently quoted around 3.95

per cent, little changed from the time of the previous meeting. The Federal

funds rate has edged up from an area just under 4-1/2 per cent to around

4-5/8 per cent in the two statement weeks ending July 12. Meanwhile,

long-term interest rates have been generally stable.

(6) Recent tendencies for bill rates to decline have reflected

market anticipations of large demands for bills from foreign official

institutions acquiring dollars in support of foreign exchange rates.

Large foreign demands falling directly on the bill market have not yet

materialized, however. During the past statement week the Treasury put

on $670 million of specials, and the System sold $630 million of bills



-3-

directly to foreign account as technical factors, principally float,

provided considerably more reserves than anticipated or than needed to

meet reserve objectives. Foreign bill purchases in the market, coming

mainly on last Thursday and Friday, amounted to only $165 million. An

additional $2-3/4 billion of foreign buying is now in prospect for the

first three days of next week. Some of this may be invested in Treasury

specials; some may be accommodated through sales of bills from the

Exchange Stabilization Fund; and some may have to be purchased in the

market.

(7) The following table compares seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods with

the average annual rate of growth over the past two and a half years.

Prospective developments

(8) Patterns of monetary aggregates and money market conditions

summarized below (and detailed in tables on the two following pages) reflect

essentially the same alternatives presented to the FOMC at its last meeting.

For the third quarter as a whole growth rates in M1 and the Federal funds

rate range are identical, but there are some differences in other monetary

aggregates.

(9) Growth in M1 is expected to be considerably more rapid in

July than in June--around a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate--in view of the

apparent sharp rise of $5 billion in demand deposits in the first two weeks

of the month. The size of the increase--the largest two week increase in

1/ In addition, the level of M1 attained by September is lower than presented
at the previous meeting because rates of growth are linked to a June base
which fell somewhat short of levels estimated earlier.

the history of the series-probably reflects faulty weekly seasonal adjustments

and other temporary aberrations in a period containing a mid-year statement

date, a major holiday, and a somewhat larger than normal amount of Treasury

checks paid after the end of the fiscal year. We have projected a con-

siderable lowering in the average level of demand deposits in the latter part

of the month. A return to more normal conditions, and given the reserve

paths specified for the various alternatives, would lead to a more moderate

rate of M1 growth over the balance of the quarter.

(10) With respect to money and short-term market conditions,

the staff's best current estimate is that the Federal funds rate will need

to move up from the recent 4-1/2--4-5/8 per cent range--given rising trans-

action demands for cash associated with expansion in GNP--in attaining the

reserve path and aggregates of alternatives B or C, with a more pronounced

rise likely under alternative C. However, bill rates may not increase

much, and under some circumstances could decline, over the next few weeks.

The Government's near-term cash needs remain relatively small. Moreover,

the recent pattern of dollar outflows, if continued, will increase potential

foreign demand for bills. Between now and the next meeting of the Committee

a 3-month bill rate in a 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent range might be anticipated

under conditions of alternative B, assuming the funds rate in that

alternative does not move much, if any, above 4-3/4 per cent.

(11) The Treasury will announce on July 26 terms on which they will

refund $2.3 billion of publicly held obligations maturing in mid-August and

probably also $1.8 billion of September maturities. Because Treasury cash



-9-

has been buttressed by recent sales of special issues to foreign official

accounts, it is not clear that they would have to raise much, if any, new

cash at the time of the August refunding. While our staff estimates still

indicate a somewhat less comfortable position than do Treasury estimates, the

new cash that our estimates suggest will be needed by the end of August might

be obtained through further issuance of special securities to foreigners. In

the refunding, the Treasury might well choose to offer intermediate- and

longer-term securities in view of the relatively calm state of capital markets.

If the Treasury does emphasize such offerings, this would be likely to moderate

the usual seasonal upward pressures on short-term markets, particularly if

there is no sizable announced bill offering for cash.

(12) In the absence to date of substantial upward pressures on

short-term market rates, net inflows of time deposits other than large CD's

have remained relatively strong. It does appear from early figures for July

that the rate of expansion in the current month will drop somewhat from the

advanced June pace, but not by as much as we had earlier expected. Thus,

we have revised up our estimate of growth in such time deposits for the

third quarter, with the result that projections of M2 growth for that

quarter are somewhat stronger than at the time of the last meeting.

(13) Growth in the bank credit proxy is projected to remain

relatively low from June to July. Thereafter, the rate of expansion is

expected to accelerate as the outstanding level of U. S. Government deposits

rises. Sizable further sales of special issues to foreigners in the weeks

immediately ahead, however, could of course alter this projected pattern

of U. S. Government deposits and the credit proxy.



-10-

(14) Bank business loans, following what appears to be a

transitory drop in June, are expected to resume their rise in the months

ahead in view of the continued substantial increase projected for economic

activity, and for inventory accumulation in particular. If loan demands

strengthen as expected, and assuming bank sources of funds become more

costly and show only moderate growth (as is most likely under alternative C),

banks would probably become more reluctant buyers of longer-term issues of

securities. At the same time, demands for credit in bond markets are

expected to remain around recent levels over the next few months. Thus,

it would appear that bond markets will be under some upward interest rate

pressure unless there is a favorable shift in expectations. However, such

upward pressures may not develop over the weeks ahead if bill rates remain

around current levels. And over the longer run, the still wide spread of

long over short rates seems to permit scope for a rise in short rates

without significant effects on long markets.

(15) In the fourth quarter, assuming an M1 growth of around

6 per cent, short- and long-term interest rate increases are likely to be more

pronounced since Treasury cash borrowing is expected to rise much more

than seasonally at that time. Also, demand for money for transactions

purposes is likely to remain strong in the fourth quarter if growth in

nominal GNP accelerates somewhat further, as projected, from the current

10 per cent pace. On the other hand, aggregate money demand is likely

to be moderated to some degree by the lagged effects of interest rate

increases over recent months and in prospect.



-11-

Proposed directive

(16) Three alternative formulations for the operational

paragraph of the directive are presented below. They might be associated

with the correspondingly lettered patterns of growth in the aggregates

described in the preceding section.

(17) Alternative A.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: possible] THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments

in capital markets, and international developments, the Com-

mittee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-

ditions that will support [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT FASTER growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

(18) Alternative B.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: possible]

THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments in capital

markets, and international developments, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will

support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead."

(19) Alternative C.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: possible] THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments in

capital markets, and international developments, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that

will support [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates

over the months ahead."



-12-

(20) In all three alternatives it is proposed to retain the

instruction to take account of both capital market and international

developments (as well as Treasury financing) for essentially the same

purposes as they serve in the current directive. In particular, the

reference to international developments can be interpreted as calling

for minimizing downward pressures on bill rates to the extent consistent

with the specifications for reserves and monetary aggregates and the

Federal funds rate constraint desired by the Committee.
