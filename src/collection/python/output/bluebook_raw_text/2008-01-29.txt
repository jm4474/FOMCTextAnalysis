CLASS I FOMC – RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR) JANUARY 24, 2008 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Heightened concerns about credit losses and the global economic outlook 

together with the anticipation and subsequent realization of substantial near-term 

policy easing have dominated financial market developments since the December 

FOMC meeting.  Although pressures in short-term funding markets abated 

significantly after year-end, broader financial market conditions deteriorated sharply 

amid increased concerns about the economic outlook and additional write-downs of 

mortgage-related assets by large financial firms.  Even after the 75 basis point rate cut 

on January 22, market participants see substantial odds of at least 50 basis points of 

additional easing on January 30.  Moreover, the expected path of policy now bottoms 

out at around 2¼ percent in early 2009, about 90 basis points lower than at the time 

of the December meeting.  Shorter-term nominal Treasury yields fell in line with 

policy expectations; longer-dated Treasury yields also fell steeply.  Corporate bond 

spreads rose to their highest levels in about five years, with speculative-grade spreads 

jumping almost 130 basis points over the period since the December FOMC meeting.  

Broad equity price indexes dropped about 11 percent, on net, with financial stocks 

especially hard hit.  Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

reported tightening standards and terms over the past three months for a wide range 

of business and household loan categories; they also noted a broad softening of loan 

demand.  



   

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(2) The FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to lower the target federal 

funds rate by 25 basis points to 4¼ percent was largely anticipated by market 

participants.1  However, investors were surprised that policymakers did not 

simultaneously announce other measures to address strains in term funding markets.  

Near-term Eurodollar futures rates rose about 20 basis points, but Treasury coupon 

yields fell 10 to 20 basis points as investors’ concerns about the macroeconomic 

effects of funding market strains intensified.  These moves were largely reversed the 

next day, following the announcement of the establishment of the Term Auction 

Facility and reciprocal currency arrangements with two foreign central banks.  

Economic data—particularly the ISM and employment reports for December—came 

in softer than expected and prompted sharp reductions in money market futures rates.  

Although the release of the minutes of the December meeting elicited only a limited 

response in financial markets, interest rates moved down further in response to the 

Chairman’s January 10 speech and to speeches by other Federal Reserve officials that 

were read as suggesting that signs of broader economic weakness and additional 

financial strains would likely require an easier stance of policy.  Although investors 

had speculated about the possibility of an intermeeting move, the 75 basis point 

reduction in the target on January 22 came as a considerable surprise, and rates on 

money market futures contracts declined notably on the announcement.   On net, 

market participants now expect the funds rate to fall to around 2¼ percent by early 

2009 (Chart 1).  Judging from quotes on federal funds target binary options, investors 

place 34 percent odds on a quarter-point cut in the target at the upcoming FOMC 

meeting and 65 percent probability on a policy easing of 50 basis points or more.  As 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4.12 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
rate was again more volatile than usual.  The intraday standard deviation over the period 
averaged 27 basis points, significantly higher than was typical before August, and the 
interday standard deviation was likewise elevated.

of earlier this week, respondents to the Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers 

assigned around 60 percent probability to a 50 basis point rate cut, and most 

respondents anticipated no substantial changes from the January 22 statement.  On 

balance, market uncertainty about the course of monetary policy over the next year 

rose somewhat, and the negative skewness in option-implied distributions of the 

federal funds rate six months ahead seemed to have disappeared. 

(3) Consistent with the reduction in the federal funds rate target and 

expectations of additional substantial policy easing, yields on two-year nominal 

Treasury securities fell about 94 basis points, on net, and ten-year nominal Treasury 

yields declined about 46 basis points.  Yields on ten-year TIPS fell nearly as much as 

their nominal counterparts.  According to the staff’s term structure models, the 

substantial decline in TIPS yields since the December FOMC meeting owed roughly 

equally to lower expected real short rates, consistent with the downward revision to 

the outlook for the economy, and to a reduction in real term premiums.  TIPS-based 

inflation compensation at a five-year horizon moved roughly in line with oil prices 

and is now 12 basis points lower, on net, than at the time of the December meeting.  

Amid volatile trading conditions, five-year-forward inflation compensation five years 

ahead rose 23 basis points over the period since the December FOMC meeting, on 

balance, including a 10 basis point increase on the day of the rate cut on January 22.  

However, according to the desk’s survey of primary dealers, expected CPI inflation 

between five and ten years ahead increased only slightly from the December survey 

results, and the Michigan survey of households indicates that expected inflation over 

the next five to ten years edged down 10 basis points to 3 percent in January.  Term 

structure models as well as back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the rise in TIPS-

based inflation compensation owes to modestly higher inflation risk premiums rather 

than higher inflation expectations.

Money Markets 

(4) Conditions in short-term funding markets have improved notably since the 

December FOMC meeting.  Spreads of term federal fund rates and libor over 

comparable-maturity OIS rates narrowed somewhat following the announcement and 

subsequent implementation of the Term Auction Facility (See box “The Term 

Auction Facility and the Federal Funds Market”), and they fell considerably further 

after year-end.  Financial institutions’ evident ability to raise capital may also have had 

beneficial effects on bank funding markets.  Conditions in European interbank money 

markets also improved noticeably over the intermeeting period, as spreads on both 

overnight and term euro and sterling borrowing narrowed substantially.  In mid-

December, the European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, and 

Bank of Canada all announced special operations aimed at calming term money 

markets as part of a concerted effort with the Federal Reserve.  The European Central 

Bank and the Swiss National Bank auctioned $20 billion and $4 billion, respectively, 

of term funds they obtained in currency swaps with the Federal Reserve.  The 

European Central Bank also auctioned an unusually large amount of term funds in 

euros, while the Bank of England and Bank of Canada auctioned smaller amounts of 

funds in sterling and Canadian dollars, respectively.  Market participants reported that 

the coordinated central bank measures contributed to the improvement in money 

market conditions.  In the United States, spreads on asset-backed commercial paper 

over AA financial paper have dropped considerably from their very high levels in mid- 

to late December.  Spreads on lower-rated nonfinancial unsecured paper over AA 

nonfinancial paper have also fallen from their year-end highs but remain above the 

levels in late October when year-end pressures became apparent.  Asset-backed 

commercial paper outstanding increased during the first half of January, the first rise 

since last summer (Chart 2); the volume of unsecured paper was little changed over

The Term Auction Facility and the Federal Funds Market

In response to strains in term funding markets, the Federal Reserve established in December a 
Term Auction Facility (TAF)—a temporary program in which the Federal Reserve auctions 
funds for fixed terms of approximately one month to depository institutions that are judged to 
be in generally sound financial condition.  The TAF was established in coordination with the 
arrangement of swap lines to fund similar dollar liquidity facilities at other central banks.  
Judging from the first three auctions held in December and January, the TAF appears to have 
largely overcome the main drawback of the primary credit program: the perceived stigma 
associated with borrowing from the discount window.  All of the auctions were 
oversubscribed, with a substantial number of bidders, ample bid-to-cover ratios, and stop-out 
rates that were below prevailing term market rates.  Funds were awarded to a sizable and 
diverse group of depository institutions.  To maintain the overnight federal funds rate close to 
the target, the Desk offset the extra provision of reserve balances through the TAF and the 
swap lines with other central banks by redeeming $56 billion in Treasury bills and by reducing 
the level of long-term repurchase agreements outstanding by $9 billion. 

While it is not possible to isolate the impact of the TAF on financial markets from the effects 
of other recent market developments and the uneventful turn of the year, market participants 
attributed some of the narrowing in the spread between libor rates and overnight index swap 
rates of comparable maturities since mid-December to the TAF auctions and the 
accompanying auctions of term dollar funding from the European Central Bank and the Swiss 
National Bank.  The TAF may also have contributed to a reduction in volatility in the federal 
funds market, but, according to market commentary, the passing of the year end without 
serious disruption was likely at least as important to the stabilization in that market.  From the 
December FOMC meeting through the end of 2007, the intraday standard deviation of the 
funds rate was 40 basis points, on average; it has fallen to 13 basis points so far this year.  An 
important cause of the volatility in the funds rate late last year—a significant spread between 
rates paid by foreign banks over those paid by domestic banks and the associated tendency for 
the funds rate to be firm to the target in the morning and then soften after the close of 
business in Europe—has moderated significantly, perhaps in part because the TAF and other 
central bank auctions reduced foreign banks’ concern about their access to liquidity.

the entire period since the December FOMC meeting.  The outstanding amount of 

European asset-backed commercial paper continued to decline.  

Capital Markets 

(5) Broad-based U.S. equity price indexes were highly volatile and fell 11 

percent over the period since the December FOMC meeting in response to concerns 

about global economic outlook and substantial additional write-downs at large 

financial institutions.  Financial stocks notably underperformed the broad indexes, 

although declines were widespread across sectors.  The spread between the twelve-

month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run 

Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—widened further.  Option-

implied volatility on the S&P 500 index has moved higher on net since the December 

FOMC meeting, at times rising back to near its August peaks.  Yields on investment-

grade corporate bonds fell less than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities 

over the period since the last FOMC meeting, while yields on speculative-grade bonds 

rose markedly.  As a result, spreads of both investment- and speculative-grade bond 

yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields increased to their highest levels in 

about five years.  The sharp rise in speculative-grade spreads primarily reflects higher 

spreads in near-term forward rates, suggesting increased concerns on the part of 

investors about corporate credit quality over the next few years.  Gross bond issuance 

by nonfinancial firms was robust in December but has slowed this month.  The 

pipeline of leveraged loans awaiting syndication remains substantial, and secondary 

market bid prices for liquid leveraged loans declined further from levels already below 

those observed in early August.  An index of credit default swaps on leveraged 

syndicated loans (the LCDX) has risen about 90 basis points, on net, since the 

December FOMC meeting.  The ratio of municipal bond yields to those on Treasuries 

remains elevated, reflecting concerns about the strength of financial guarantors.  CDS 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 8 of 38



   

spreads on major financial guarantors have widened sharply since the December 

FOMC meeting, spurred by mounting worries about their exposure to subprime 

mortgage securities and fears about the possible effects of actual and potential 

downgrades by major rating agencies.  These spreads narrowed a good bit on January 

23 in response to a news article suggesting that New York insurance regulators are 

working on a plan to support financial guarantors, but remained very high. 

(6) Over the period since the December meeting, interest rates on thirty-year 

fixed-rate conforming mortgages and one-year adjustable-rate conforming loans fell 

63 and 51 basis points, to 5.48 and 4.99 percent, respectively.  Posted offer rates on 

thirty-year jumbo mortgages have also decreased since the December FOMC meeting, 

but the availability of such credit continued to be tight.  Issuance of residential 

mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) backed by nonconforming loans was extremely 

weak in the fourth quarter.  ABX spreads for all tranches continued to widen.  In 

contrast, issuance of agency MBS backed by conforming mortgages remained robust 

and spreads on such securities retreated further from their recent highs as year-end 

pressures eased.   

Market Functioning Outside of Money Markets 

(7) Trading conditions in a number of financial markets were strained at times.  

Liquidity in the market for Treasury coupon securities was somewhat impaired in 

December, amid concerns about year-end, and again in late January, reflecting flight-

to-quality flows.  Spreads between on- and off-the-run ten-year Treasury notes 

remained at multi-year highs throughout the period.  Bid-asked spreads on both on-

the-run and off-the-run Treasury notes had retreated to near-normal levels after year-

end, but they rose again on January 22 and remain elevated, on net.  Treasury bill 

yields initially rose after the turn of the year, as market participants reported 

significantly improved trading conditions; however, more recently, renewed safe-

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 9 of 38



   

haven flows pushed three-month Treasury bill yields 68 basis points lower, on net.  

Similarly, overnight general collateral repo rate continued to trade well below the 

overnight federal funds rate for most of the period since the December FOMC 

meeting.  Lending from the SOMA securities portfolio reached record levels in 

December, led by strong demand for Treasury collateral ahead of year-end, and were 

again elevated in late January.  Several measures of liquidity in corporate markets 

showed signs of deterioration before the turn of the year—trading volumes declined 

significantly, a proxy for bid-asked spreads on corporate bonds widened, and trades 

appeared to have a larger-than-normal impact on prices—but these trends largely 

reversed in January.  Bid-asked spreads for leveraged syndicated loans have widened a 

good bit since December and are now a few basis points above the peaks reached in 

August.  Judging from the abnormally wide range of quotes submitted by various 

dealers for the same reference entities, liquidity and price discovery remain impaired 

in CDS markets.  The FX swap market also shows signs of improvement, although 

trading conditions remained somewhat strained. 

Foreign Developments 

(8) Foreign financial markets were unsettled over the period since the 

December FOMC meeting, reflecting growing concerns about further financial 

distress and global spillovers from slower U.S. growth.  Late in the period, broad 

equity price indexes in major foreign equity markets dropped sharply.  Stock prices 

rebounded somewhat following the FOMC’s announcement on January 22 of the 75 

basis point cut in its federal funds target, but equity markets have remained jittery.  

Stock prices in many emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern 

Europe—which previously had not been much affected by the turmoil in other 

markets—experienced severe declines over this period.  Since the December FOMC 

meeting, foreign stock prices have fallen on net by amounts that range from 10 to 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 10 of 38



   

nearly 20 percent, with financial stocks leading the way down (Chart 3).  Yields on 

long-term government securities in major foreign industrial countries declined 15 to 

25 basis points, reflecting lower policy expectations, and CDS and EMBI+ spreads on 

emerging market sovereign debt widened noticeably, as investors attempted to reduce 

risk.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies 

has moved down ¾ percent on balance since the December FOMC meeting.2  The 

dollar depreciated more than 4½ percent against the yen and nearly as much against 

the Swiss franc, driven in part by the unwinding of carry-trade positions by 

increasingly risk-shy investors.  The dollar declined slightly on balance against an 

index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  On January 22, the Bank 

of Canada cut its policy rate 25 basis points, citing lower Canadian inflation and a 

weaker outlook for the U.S. economy.   

Debt and Money 

(9) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have expanded at 

an annual rate of 7¼ percent in the fourth quarter of last year, almost 2 percentage 

points less than in the previous quarter (Chart 4).  Growth of nonfinancial business 

debt decelerated in the fourth quarter from its rapid third-quarter pace, as growth in 

C&I loans slowed and despite robust bond issuance.  The limited data on financing 

activity since year-end suggest that business borrowing has slowed further this month.  

In the household sector, home mortgage debt is projected to have decelerated further 

in the fourth quarter, reflecting the weakness in home prices, declining home sales, 

and tighter credit conditions for some borrowers.  Consumer credit continued to 

expand at a moderate pace last quarter.  Banks indicated on the most recent Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey that they had tightened standards and terms on many 

                                           
2   There were no foreign official purchases or sales of dollars by reporting central banks in 
industrial countries during the intermeeting period.

types of household and business loans and that they expected a further deterioration 

in loan quality in 2008.  

(10) M2 grew 6 percent at an annual rate in December, boosted primarily by 

flows to the relative safety and liquidity of retail money funds.3  Growth in small time 

deposits edged down but remained elevated, as several thrift institutions offered 

attractive deposit rates to secure funding.  A deceleration in liquid deposits amid 

subdued economic activity in the fourth quarter as well as a sizable contraction in 

currency partially offset the expansion of other components of M2.

Economic Outlook  

(11) The staff has marked down substantially its projection for aggregate 

demand relative to aggregate supply since the December Greenbook, in response to  

a sharp drop in equity prices, tighter conditions in some credit markets, and 

surprisingly weak indicators of real activity.  As a consequence, the staff forecast takes 

on board the 75 basis point reduction on January 22 and assumes another 50 basis 

point cut at this meeting; from that point on, the funds rate is assumed to remain 

steady at 3 percent through the end of 2009.  Longer-term Treasury yields are 

projected to edge up as investors’ expectations about the path of monetary policy—

which currently embed further easing in coming months—gradually converge to the 

staff’s assumption.  Stock prices are assumed to climb at an annual rate of 13 percent 

over the next two years, as the equity premium declines toward more normal levels  

in response to the gradual waning of macroeconomic risks.  The real foreign exchange 

value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate about 2½ percent annually in 2008 and 

2009.  The price of crude oil is little revised from the December Greenbook, and still 

is expected to decline gradually.  The staff forecast assumes that the adoption of  

a fiscal stimulus package—comprising individual income tax rebates and a bonus 

depreciation allowance for investment in 2008—will boost growth this year but 

subtract from it next year, leaving the level of GDP at the end of 2009 only a bit 

higher than in the absence of the assumed fiscal package.  Nonetheless, with a leveling 

off of residential investment and a gradual easing of credit conditions, the pace of real 

GDP growth is projected to pick up from about 1½ percent this year to around  

2¼ percent in 2009.  The unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually, reaching 

5¼ percent in 2009, about ½ percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the 

NAIRU.  Both the level and the growth rate of potential output, in history and going 

forward, have been revised upward since December, causing the output gap to show 

more slack than in December.  While recent monthly readings on inflation have been 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 15 of 38



   

elevated, the public’s expectations of future inflation appear to have remained 

reasonably well contained.  With oil prices assumed to edge down and slack in labor 

and product markets rising, total PCE inflation is projected to decline from  

2¼ percent in 2008 to about 1¾ percent in 2009, and core PCE inflation edges down 

from just above 2 percent this year to just below 2 percent next year. 

(12) The staff’s forecast has been extended beyond 2009 using the FRB/US 

model with adjustments to ensure consistency with the staff’s assessment of  

longer-run trends.  The extended forecast embeds several key assumptions:  Monetary 

policy aims to stabilize core PCE inflation, in the long run, at a level of 1¾ percent 

(the midpoint of the range of FOMC participants’ October projections for the rate of 

inflation in 2010); trend multifactor productivity growth slows gradually towards  

an annual rate of 1 percent; the real price of energy remains approximately flat;  

the real value of the dollar depreciates steadily at about 1¼ percent per year; and fiscal 

policy is essentially neutral.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, 

with the federal funds rate staying at 3 percent through 2010, before moving back up 

into the neighborhood of 4 percent.  As a result, the unemployment rate gradually 

declines to 4¾ percent—the staff’s assessment of the NAIRU—by 2012, while PCE 

inflation converges to 1¾ percent.  The real federal funds rate increases from about  

1 percent in 2008 to about 2¼ percent by the end of 2012.  

Monetary Policy Strategies 

(13) As indicated in Chart 5, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run 

r*—the value that would close the output gap over the next twelve quarters—now 

stands at 0.8 percent, 1½ percentage points lower than in the December Bluebook 

and about 60 basis points below the current value of the real federal funds rate.   

The downward revision reflects the drop in equity prices, the tightening of credit 

markets, and the receipt of weaker-than-expected economic data since early

December, as well as the staff’s reassessment of the supply-side dimensions of  

the forecast.  Such factors, most importantly the decline in equity prices since  

the December Greenbook, also induced sharp declines in the estimates of short-run 

r* obtained from the small structural model and the FRB/US model.  These two 

estimates are now virtually identical to the Greenbook-consistent measure.  In 

contrast, the estimate obtained from the single equation model has been marked 

down much less—from 2½ percent to about 2¼ percent—because this measure 

depends on current and lagged values of the output gap but not on financial 

conditions or other leading indicators of aggregate demand. 

(14) Chart 6 depicts FRB/US optimal control simulations in which policymakers 

place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal, on 

keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in  

the nominal federal funds rate.4  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set 

of charts), the optimal control simulation prescribes a nominal federal funds rate that 

declines slowly to near 3 percent over the next three years or so and then rises 

modestly to about 3½ percent by 2012.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-

hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate falls more sharply to below 2½ percent by 

the end of next year before rising to about 4 percent by 2012.  Under either inflation 

goal, these prescriptions are substantially lower than those shown in the December 

Bluebook, largely reflecting the weaker outlook for aggregate demand relative to 

aggregate supply in the current forecast.  The unemployment rates over the next 

several years are noticeably higher than in the previous Bluebook.  The trajectories for 

core inflation for this year are above those shown in December but roughly 

unchanged thereafter.  
                                           
4 In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to have a distaste for changing the current-
quarter federal funds rate from its previous-quarter level; this inertia is the primary reason 
why the optimal policy path under either inflation goal prescribes a rate that remains above  
4 percent in the current quarter—close to its 2007Q4 average of 4.5 percent—and declines 
only gradually over subsequent quarters.

(15) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule (the left 

panel) prescribes a funds rate path that declines to 3¼ percent in 2010; on average,  

this trajectory is more than a percentage point lower than in the December Bluebook. 

Financial market participants anticipate an even steeper downward slope to the path 

of policy in coming quarters, with the funds rate declining to 2 percent by the end  

of this year; indeed, forward contracts indicate that the funds rate is now expected  

to remain below 4 percent through the end of 2012 (the right panel).  The confidence 

intervals obtained from stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model and from 

options on interest rate caps each indicate a significant probability that the funds rate 

falls below 2 percent within the next few quarters and is below 2 percent through  

the end of 2012.  The near-term prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher 

than in December because of recent elevated readings on core inflation, while those 

from the Taylor (1999) rule are more sensitive to aggregate demand and hence 

somewhat lower than in the previous Bluebook.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(16) This Bluebook presents four policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  The text shown in red indicates the changes 

from the January 22 statement, which appears along with the December 11  

statement on the page following the table.  Alternative A cuts the federal funds  

rate target by 75 basis points to 2¾ percent, Alternative B cuts the target 50 basis 

points to 3 percent, Alternative C cuts the target 25 basis points to 3¼ percent,  

and Alternative D leaves the target unchanged at 3½ percent.  For each of the four 

alternatives, the rationale paragraph refers to considerable stress in financial markets, 

tightening of credit conditions, and the deepening of the housing contraction;  

the three easing alternatives also mention the recent softening in labor markets.   

Each alternative states that policymakers expect inflation to moderate this year  

while emphasizing the need for careful monitoring of inflation developments.   

All four alternatives note that the current stance of policy should help promote 

moderate growth over time; Alternatives A and B also indicate that these policy 

actions should help mitigate the risks to economic activity.  Alternative A states  

that downside risks “may well remain” and that incoming information will determine 

“whether further action is needed to address those risks.”  Alternative B states  

that “downside risks to growth remain” whereas Alternatives C and D reiterate the  

January 22 assessment that “appreciable” downside risks remain; all three of these 

alternatives indicate—as in the January 22 statement—that policymakers “will act  

in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”  As usual, the Committee could 

formulate its statement using language from more than one alternative. 

(17) If incoming information in recent weeks has led policymakers to mark 

down their assessment of the modal outlook for aggregate demand relative to 

aggregate supply by an amount similar to that of the staff, then the Committee may 

prefer to reduce the target funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting, as in

Rationale 

3.  The Committee expects inflation to 
moderate in coming quarters, 
reflecting well-anchored inflation 
expectations, a projected leveling out 
of energy prices, and easing pressures 
on resource utilization.  However, 
further increases in energy and 
commodity prices, as well as other 
factors, could put upward pressure on 
inflation.  Therefore, it will be 
necessary to continue to monitor 
inflation developments carefully.

4.  Today’s policy action, combined 
with those taken earlier, should help to 
promote moderate growth over time 
and to mitigate the risks to economic

effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects 
to determine whether further action is 
needed to address those risks.

January 22, 2008 Statement 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent.  

2.  The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and 
increasing downside risks to growth.  While strains in short-term funding markets 
have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued to 
deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households.  
Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as 
well as some softening in labor markets. 

3.  The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be 
necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. 

4.  Appreciable downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will continue to assess 
the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in 
a timely manner as needed to address those risks.  

December 11, 2007 Statement 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent. 

2.  Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the 
intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer 
spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks.  
Today’s action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote 
moderate growth over time.  

3.  Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and 
commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation.  In this 
context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to 
monitor inflation developments carefully. 

4.  Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have 
increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation.  
The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments 
on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable 
economic growth.

Alternative B.  The staff forecast’s assumes that the funds rate is cut to 3 percent  

at this meeting and then maintained at that rate through 2009; with that stance of 

policy, the unemployment rate remains about ½ percentage point above the staff’s 

estimate of the NAIRU while core inflation edges just below 2 percent at the end of 

next year.  Members might consider this combination of outcomes to be about the 

best feasible under current circumstances, reflecting the extent to which recent data 

have pointed towards a noticeable worsening of the short-run tradeoff between 

economic activity and inflation.  Even if Committee members are somewhat more 

optimistic than the staff regarding the modal outlook for economic activity, they may 

view this policy action as appropriate for mitigating the downside risks to growth  

that were emphasized in the January 22 FOMC statement.  Indeed, since investors’ 

uncertainty about the economic outlook is apparently contributing to elevated credit 

spreads and dampened consumer and business spending, a substantial easing move  

at this meeting could bolster confidence that policymakers will act as needed to foster 

sustained growth and reduce the likelihood of adverse macroeconomic developments 

such as the Greenbook’s “Recession” scenario.  However, policymakers may prefer  

at this stage not to take out further insurance by easing more than 50 basis points, 

given the possibility that such a move could induce an upward shift in the distribution 

of inflation outcomes over coming quarters, as illustrated by the “Gradual Reversal” 

scenario in the box on “Risk Management Strategies.”  Nonetheless, by explicitly 

noting that downside risks remain, the Committee would suggest the possibility that 

substantial further easing could be needed in response to incoming information. 

(18) The statement under Alternative B largely reiterates the rationale portion  

of the January 22 statement, including references to “considerable stress” in financial 

markets, tightening of credit conditions, deepening of the housing contraction, and 

some softening of labor markets, as well as restating the Committee’s assessment of 

the prospects for inflation.  The final paragraph of the statement indicates that

Risk Management Strategies

Simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks  
 for monetary policy.  However, such rules are generally  
 specified in terms of the modal forecast and hence  
 abstract from risk management considerations.  In this  
 box, we gauge the benefits and costs of alternative  
 policy strategies using the version of the FRB/US model
 in which expectations of the private sector are formed  
 based on past economic data.  As a point of reference, 
suppose that the Greenbook outlook is the best feasible  
under current circumstances, at least in the absence of  uncertainty. 

Now consider the “Recession” scenario presented in  
 the Greenbook alternative simulations.  When monetary 
 policy is determined by the Bluebook’s Outcome-Based  
 Rule (dotted lines), the federal funds rate declines  
 gradually in response to incoming data, reaching a trough 
 of about ¾ percent in late 2009 before returning to the 
 Greenbook baseline a few years later.  With this policy, 
 the unemployment rate rises a bit above 6 percent next 
 year and takes about five years to return to the NAIRU, 
 while core PCE inflation falls well below the assumed  
long-run inflation goal of 1¾ percent.   

If policymakers could instantly be sure that such a  
 recession was already in train, they might well cut the  
 funds rate target immediately to a rate below 1 percent 
in order to reduce the severity of the downturn.  In reality, 
 of course, economic turning points are notoriously difficult 
 to predict or even to identify contemporaneously.  Thus, 
 policymakers might prefer to take out some insurance by 
 easing the stance of policy even before the onset of 
 recession was fully evident.   

 Such an approach is illustrated by the Risk Management  
path (solid lines), in which the funds rate target is   
reduced to 1½ percent for two quarters and thereafter  
follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.    This policy has visible effects in stabilizing economic  
 activity and inflation:  The unemployment rate at the peak 
 of the recession is about ¼ percentage point lower than 
 in the absence of insurance, and the inflation rate stays 
 noticeably closer to the assumed long-run inflation goal  
 of 1¾ percent.

It is also important to gauge the costs that would be  
incurred in following such a risk management strategy  
if in fact no recession occurs.  For this purpose, suppose 
that economic conditions unfold as in the Greenbook 
baseline (dotted lines) but that policymakers have  
taken out some insurance against the risk of recession  
by lowering the target funds rate to 1½ percent for  
two quarters. 

In the Prompt Reversal case (solid lines), the strength  
of economic activity is assumed to be recognized  
quickly and the policy insurance is then removed;  
indeed, policy is tightened somewhat further to offset  
the effects of the initial policy stimulus, and thereafter 
follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.   
In this case, the funds rate target rises almost a percentage 
point above the Greenbook baseline path by the end  
of this year.  With this policy path, core inflation  
remains very close to the Greenbook baseline while  
the unemployment rate only deviates temporarily. 

In contrast, in the case of Gradual Reversal (dashed lines), 
the strength of economic activity is assumed to become 
evident only over a longer period, and hence the policy  
insurance is removed over the course of a year rather  
than in a single quarter; that is, after the first two  
quarters, the funds rate is adjusted according to the  
empirical outcome-based rule, which responds only 
gradually to incoming data.  This path of policy  
generates persistent deviations of unemployment and 
inflation from the Greenbook baseline; even at the end  
of 2012, core inflation remains nearly a quarter point  
above the assumed long-run inflation goal of 1¾ percent.

this policy action, combined with those taken earlier, “should help to promote 

moderate growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity” but notes  

that “downside risks to growth remain” and emphasizes—as in the January 22 

statement—that the Committee “will act in a timely manner as needed to address 

those risks.”   

(19) Alternative B would likely be seen by market participants as broadly 

consistent with their current expectations for the funds rate, because a 50 basis point 

easing of the target funds rate at this meeting appears to be their modal expectation 

and because the risk assessment would probably be read as indicating a substantial 

probability of further easing.  Since investors assign most of the remaining probability 

to a smaller easing, the adoption of this alternative might cause a modest decrease in 

interest rates, a rally in equity prices, and perhaps some depreciation of the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar.     

(20) If policymakers would prefer to move more aggressively to promote growth 

and mitigate downside risks, then they might choose to reduce the funds rate target  

by 75 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Even after the funds rate cut 

on January 22, the real federal funds rate exceeds the Greenbook-consistent estimate 

of short-run r* by about 60 basis points; thus, this degree of easing would be desirable 

if policymakers share the staff’s outlook but would prefer to bring the unemployment 

rate back to the NAIRU more quickly than in that outlook, an approach that might 

leave inflation close to 2 percent at the end of the decade.  Following the January 22 

move with another aggressive easing at this meeting might also be attractive from a 

risk management point of view—that is, Committee members may see benefits in 

moving more than they would perceive as needed merely to offset the weakening in 

the modal outlook.  With the housing contraction steepening and financial stresses 

continuing to intensify, policymakers may be particularly concerned about reducing 

the likelihood of a nonlinear feedback cycle in which deteriorating macroeconomic 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 28 of 38



   

conditions generate further strains in financial markets and augment pressures on 

banks’ balance sheets, further constricting the supply of credit and hence leading to a 

fairly deep and long-lasting recession.  This policy approach might be particularly 

appealing if members anticipated that the Committee would be equally flexible and 

decisive in reversing the course of policy once downside risks to growth start to 

wane—as in the “Prompt Reversal” scenario in the box on “Risk Management 

Strategies”—or upside risks to inflation start to loom larger.  Members might also  

be attracted to this alternative if they believe that a larger easing move at this meeting 

would diminish the probability that another rate cut would be needed over the 

subsequent intermeeting period. 

(21) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative A is identical to that of 

Alternative B, but this alternative elaborates further about the prospects for inflation, 

pointing out that the projected moderation of inflation reflects “well-anchored  

inflation expectations, a projected leveling out of energy prices, and easing pressures 

on resource utilization,” and noting that “further increases in energy and commodity 

prices, as well as other factors, could put upward pressure on inflation.”  Of course, 

the Committee could choose simply to repeat the inflation rationale given in the 

January 22 statement.  As in Alternative B, the risk assessment states that the stance  

of policy should help promote moderate growth and mitigate the downside risks to 

economic activity.  In light of the stronger policy action, however, this alternative  

is somewhat less definitive regarding the magnitude of downside risks to growth, 

indicating that such risks “may well remain” and that the Committee will assess 

incoming information to determine “whether further action is needed to address 

those risks.”   

(22) Although market participants appear to see only about one-tenth odds  

that the funds rate target will be reduced by 75 basis points at this meeting, the risk 

assessment in this alternative would likely be read as indicating a somewhat lower 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 29 of 38



   

probability of further easing over the next few months.  Thus, this policy action might 

be viewed largely as a timing surprise, especially since futures contracts indicate that 

investors expect the funds rate to decline to about 2¾ percent by the March FOMC 

meeting.  Consequently, the impact on Treasury coupon yields could be rather limited.  

Of course, this policy move might bolster market confidence and help alleviate 

perceptions of tail risks to the macroeconomy, causing equity prices to rise and credit 

spreads on corporate debt to narrow.  However, this alternative could also heighten 

concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook, in which case forward inflation 

compensation might rise noticeably further and the foreign exchange value of the 

dollar could depreciate. 

(23) If members are concerned that the stance of policy remains somewhat 

restrictive but would prefer a more incremental approach in responding to incoming 

information, then the Committee could choose to reduce the funds rate target by  

25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C.  This alternative might be  

viewed as most consistent with the typical pattern of gradual funds rate adjustment  

in response to changes in resource utilization and core inflation.  Such gradualism 

reflects the usual pace of incoming information regarding the appropriate policy 

stance and reduces the odds of sudden reversals in the path of policy.  Members  

may also be concerned that more substantial policy accommodation could spark  

an increase in longer-term inflation expectations, as in the Greenbook’s “Unanchored 

Inflation Expectations” scenario.  Moreover, given the challenges in monitoring 

underlying inflation expectations, such a development might not become apparent 

very quickly and could then be quite costly to reverse.  

(24) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative C is identical to that of 

Alternatives A and B, but this alternative notes that upward pressure on inflation 

could result from “further increases in energy, commodity, and other import prices.”  

Moreover, in contrast to those two alternatives, the risk assessment in Alternative C 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 30 of 38



   

makes no reference to mitigating the risks to economic activity.  The remainder of  

the risk assessment paragraph for this alternative is the same as in the January 22 

FOMC statement, reiterating that “appreciable downside risks to growth remain”  

and that the Committee “will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”    

(25) Market participants would be somewhat surprised by a 25 basis point 

reduction in the target federal funds rate at this meeting, because the Desk’s survey 

and market data suggest that market participants are placing only about one-third 

odds on a 25 basis point easing, with virtually all of the remaining probability  

assigned to larger moves of 50 or 75 basis points.  To be sure, the reference in the  

risk assessment to acting in a “timely manner” may be read as pointing to a possible 

intermeeting easing of policy.  But, given the smaller-than-anticipated policy action  

at this meeting, financial markets might well conclude that further easing moves 

would be incremental.  Thus, Alternative C would probably induce a rise in short-

term interest rates; however, intermediate-term yields might rise less or perhaps even 

decline if investors concluded that a sluggish near-term pace of policy adjustment 

implied that even more easing would be needed down the road.  Equity prices would 

likely fall while credit spreads on corporate debt would widen.  At the same time,  

five-to-ten-year forward TIPS-based inflation compensation might retrace some of  

its recent increase, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could appreciate a bit.  

Moreover, given the highly skittish attitudes of investors and relatively illiquid trading 

conditions in some markets, policy surprises might well generate unusually large 

reactions in financial markets. 

(26) In view of policy actions to date, policymakers might prefer to wait  

for additional economic and financial information before taking any further policy  

action, as in Alternative D.  Some policymakers may judge that the current softness 

in the economy is likely to be transitory and that ongoing financial developments are 

likely to have less effect on aggregate demand than anticipated by the staff and other 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 31 of 38



   

forecasters.  In addition, monetary policy has already been eased considerably, and 

significant fiscal stimulus seems likely to be enacted, perhaps reducing the need for 

further monetary accommodation.  Moreover, policymakers might be concerned 

about the extent to which recent elevated levels of inflation and forward inflation 

compensation might be pointing to a higher trajectory of prices going forward.   

This approach might also be appealing to policymakers who prefer a more distinct 

downward tilt of the trajectory for inflation over the next few years than in the staff 

forecast, as in the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 1½ percent.  

(27) The statement under Alternative D reiterates several elements of the 

rationale portion of the January 22 statement—including references to considerable 

stress in financial markets, tightened credit conditions, and deepening of the  

housing contraction—but does not cite recent developments in labor markets.  

Because this alternative leaves the stance of policy unchanged, the statement simply 

indicates that “recent policy actions should promote moderate growth over time.”   

This alternative reaffirms the Committee’s expectation that inflation will moderate  

in coming quarters, but adds the same explanation as in Alternative C regarding  

the factors that could put upward pressure on inflation.  Moreover, with no change  

in policy and few economic data releases on the calendar between January 22  

and January 30, the assessment of risks in Alternative D is identical to that of  

the January 22 statement.  

(28) Alternative D could surprise and confuse market participants, who  

are virtually certain that the funds rate target will be cut at least 25 basis points  

at this meeting.  The absence of any policy action would be particularly difficult to 

understand in light of the January 22 FOMC statement, which noted “appreciable 

downside risks to growth” and emphasized that the Committee “will act in a timely 

manner as needed to address those risks.”  While shorter-term interest rates  

would rise noticeably, investors would probably become more concerned about the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 32 of 38



   

economic outlook, leading to a further drop in longer-term Treasury yields, a marked 

widening of credit spreads on corporate debt, and sharp declines in equity prices. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(29) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is expected to grow at about a  

5¼ percent rate in the current quarter, about a quarter point faster than the growth 

rate forecasted in December.  This pace would significantly exceed the 3¼ percent 

forecast for nominal GDP growth this quarter.  The decline in velocity reflects  

the boost to money demand from the sharp decline in the opportunity cost resulting 

from monetary policy easing as well as the unusually strong flows into money market 

mutual funds that have likely been prompted by the financial turmoil.  For 2008  

as a whole, M2 is forecast to expand at a 6 percent annual rate, considerably above  

the 3¾ percent expansion projected for nominal GDP.  With opportunity cost 

leveling off later this year and financial markets presumably becoming less volatile,  

M2 is projected to expand at a 4¼ percent rate in 2009, in line with growth in  

nominal GDP.  

(30) After advancing at an estimated 8¼ percent pace in 2007, domestic 

nonfinancial sector debt is projected to slow to a 5 percent rate this year and to 

moderate further to an average rate of 4¾ percent in 2009.  The deceleration reflects  

a broad-based slowdown in borrowing by households, nonfinancial businesses, and 

state and local governments.  Household debt is projected to increase only modestly 

over the forecast period, restrained by the dampening effects on mortgage borrowing 

of falling house prices and weak home sales.  In addition, sluggish gains in household 

spending on durable goods and tighter standards and terms on consumer loans are 

expected to weigh on growth in consumer credit.  Business borrowing is expected to 

slow sharply as M&A and share repurchase activity abates significantly.  The 

expansion of debt in the state and local government sector is also projected to

decelerate considerably, reflecting an anticipated drop in issuance for both long-term 

capital projects and advance refundings.  The difficulties of major bond insurers are 

expected to restrain municipal bond issuance somewhat in 2008.   By contrast, the 

growth of federal debt is expected to pick up in 2008, boosted in part by borrowing to

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( yt − *yt  and y *t t+1| − t 1|ty + ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (Δ −4 y *t t+3| Δ t 3

4 y + |t ), and π *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( y y *t t− )  – 2.72( y y *t t−1 1− − )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( y y *t t+1| − t t+1| )–1.37( y y *t t−1 − − )]1
Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt –π * ) + 0.5( y y *t t− )

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –π * ) + 0.5(Δ −4 4y *t t+3| Δ t+3|t ) y
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
