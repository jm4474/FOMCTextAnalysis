CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

SEPTEMBER 17, 2009 



 

 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

SUMMARY 

Financial market conditions continued to become more supportive of 

economic activity over the intermeeting period.  Despite economic data that 

appeared to be about in line with expectations, Treasury yields declined over 

the period as statements by policy makers were seen as consistent with a flatter 

path for interest rates and term premiums apparently fell.  Risk spreads 

narrowed a bit further, and equity prices rose, on net, over the period.  On 

balance, conditions in short-term funding markets showed some additional 

signs of improvement, and borrowing from Federal Reserve facilities declined 

further over the intermeeting period.  In contrast, bank credit remained very 

weak, with the runoff particularly notable for business loans.  Moreover, 

spreads on commercial and industrial loan rates increased further to a very high 

level.   

Financial market conditions abroad also improved over the intermeeting 

period.  Equity prices increased in most advanced foreign economies and 

emerging markets, although they decreased in Japan and China.  With several 

foreign central banks underscoring their commitments to keep interest rates 

low for an extended period, yields on sovereign debt generally fell.  The dollar 

depreciated against most major currencies. 

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

The Committee’s statement following the August FOMC meeting was 

broadly in line with market expectations, and subsequent price action was 

muted, with both nominal and real Treasury yields edging down.  Market

1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.15 percent over the intermeeting period.  
Trading volumes were roughly constant throughout the period, and the intraday 
standard deviation averaged 4 basis points.  Market participants speculated recently 
that the impending decline in the Treasury’s supplementary financing account and 
the resulting increase in reserve balances may put some downward pressure on the 
effective federal funds rate.  

participants reportedly took particular note of the reiteration of the “extended 

period” language, of the indication that “economic activity is leveling out,” and 

of the decision to gradually slow the pace of Treasury securities purchases.  

Investors also noted the continued discussion of reserve management tools 

that could be employed in the context of a withdrawal of policy 

accommodation.  The release of the minutes on September 2 also generated 

little market reaction, although mention of the Committee’s discussion about 

the possible tapering of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 

purchases garnered attention, as did comments indicating that the economy 

would likely recover only slowly in the second half of the year. 1 

Futures quotes combined with the staff’s standard assumptions about term 

premiums imply that policy expectations for the second half of 2010 and for 

2011 shifted down about 30 to 55 basis points over the intermeeting period 

(Chart 1).  Futures rates now suggest that investors do not expect the first 

increase in the federal funds target rate until the second quarter of 2010, slightly 

later than at the time of the last FOMC meeting and closer to expectations 

obtained from survey data.  Indeed, the Desk’s September dealer survey results 

indicated that all but 3 of the 17 respondents expect the first target rate increase 

to occur during or after the third quarter of 2010.  This prediction was 

essentially unchanged from the August survey; the lack of change – along with 

a decline in policy uncertainty measured from implied volatility from options

on interest rate futures – suggests that at least part of the decline in the policy 

path owed to lower term premiums, which are not captured in staff models. 

Nominal Treasury yields declined, on net, across the curve over the 

intermeeting period.  Against the backdrop of weak economic activity and a 

benign outlook for inflation, investors may have simply concluded that a lower 

path of interest rates would be more consistent with the likely pace of 

economic recovery.  As with shorter-term rates, however, some of the decline 

in longer-term yields may have reflected lower term premiums.   

Yields on five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities fell more than 

their nominal counterparts, leaving five-year inflation compensation 20 basis 

points higher, while five-year inflation compensation five years ahead declined 

by roughly 35 basis points.  The reduction in forward inflation compensation 

unwound some of the run-up in this measure over the preceding intermeeting 

period.  Staff models indicate that recent fluctuations in this measure mainly 

reflect changes in liquidity and inflation risk premiums rather than changes in 

inflation expectations.  Readings on long-term inflation expectations from 

surveys were about flat over the period. 

Auctions of $254 billion in Treasury coupon securities across the term 

structure were conducted during the intermeeting period.  Most auctions were 

well received, with stop-out rates close to or lower than when-issued rates just 

prior to the auctions and bid-cover ratios near or above average.  Indirect 

bidding participation continued to be strong, led by demand from foreign 

accounts and investment funds.

2 On September 9, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking presenting an 
option for extending the Debt Guarantee Program (DGP), a component of the 
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  Under the option, the DGP would expire 
as indicated in the current regulation; however, the FDIC would establish a limited 
six-month emergency guarantee facility under which the FDIC would guarantee 
senior unsecured debt issued on or before April 30, 2010.  Market participants 
reportedly noted that use of the emergency guarantee facility would likely be very 
limited as the high participation cost and stringent application requirements would 
attach significant stigma to its use. 
 

CAPITAL MARKETS 

Broad equity indexes rose about 6 to 10 percent, on net (Chart 2).  Implied 

volatility as measured by the VIX ended the period a bit lower.  The equity risk 

premium – measured by the staff’s estimate of the expected real equity return 

over the next ten years relative to the real ten-year Treasury yield – edged down 

over the period, but remains elevated. 

Developments regarding banks were mixed over the period.  While equity 

prices for large banks rose 10 percent, stock prices for regional and smaller 

banks were about unchanged.  Market participants reportedly continue to be 

concerned about smaller institutions’ exposure to the commercial real estate 

sector.  In addition, 21 depository institutions failed over the intermeeting 

period, likely contributing further to the reduction in investor confidence in 

smaller banks.  Meanwhile, CDS spreads for banks were about unchanged on 

balance over the period.  Despite the fact that spreads on nonguaranteed senior 

unsecured debt increased somewhat over the period, issuance continued in 

August at roughly the rate posted in July.  While none of the debt issued in 

August carried an FDIC guarantee, so far in September, one firm, Citigroup, 

has issued $5 billion in FDIC-guaranteed debt.2

In the broader corporate bond market, risk spreads edged down further 

over the period.  While indexes of investment-grade corporate CDS spreads 

ended the period little changed on balance, those of speculative-grade CDS 

spreads narrowed appreciably.  Municipal bond yields declined, on net, 

resulting in very little change in the ratio of municipal bond yields to those on 

comparable-maturity Treasury securities.   

The new-issue market for commercial mortgage-backed securities remained 

closed as conditions in the commercial real estate sector continued to be quite 

weak.  Commercial property prices fell further in the second quarter, reaching a 

level about one-third below their peak in 2007.  Delinquencies on commercial 

mortgages held by banks continued to rise in the second quarter, and the 

delinquency rate on securitized commercial mortgages remained near its 

historical high in July.  Commercial real estate sales ticked up in August but 

remained well below historical norms.  Indexes of CDS spreads on AAA 

tranches of commercial mortgages were little changed on net, over the 

intermeeting period. 

Interest rates on 30-year conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages 

retraced a portion of the increase recorded in the late spring and ended the 

intermeeting period at about 5 percent, down roughly 20 basis points over the 

intermeeting period.  Yields on agency MBS also trended down in line with the 

yields on Treasury securities.  Reflecting the lower interest rates on mortgages 

early this spring, issuance of MBS by the housing-related GSEs remained very 

strong in July.   

In the consumer sector, spreads on AAA-rated consumer-loan asset-backed 

securities (ABS) have now retraced almost entirely the run-up seen over the

past year.  Delinquencies on consumer loans remained elevated, and charge-

offs on such loans at commercial banks increased further in the second quarter.  

Gross issuance of consumer-loan ABS proceeded at a pace well above that 

recorded earlier in the year, and issuance (at least in some sectors) appeared to 

be somewhat less reliant on Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 

(TALF) financing.  Despite the improved conditions in ABS markets, overall 

consumer credit registered a noteworthy decline in July, contracting at a 10½ 

percent annual rate, after falling at a 6½ pace in the second quarter. 

MARKET FUNCTIONING 

Functioning and liquidity improved modestly or held steady in most 

financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Spreads between Libor and 

overnight index swaps (OIS) at the three- and six-month maturities narrowed 

somewhat further; however, tiering in the interbank market reportedly 

remained substantial (Chart 3).  Bid-asked spreads and haircuts for most types 

of repurchase agreements were little changed, and no bids were submitted at 

either of the Term Securities Lending Facility auctions during the period.  

Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated asset-backed 

commercial paper fluctuated near the bottom of the ranges established since 

the beginning of the crisis.  Average fitting errors in staff yield curve models for 

nominal Treasury issues were little changed, but those for TIPS securities 

declined further.  Trading volume for Treasury securities was little changed, but 

remained relatively low.   

Some improvements in functioning and liquidity were also evident in the 

corporate bond market.  The median estimated bid-asked spreads for both 

speculative- and investment-grade bonds edged lower, and the average range of 

CDS dealer contributions narrowed a bit further.  However, the basis between

the CDX investment-grade index of CDS spreads and investment-grade 

corporate bond spreads – a rough gauge of possible arbitrage opportunities in 

corporate debt markets – was little changed at a level that remains somewhat 

high by historical standards.   

Total Federal Reserve assets increased about $135 billion over the 

intermeeting period as increased holdings of securities outpaced declines in 

credit supplied through liquidity and credit facilities.  (See box entitled “Balance 

Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period.)  Reflecting further 

improvements in market conditions, the Federal Reserve announced that the 

amount offered at the September Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions would 

be reduced another $25 billion to $75 billion.  For the two auctions that took 

place over the intermeeting period, propositions continued to fall short of the 

amounts offered, and the auctions stopped out at their minimum bid rates.  

The TALF was the only facility to register an increase over the period.  The 

$6.5 billion in loans issued under the September 3 TALF operation supported 

roughly $16.8 billion in ABS issuance; this ratio is the lowest ratio of TALF 

support to issuance to date.  The low ratio partly reflects the narrowing of ABS 

spreads.  In addition, a large proportion of the deals were backed by prime auto 

loans, which have tended to rely less on TALF financing. 

BANK CREDIT, DEBT, AND MONEY 

Total assets at commercial banks decreased at an average annual rate of 

almost 12 percent in July and August, as declines in bank credit more than 

offset a significant increase in cash assets that owed to higher levels of reserves.  

Indeed, bank credit continued to contract rapidly in August, declining at nearly 

an 11 percent annual rate.  As in July, all major loan components decreased.  

Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans dropped at a 28 percent annual pace 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 73



Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period 

Since the August FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve’s total assets edged up 
to about $2.1 trillion.1  As a result of ongoing asset purchases, securities held 
outright increased by $191 billion, which more than offset the $60 billion decline in 
lending through liquidity and credit facilities.   

The Open Market Desk purchased $34 billion in Treasury securities, $15 billion 
in agency debt securities, and $142 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) during the intermeeting period.2,3  In contrast, most of the System’s other 
liquidity and credit programs contracted further, reportedly due to improvements in 
global bank funding markets and market participants’ desire to reduce their reliance 
on government sponsored programs for funding.  Term auction credit declined $38 
billion, foreign central bank liquidity swaps declined $14 billion, and primary credit 
declined $5 billion.  Lending under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility remained at 
zero, and securities lent through the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)—
which do not affect on-balance-sheet assets because the Federal Reserve retains 
ownership of the securities lent—fell to zero. 

Use of facilities supporting money funds and the commercial paper market also 
declined as a result of improvements in market conditions.  Credit extended by the 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) decreased $15 billion.  Loans made 
under the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity 
Facility (AMLF) fell by $35 million to $79 million.  Term Asset-Backed Securities 
Loan Facility (TALF) loans increased $14 billion over the intermeeting period.  
Roughly $7 billion of this increase represents loans extended under the TALF 
operation conducted on August 6, 2009 and settled on August 13, 2009.  The two 
TALF operations conducted during the intermeeting period were also of relatively 
modest size.  The first loan subscription, totaling $2.1 billion, funded legacy 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  The second loan subscription, 
totaling $6.5 billion, financed issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by 
auto, credit card, student, small business, and mortgage-servicing-advance loans.   

                                                            
1 These data are through September 16, 2009. 
2 The figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the 
Open Market Desk committed to purchase, but has not settled, an additional $113 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 On August 17, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that it reduced the number of external 
investment managers for the agency mortgage-backed securities purchase program from four to two; one 
investment manager provides trade execution and the other provides analysis.  The first settlement with one 
external investment manager went smoothly.  On September 1, the Open Market Desk began to accept on-
the-run agency debt securities for purchase in order to mitigate market dislocations and promote overall 
market functioning.  

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 73



On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account decreased $30 billion.  The Treasury’s supplementary financing 
account remained unchanged at $200 billion, but the Treasury announced its 
intention to reduce supplementary financing balances over the next several weeks 
to preserve flexibility in conducting debt-management policy as outstanding debt 
approaches the federal debt ceiling.  Reserve balances of depository institutions 
increased $101 billion over the intermeeting period.

(Chart 4).  Market commentary suggests bank loan demand remained weak in 

part because proceeds from a portion of high-yield bond issuance were used to 

repay leveraged loans.  In addition, according to the results of the Survey of 

Terms of Business Lending conducted in August, the weighted-average spread 

of C&I loan rates over comparable-maturity market rates increased further.  

However, the average spread on loans to the subset of lower-risk borrowers 

edged down.  The contraction in commercial real estate lending intensified last 

month, with large decreases posted by both large and small domestic banks.  

Some large banks reported substantial originations of residential mortgages, but 

that development was more than offset by increased sales of such loans to the 

GSEs, resulting in a 15 percent annualized decrease in on-balance-sheet 

holdings in August.  Home equity and consumer loans also continued to fall.  

Consistent with the recent runoff in total assets, banks shed managed liabilities 

again in August. 

Debt of the private domestic nonfinancial sector is estimated to have run 

off at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the second quarter, as the levels of both 

household and nonfinancial business debt fell.  Household mortgage debt 

declined at an annual rate of about 1½ percent in the second quarter while 

nonmortgage consumer credit shrank at an annual rate of 6½ percent.  On net, 

nonfinancial debt financing likely stepped down again in August, as sizable 

issuance of nonfinancial bonds was more than offset by the decrease in C&I 

lending.  Net issuance of commercial paper was about flat as firms apparently 

continued to substitute toward longer-term financing.  Federal government 

debt growth remained elevated, while state and local government borrowing 

picked up with the improved conditions in the municipal bond market.

Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have increased at 

an annual rate of 4¾ percent in the second quarter, up from 4 percent in the 

first quarter.  In the third quarter, domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to 

expand at annual rate of 4 percent, with household and nonfinancial business 

debt contracting further and government borrowing remaining rapid. 

The contraction in M2 steepened in August.  (See box “Why Is Money 

Growth So Weak?”)  The expansion in liquid deposits slowed further, and 

runoffs in small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds 

accelerated, likely in part a result of investors’ increased appetite for riskier 

assets as the economy shows signs of recovery.  Currency expanded in recent 

months at much slower rates than in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first 

quarter of 2009.  Staff estimates suggest this deceleration caused by a 

moderation in foreign demand for U.S. banknotes coupled with solid domestic 

demand.  The monetary base increased at about a 9 percent annual rate on 

balance over July and August as Federal Reserve asset purchases more than 

offset declining usage of most Federal Reserve liquidity and credit facilities.   

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 

The trade-weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the 

major foreign currencies has declined 2½ percent since August 10.  Most of 

this depreciation occurred recently and may be attributable in part to investors’ 

reduced perceptions of risk.  In contrast, the exchange value of the dollar 

against the currencies of our other important trading partners has increased 

slightly over the period, as the dollar has appreciated 2½ percent against the 

Mexican peso.  This appreciation came after the Bank of Mexico signaled that it 

would scale back its foreign exchange intervention.

Why Is Money Growth So Weak?  

M2 grew at a tepid pace in the second quarter of this year and contracted 
appreciably over July and August. Steep declines in small time deposits and retail 
money market mutual funds (MMMFs) accounted for the contraction; liquid 
deposits and currency, while still growing moderately, also decelerated from their 
earlier pace.  As shown in the figure, this recent behavior follows robust money 
growth late last year and early in 2009 (the solid line).  In general, the recent 
weakness (and prior strength) of M2 growth cannot be explained by a model based 
on the historical relationships of M2 with nominal income and opportunity costs 
(model predictions portrayed by the dashed line).  Instead, two factors appear to 
account for the recent low growth.  First, declining bank credit and revised rules 
regarding deposit insurance premiums have likely led banks to bid less aggressively 
for deposits than they had in the past.1  Second, with financial markets healing, the 
appetite for risk among investors evidently recovering, and returns on M2 assets 
quite low, households are apparently reallocating their wealth away from the 
relative safety and liquidity of M2 assets.    

 

                                                            
1 As of the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC began including brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of an 
institution’s domestic deposits in the metrics used to price an institution’s deposit insurance.

2 Funds swept from noninterest-bearing transaction accounts to noninterest-bearing savings accounts are also 
covered by the TLGP. 

                                                           

As shown in Table 1, the expansion in liquid deposits, the largest component 
of M2, picked up late last year amid the turmoil in financial markets.  Growth 
remained robust through the second quarter of 2009 as the FDIC’s Temporary 
Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which provides unlimited insurance on non-
interest-bearing transaction accounts at participating banks, likely made such 
deposits especially attractive to depositors during the crisis.2  Small time deposits 
also surged in late 2008, as some depository institutions bid aggressively for these 
funds amid strained conditions in wholesale funding markets.  Later, as conditions 
in funding markets began to improve, and as banks began to shrink their balance 
sheets, rates offered on these deposits fell and small time deposits began to 
contract.  Similarly, as MMMF rates hovered near zero, balances at such funds ran 
off sharply.  Thus, the shift away from M2 assets is likely being boosted by the 
exceptionally low rates paid on M2 deposits.  Notably, the outflows from M2 have 
coincided with robust flows into long-term mutual funds, especially bond funds.   

The recent decline in M2 deposits is consistent with commercial banks’ 
reduced funding needs.  Loans on banks’ books have contracted steeply this year in 
response to weak loan demand and tight lending standards and terms, and banks’ 
securities holdings have expanded only modestly.  As a result, banks have pared 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 73



their managed liabilities considerably over the course of the year, and M2 deposits 
at banks have edged back, on average, since mid-year.

Headline stock indexes in Europe increased about 9 percent, which market 

participants partly attributed to upbeat economic data releases, but the Japanese 

stock market was down about 3 percent.  CDS spreads on emerging market 

sovereign debt declined moderately, and equity prices in most major emerging 

market economies rose.  One exception is China’s A-shares, which declined 

about 6 percent.  Part of this decline was associated with media reports that 

authorities were taking actions to moderate the pace of loan growth in China.   

Despite the release of upbeat economic indicators, expected policy rates 

over the next two years and sovereign yields declined in most major industrial 

economies (Chart 5).  Market participants attributed part of these movements 

to major central banks emphasizing their commitments to keeping interest rates 

low.  The European Central Bank left its main policy rate unchanged at 1 

percent, as expected, but surprised markets by announcing that it will offer 

banks twelve-month funds at only 1 percent at its upcoming long-term 

refinancing operation.  The Bank of England (BoE) released its quarterly 

Inflation Report, which market participants interpreted as more pessimistic 

than had been expected on the outlook for recovery.  In connection with the 

release, Governor King expressed concern that the remuneration of all reserves 

at Bank Rate, introduced along with its quantitative easing program in March, 

created a disincentive for banks to turn those reserves into other assets.  Some 

market participants expect the BoE to revert to a framework in which reserves 

exceeding a particular level are remunerated at a penalty.

3 The current Greenbook includes projections for 2011 in the medium-term outlook 
and 2014 in the long-term outlook for the first time. 

4 Purchases of $300 billion in Treasury securities are assumed to be completed by the 
end of October; $150 billion in agency debt and $1.25 trillion in agency MBS are 
projected to be finished by the end of the first quarter of 2010.   

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

Information received since the August meeting provides further evidence 

that economic activity has begun to recover from its severe downturn.  The 

staff has revised up its forecast based on the accumulation of better-than-

expected data on economic activity.  With the sharp decline in residential 

investment apparently over and business spending on equipment and software 

likely to recover sooner than previously anticipated, the staff now anticipates 

that real GDP growth will increasingly exceed the growth of potential output 

over the second half of this year and through 2011.3  As a consequence, the 

unemployment rate is projected to decline steadily in 2010 and 2011, although 

it remains nearly 8 percent at the end of the forecast period.  Core and headline 

PCE inflation are projected to slow, reaching 1 percent in 2011.   

As in August, the staff outlook assumes that the federal funds rate will 

remain at its current level through 2011.  The staff has made no change in its 

assumptions about the sizes of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase 

(LSAP) programs.  However, agency debt and agency MBS purchases are 

assumed to be completed a quarter later than in the August Greenbook.4  The 

staff continues to anticipate that fiscal policy will contribute about 1 percentage 

point, on average, to real GDP growth in 2009 and 2010, but will be roughly 

neutral in 2011.  In response to favorable news on the housing market in recent 

months, the staff now projects markedly less house price depreciation through 

next year than in the August Greenbook, and a slight appreciation in 2011.  

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 73



 

 

The staff projects longer-term Treasury yields and 30-year fixed mortgage rates 

to edge up through 2011, with little change in the spread between the two rates.  

In contrast, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds are projected to 

decline substantially, as improvements in financial markets and the economic 

outlook lead to a ¾ percentage point narrowing in risk spreads by the end of 

2011.  Similarly, the equity risk premium is expected to continue to decline over 

coming quarters and stock prices are projected to rise at a brisk annual rate of 

about 14 percent over the next two years.  The availability of bank credit to 

firms and households is expected to increase over time but remain tight by 

historical standards.  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed 

to fall at a 2½ percent annual rate over 2010 and 2011.  Based on readings from 

futures markets, the staff expects oil prices to rise gradually to about $77 per 

barrel for West Texas Intermediate by the end of 2011; this path is about $5 

per barrel lower than in the August Greenbook. 

Against this backdrop, the staff now expects real GDP to grow at an 

annual rate of about 2¾ percent during the second half of 2009, compared 

with 1¼ percent in the August Greenbook, and to expand about 3½ percent in 

2010 and about 4½ percent in 2011.  The unemployment rate is projected to 

peak at nearly 10 percent late this year and then to decline to about 9¼ percent 

by the end of 2010, which is about ½ percentage point lower than in the 

August Greenbook.  Unemployment is projected to decline further over 2011 

to slightly under 8 percent—still well above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU, 

which has been revised up to 5¼ percent over the forecast horizon.  In light of 

the current and prospective level of economic slack, as well as inflation 

expectations that are expected to remain reasonably well anchored, the staff 

projects core PCE inflation to slow to 1¼ percent in the second half of this 

year and to about 1 percent in 2010 and 2011.  With energy prices rising at a 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 73



 

 

 

diminishing rate, total PCE inflation is projected to be about 2 percent in the 

second half of 2009, 1¼ percent in 2010, and 1 percent in 2011. 

Looking further ahead, the staff assumes that the funds rate will rise 

steadily starting in early 2012, climbing to about 2½ percent by the end of that 

year and to 3¾ percent in 2013, before leveling out at 4 percent in 2014.  The 

staff forecasts that real GDP will grow nearly 5 percent in 2012 but then 

decelerate to about 2¾ percent by 2014.  With GDP growth outpacing growth 

in potential output, which is forecast to average about 2¾ percent per year over 

this period, the unemployment rate is projected to fall rapidly for a time before 

stabilizing at about 4¾ percent, close to the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU in 

2014.  Inflation expectations remain well anchored and as growth returns to 

trend, total PCE inflation slowly rises to about 1¾ percent by 2014, still below 

the inflation objectives implicit in the majority of policymakers’ longer-run 

projections.

5 If the previous version of the FRB/US model is used, the Greenbook-consistent r* 
measure for the current Bluebook is -2.2 percent.  This means that 50 basis points 
of the rise in r* are due to the improved outlook and 30 basis points are due to 
changes in the in the FRB/US model.  The Greenbook-consistent r* measure using 
the prior vintage of the EDO model is -3.3 percent, implying that 170 basis points 
of the rise in the EDO-based r* come from the better outlook and 20 basis points 
from changes in the EDO model. 

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

As shown in Chart 6, estimates of r*—the value of the real federal funds 

rate that would close the output gap within twelve quarters—have risen 

substantially since the August Bluebook.  Though all the estimates of short-run 

r* remain negative, they are no longer uniformly well below the actual real 

federal funds rate.  The different r* estimates have increased for various 

reasons, but all were substantially boosted by the effects of stronger-than-

expected incoming economic data on the staff assessment of the current level 

of aggregate demand, and its implications for future slack in the various 

models.  The Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run r* from the 

FRB/US and EDO models stand at -1.9 and -3.1 percent, respectively, while 

the FRB/US and EDO model-based estimates of short-run r* are -2.4 and -0.3 

percent, respectively.  The changes in the FRB/US and EDO r* estimates 

largely reflect the improved economic outlook implied by incoming data but 

they also have been affected by the respecification and reestimation of the 

models that followed the comprehensive NIPA revision in July.5  The estimate 

of short-run r* produced by the single-equation model is now -1.3 percent, 

about 100 basis points higher than in the August Bluebook, while the r*

6 The single-equation and small structural models have not changed since the August 
Bluebook.  

7 In the current projection, the staff estimate of the NAIRU is 5¼ percent, a 25 basis 
point increase over the previous Greenbook estimate.  

estimate based on the small structural model is -1.1 percent, about 200 basis 

points higher than in the previous Bluebook.6  

Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US 

model.  These simulations use the extended staff forecast as a starting point.  

Policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation 

close to a 2 percent inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the 

NAIRU, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  As in recent 

Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy under these simulations is constrained by 

the zero lower bound, with the nominal funds rate remaining at the lower 

bound until early 2012 (black solid lines).  The unemployment rate at the end 

of 2011 is well above the NAIRU, and core PCE inflation is appreciably below 

the 2 percent goal.7 

Chart 7 also displays the optimal control results that would be obtained if 

the nominal funds rate were not constrained by the zero bound (blue dashed 

lines).  Under this unconstrained policy, the funds rate falls to about -4¾ 

percent by late next year and does not turn positive until 2012.  The 

unconstrained funds rate in 2010 and 2011, although negative, is consistently 

more than 100 basis points above that shown in the August Bluebook, 

reflecting the staff’s stronger forecast of aggregate demand.  The improved 

economic outlook and the reestimation of the FRB/US model imply an 

appreciably faster decline in the unemployment rate than in the previous

8 Real economic activity is considerably more sensitive to interest rate movements in 
the reestimated version of FRB/US model than in the previous version.  The model 
revision thus contributes to a faster decline in the unemployment rate in the optimal 
control simulations. 

Bluebook, while the unconstrained optimal path for core PCE inflation in 2010 

and 2011 is broadly similar to that shown in the previous Bluebook.8   

Also consistent with the improved outlook, the outcome-based policy rule 

prescribes a higher path for the federal funds rate than in the August Bluebook, 

as shown in Chart 8, with the rate starting to move above the effective lower 

bound in 2011Q4, one quarter earlier than in August.  In contrast, based on the 

staff’s standard assumption about term premiums, market participants’ 

expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the next few 

years appear to have shifted down by about 50 basis points.  However, as noted 

earlier, at least part of the apparent decline in investors’ expectations may 

reflect a decline in term premiums.  

The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple 

policy rules.  For the constrained rules, the current prescriptions are uniformly 

at the effective lower bound, except for the prescription from the first-

difference rule.  The first-difference rule prescribes that the funds rate be raised 

when there is an increase in expected output growth.  The rule therefore calls 

for an increase in the funds rate as the recovery gains strength.  The right-hand 

columns show the prescriptions that would be implied by these rules if the 

lower bound was not imposed.  While the first-difference rule prescribes a 

positive interest rate, the remaining rules’ unconstrained prescriptions are for 

negative policy rates.  In every case, however, these prescribed values are less 

negative than in the previous Bluebook, consistent with the staff’s improved 

assessment of the outlook.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for 

the Committee’s consideration.  Table 1 gives an overview of key elements of 

these alternatives; draft statements are provided on the subsequent pages. 

Each of the three alternatives maintains the 0 to ¼ percent target range for 

the federal funds rate and the previously announced plan to purchase $300 

billion of Treasury securities by the end of October, but the alternatives differ 

with respect to the size and timing of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency 

MBS and agency debt.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would increase its 

purchases of agency MBS to “a total of $1.5 trillion” (from the previous “up to 

$1.25 trillion”) and would extend the time over which purchases would be 

completed through the second quarter of 2010.  The increase would provide 

additional macroeconomic stimulus, while the extension would permit the pace 

of transactions to be tapered until completion to promote a smooth transition 

in markets (although this tapering is not explicitly noted in the statement).  

Language about the amounts and timing of agency debt purchases (up to $200 

billion by the end of the year) would be as in the August statement.  Alternative 

B would essentially maintain the current stance of monetary policy but specify a 

tapering strategy for the purchases of agency MBS and agency debt: The pace 

would gradually slow, with purchases completed either by the end of the first 

quarter of 2010 or, in a variant of this alternative, by sometime in the second 

quarter of 2010.  In recognition of the pending completion of Treasury security 

purchases and the gradual scaling down of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity 

programs, Alternative B notes that the Federal Reserve will use “a range of 

tools” rather than “all available tools” to promote economic recovery and 

preserve price stability.  Under Alternative C, the size of agency MBS purchases 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 31 of 73



 

 

would be reduced to “about $1 trillion” and that of agency debt to “about $150 

billion,” from their previously announced maximums, and the pace of 

purchases would be gradually reduced until their completion by year-end.  

Alternative C also makes more explicit the conditionality of the funds rate 

target on the evolution of the economic outlook by changing the language that 

characterizes the period over which the target range is likely to remain 

extraordinarily low.  

Each alternative provides a distinct characterization of the economic 

outlook.  Alternative A states that economic activity “is leveling out” but notes 

that the economic recovery could be relatively weak.  Alternatives B and C are 

progressively more optimistic, with Alternative B saying that economic activity 

has “picked up following its severe downturn” and Alternative C stating 

explicitly that the data suggest a “recovery in economic activity has begun.”  All 

three alternatives acknowledge some further improvement in financial market 

conditions.  Alternatives B and C note increased activity in the housing sector.  

As in the August statement, all three alternatives reiterate the Committee’s 

expectation that inflation “will remain subdued for some time.”  To explain this 

view, Alternatives A and B note that “substantial resource slack [is] likely to 

continue to dampen cost pressures,” while Alternatives B and C state that 

“inflation expectations [are] apparently well anchored.”  Alternative A also 

notes that “inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.”

August FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests 
that economic activity is leveling out.  Conditions in financial markets have improved 
further in recent weeks.  Household spending has continued to show signs of 
stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, 
lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed 
investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into 
better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a 
time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial 
markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will 
contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of 
price stability. 

The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial 
resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that 
inflation will remain subdued for some time. 

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate 
that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced, to provide support to 
mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private 
credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of 
agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end 
of the year.  In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion 
of Treasury securities.  To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases 
of Treasury securities are completed, the Committee has decided to gradually slow 
the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased 
by the end of October.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and 
overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic 
outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the 
size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and 
liquidity programs as warranted.

September FOMC Statement – Alternative A  

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in 
August indicates that economic activity is leveling out, and conditions in 
financial markets have improved somewhat further.  Businesses have made 
progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  
However, household spending is sluggish, job losses are ongoing, and 
credit remains tight.  Although the Committee continues to anticipate a 
resumption of economic growth in a context of price stability, absent 
further policy action the economic recovery could be relatively weak, 
with slack in resource utilization diminishing quite slowly. 

2. Inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.  With substantial 
resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures, the Committee 
expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. 

3. To promote a sustained economic recovery and higher resource 
utilization, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary 
stimulus by increasing its purchases of agency mortgage-backed 
securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously announced 
amount of as much as $1.25 trillion, and to extend these purchases 
through the second quarter of 2010.  As previously announced, the 
Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities 
by the end of October and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the 
year.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate 
at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low levels of resource 
utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Committee will 
continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of 
securities, in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in 
financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and 
composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and 
liquidity programs as warranted.

September FOMC Statement – Alternative B 

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in 
August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe 
downturn.  Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and 
activity in the housing sector has increased.  Household spending seems 
to be stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish 
income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still 
cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they 
continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment 
with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the 
Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and 
institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a 
strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels 
of resource utilization in a context of price stability. 

2. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures 
and with inflation expectations apparently well anchored, the Committee 
expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. 

3. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a range 
of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The 
Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ 
percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended 
period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to 
improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will

and up to $200 billion of agency debt.  The Committee will gradually slow 
the pace of its purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in 
markets and anticipates that they will be completed [by the end of the 
first quarter | in the second quarter] of 2010.  As previously announced, 
the Federal Reserve’s purchases of $300 billion of Treasury securities will be 
completed by the end of October 2009.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light 
of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The 
Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet 
and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

September FOMC Statement – Alternative C  

4. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in 
August suggests that a recovery in economic activity has begun.  
Conditions in financial markets have improved further.  Consumer spending 
seems to be stabilizing but has yet to show sustained strength.  Activity 
in the housing sector has increased.  Businesses are still cutting back on 
fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to 
make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  
The Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets 
and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support 
a strengthening of economic growth in a context of price stability. 

5. With inflation expectations apparently well anchored, the Committee 
expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.  

6. In view of improving economic and financial market conditions, the 
Committee now plans to purchase a total of about $1 trillion of agency 
mortgage-backed securities and about $150 billion of agency debt, 
somewhat less than the previously announced maximum amounts.  To 
promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee will gradually 
slow the pace of its purchases until their expected completion by the end 
of the year.  As previously announced, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of 
$300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October.  
The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance 
sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as 
warranted.  So long as inflation remains well contained, the Committee 
will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its exceptionally 
low level of 0 to ¼ percent until it has greater assurance that the 
economic recovery will be sustained.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of 
the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 

If policymakers believe that the policy stimulus already in train is likely to foster 

the most satisfactory economic outcomes feasible given current economic 

circumstances, the Committee could reaffirm its forward guidance regarding the funds 

rate and continue implementing its previously announced large-scale asset purchases 

(LSAPs), while providing additional information regarding the winding-down process, 

as in Alternative B.  Maintaining the current stance of monetary policy might be 

appealing if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic and 

financial news is consistent with inflation remaining subdued and economic growth 

picking up to an acceptable pace in coming quarters as financial market conditions 

and the housing sector continue to improve.  While the staff’s forecast has been 

revised up, projected employment growth remains modest, with the level of private 

payroll employment at the end of 2011 still about 1 million below its pre-recession 

peak, suggesting that a very accommodative stance of monetary policy remains 

appropriate.  Although the improved outlook has led to sizable increases in the 

Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run r* since August, these measures are still 

negative.  The anticipation that the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally 

low “for an extended period” remains consistent with the funds rate path implied by 

the estimated outcome-based rule, despite the upward shift in this path since the 

August Bluebook (Chart 8).   

Even if some participants now foresee a more rapid resumption of economic 

growth and a stronger recovery than in the Greenbook (similar to the Greenbook’s 

“V-Shaped Recovery” alternative scenario), they may prefer to wait for more 

definitive signs of this stronger recovery before modifying their policy stance, given 

the uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook and the approaching expiration 

of some government programs that have been supporting growth.  Even under the 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 38 of 73

Debt LSAPs.” 

more robust conditions of this scenario, the Taylor rule does not prescribe a policy 

tightening until early 2011. 

Alternatively, policymakers may view the prospective economic recovery with its 

protracted return to full employment as less than satisfactory, but they may believe 

that the potential benefits of providing further monetary stimulus through expanded 

LSAPs are likely to be outweighed by the potential costs.  These costs include 

potential losses on the Federal Reserve’s portfolio under scenarios involving a sharp 

increase in short-term interest rates over the next few years, the possibility that an 

expanded balance sheet could lead to higher inflation expectations, and the increased 

complications that a larger balance sheet could entail for the Committee’s exit 

strategy. 

The Committee may find it desirable to slow the pace of its agency MBS and 

agency debt transactions so that these purchases taper off instead of ending abruptly, 

thereby minimizing the risk of financial market disruptions.9  This approach would be 

consistent with the gradual slowing of the pace of Treasury purchases announced in 

August and with market expectations that the Federal Reserve will adopt a similar 

strategy for the agency debt and agency MBS programs (as indicated by responses to 

the Desk’s survey of primary dealers).  Implementing the slowing without changing 

the total maximum amount to be purchased would necessitate extending the time 

over which the purchases would be completed.  Alternative B suggests two possible 

end dates for the purchases:  the end of the first quarter or sometime in the second 

quarter of 2010. 

To the extent that the primary influence of the programs is through the 

cumulative effect that they generate on the publicly available stocks of securities 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 73



 

 

rather than through the pace of new purchases, the choice between these end dates 

would probably make little difference to the macroeconomic effect of the asset 

purchases.  But the desire to taper purchases as they end is predicated on the belief 

that the pace of asset purchases affects asset prices to some degree, even if stock 

effects dominate.  Extending the timeframe would allow for a more gradual tapering, 

thereby helping to alleviate market participants’ concerns that there could be an 

abrupt price reaction upon the Fed’s exiting the market.  The Committee might also 

consider the longer extension desirable because it would allow for more flexibility in 

the path of future purchases, so that the total amounts purchased could be better 

calibrated to changes in the economic outlook.  For example, the Committee might 

value the optionality in a strategy that initially involved appreciably smaller weekly 

purchases than at present.  Such a strategy would provide more opportunities for the 

Committee to evaluate, based on the evolution of the economic outlook, whether to 

end purchases before the maximum levels are reached or to raise the level of 

purchases.  However, the cost of greater optionality for the Committee is that it 

entails less certainty for market participants.  In addition, the longer extension means 

a reduced flow of purchases, given no change in the total amount purchased.  

Policymakers who view the flow of purchases as having a significant macroeconomic 

impact may see the reduced flows entailed in the longer extension as a cost.  

A statement such as that suggested for Alternative B would be close to market 

expectations and would likely have muted effects in financial markets.  The Desk’s 

survey of primary dealers indicates that they uniformly expect no change in the funds 

rate target or in the maximum sizes of the LSAPs.  Nearly all the dealers said they 

expect the Federal Reserve to adopt a tapering strategy for agency debt and agency 

MBS, with the median survey respondent anticipating completion by the end of the 

first quarter of 2010.  Accordingly, if the Committee chooses to extend its purchases 

through the first quarter of next year, there would likely be little immediate change in 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 40 of 73



 

 

short- and long-term yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  

Extending purchases into the second quarter of 2010 might put some upward 

pressure on long-term yields in the near term to the extent that flow effects are 

important and also to the extent that market participants view the reduced pace of 

sales over a longer period as signaling higher odds that the Committee will ultimately 

choose to purchase smaller quantities than currently anticipated.  However, at least to 

some degree, extending purchases into the second quarter would mean lower long-

term yields during that period than otherwise.  Also, market participants may perceive 

the revision in language from the Federal Reserve’s using “all available tools” to “a 

range of tools” as indicating less chance of future increases in the LSAPs, but 

currently, investors appear to be putting little weight on an expansion.

If policymakers view the incoming data as pointing to more underlying 

momentum in the nascent recovery than they previously anticipated and are at least as 

optimistic as the staff regarding the economic outlook, they might choose to trim the 

size of the LSAPs and to adjust the language regarding the anticipated period over 

which the funds rate is likely to remain extraordinarily low, as in Alternative C.  

Under this alternative, the Committee would announce lower amounts of planned 

purchases of agency MBS and agency debt compared with the current maximum 

amounts and would revise the stated expectation for a very low federal funds rate.  

Instead of “for an extended period,” the statement would say: “So long as inflation 

remains well contained, the Committee will maintain the target range for the federal 

funds rate at its exceptionally low level of 0 to ¼ percent until it has greater assurance 

that the economic recovery will be sustained.”  The revised language has the benefit 

of being more explicit that the stance of monetary policy will depend on the evolution 

of the economic outlook, which may prove useful as a first step in preparing the 

public and the markets for an eventual increase in the federal funds rate target.  The

change in language would likely be seen by market participants as pointing to an 

earlier end to the period of extraordinarily low funds rates than is implied by the 

Committee’s recent statements.  

Participants might prefer Alternative C if they viewed the continued improvement 

in financial market conditions and the significant upward revision in the staff forecast 

as suggesting that less monetary policy support from the Federal Reserve is required 

and, given the improvement in the housing sector, that a reduction in the maximum 

amount of purchases of mortgage-related assets, in particular, could be appropriate. 

Participants might also prefer not to purchase the previously announced 

maximum amounts if they saw greater upside risks to inflation than does the staff.  

(The “Early Liftoff” scenario in the Greenbook, which couples a strong rebound in 

growth with an increase in inflation expectations, illustrates the possible need to 

remove policy accommodation earlier than in the baseline.)  Participants might, for 

example, have some concern that if bankers’ attitudes toward lending were to shift 

rapidly with the improvement in the economic outlook, the large amount of reserves 

in the banking system could bring about a larger and more rapid expansion of bank 

credit, fueling even stronger aggregate demand growth, and potentially leading to 

significantly increased upward pressure on prices.  The recently announced reduction 

in the Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Program, which will increase the amount 

of reserves in the banking system and likely put some downward pressure on the 

funds rate, may also be a consideration.  The Committee may believe that such risks 

would be moderated by purchasing less than the previously announced maximum 

amounts, thereby lowering the accumulation of reserves in the banking system.   

Moreover, participants may perceive less slack in the economy than in the staff 

forecast if they view the very large negative shock of the financial crisis and the 

ensuing recession as having lowered the level and growth rate of potential output 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 42 of 73



 

 

more sharply over the forecast horizon than assumed by the staff.  A less optimistic 

outlook for aggregate supply, and the attendant consequences for inflation, might 

incline the Committee to scale back the LSAPs.  In addition, if policymakers put less 

weight on output gaps and more weight on inflation expectations when forecasting 

inflation, they may prefer to slow the growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet if 

they are concerned that its rapid expansion could fuel inflation expectations; for the 

same reason, they may also want to signal an earlier increase in the federal funds rate 

target than suggested in the Committee’s recent policy statements.   

The adoption of Alternative C would surprise market participants.  As noted 

above, primary dealers expect LSAPs to reach their previously announced maximums.  

Moreover, fewer than 20 percent of the dealers indicated that they expect the federal 

funds rate to be raised above its effective lower bound by next June; another half 

expect the initial rate increase to occur later next year, and the remainder expect 

tightening to begin in 2011 or later.  Indeed, over the intermeeting period, the implied 

path of the federal funds rate based on futures quotes and the staff’s standard 

assumptions about term premiums has shifted downward.  Even if some of that 

decline was a result of decreasing term premiums, it appears that market participants 

expect rates to remain unchanged for at least as long as they did at the time of the last 

meeting.  Thus, the release of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely 

cause short- and medium-term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, 

while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate.  Forward 

inflation compensation might decline over time if the Committee’s decision caused 

investors to mark down their inflation expectations at longer horizons. 

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

If the Committee views the staff’s economic outlook, with its very protracted 

return to full employment, as unacceptably weak despite the upward revision, or if 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 43 of 73



 

 

participants are not convinced that the recent data are signaling the start of a sustained 

economic recovery, policymakers may judge that additional monetary stimulus would 

be appropriate.  In this case, they could decide to expand the amount of agency MBS 

purchases, be more definitive about the total amount to be purchased, and extend the 

timeframe for conducting those transactions, as in Alternative A.  Although the staff 

has marked up its forecast for economic growth significantly, the unemployment rate 

declines only slowly—it is projected to be still above 9 percent at the end of next year 

and just under 8 percent at the end of 2011—and core inflation hovers around 

1 percent for several years, a level below the inflation objectives implicit in individual 

policymakers’  longer-run projections.  Moreover, the Committee may judge that the 

staff forecast is overly optimistic on both the growth and inflation fronts.  The recent 

better-than-expected data might have been driven importantly by temporary factors 

(like the Cash-for-Clunkers program) and thus, may be overstating the degree of 

underlying momentum of the economy.  Recent increases in house prices may not be 

sustained if foreclosures rise appreciably faster or by a greater amount than in the 

Greenbook forecast.  If so, the apparent bottoming out in the housing market could 

be illusory.  In addition, the decline in bank lending and M2 may be interpreted as 

pointing to weaker growth than in the staff forecast.  Given the significant 

deceleration in wages and hourly compensation during the recession, policymakers 

might see a significant risk of greater disinflation than in the staff forecast, as 

discussed in the Greenbook alternative scenario, “Greater Disinflation.” 

Based on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, as well as the downside 

risks to that outlook, the Committee might conclude that further monetary stimulus is 

warranted.  In addition, given the experience to date, the Committee may now be 

more confident that the LSAPs are lowering mortgage rates and that a further 

expansion in LSAPs would be effective in supporting aggregate demand.  Based on 

the staff’s ongoing analysis, the Committee may also be more confident that the 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 44 of 73



 

 

FOMC has the necessary tools to exit from this period of extraordinarily low interest 

rates despite a further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Furthermore, 

the public may have become more confident in the viability of the Federal Reserve’s 

exit strategy now that it has been explained in speeches and testimony by Committee 

members and other participants.  Thus, the perceived benefits of increased LSAPs 

may have risen while the perceived costs may have declined.  If so, the Committee 

may judge that increasing the LSAPs at this juncture, even with the improved outlook, 

is desirable for fostering better economic outcomes.  Being more explicit that the 

Committee plans to purchase the full $1.5 trillion, rather than “up to” the increased 

maximum, would likely result in a larger economic impact.   

The Desk would likely encounter challenges if it were to significantly step up the 

pace of agency MBS purchases.  Thus, the Committee might judge that in order to 

expand the amount of these purchases without having adverse effects on market 

functioning, the timeframe for their completion would need to be expanded.  

Extending the timeframe to the end of the second quarter of 2010 would allow for a 

gradual reduction in the pace of purchases as they near completion.  Expanding the 

amount of purchases of agency debt (or even buying the maximum $200 billion) 

could generate significant distortions in the markets for those securities, so this is not 

proposed in Alternative A. 

An announcement along the lines of Alternative A would surprise market 

participants.  Judging by recent experience, the announcement of an additional $250 

billion in agency MBS could generate an initial drop in mortgage yields and spreads to 

Treasuries.  Equity prices would probably edge up, and the foreign exchange value of 

the dollar might well decline.  Inflation compensation could increase if the 

Committee’s decision prompted renewed investor concerns about the size of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and future inflation.  All of these effects could be 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 45 of 73



 

 

 

magnified if market participants saw the increase in asset purchases as opening the 

door to yet further increases in such transactions.

10 Reflecting concerns that a higher level of purchases could distort pricing and compromise 
market liquidity, agency debt purchases are projected to cumulate to $150 billion, below the 
announced $200 billion upper limit of the program under Alternatives A and B.   

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

Three balance sheet scenarios are presented in this section; they differ in terms of 

the size and timing of large-scale asset purchases.  The baseline scenario corresponds 

to the variant of Alternative B in the Policy Alternatives section, which has agency 

MBS purchases of $1.25 trillion and agency debt purchases of $150 billion both 

completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The second scenario corresponds 

to Alternative A, in which purchases of agency MBS are increased by $250 billion to 

$1.5 trillion and completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  Purchases of 

agency debt are equal to those in the baseline in terms of size but are completed by 

the end of this year rather than at the end of the first quarter of 2010.10  The third 

scenario corresponds to Alternative C, in which the quantity of agency MBS 

purchases is reduced by $250 billion to $1 trillion and agency debt purchases stop at 

$150 billion.  Both sets of purchases are completed by the end of 2009.  All scenarios 

include purchases of Treasury securities in line with the quantity and timing previously 

announced by the FOMC, that is $300 billion of total purchases completed by the end 

of October this year.  

To construct the projections, we made assumptions about each component of the 

balance sheet.  Details on the assumptions are available in Appendix C.  On the asset 

side of the balance sheet, the path of large-scale asset purchases in the baseline 

scenario matches the assumed path in the Greenbook.  All three scenarios assume 

that the assets purchased are held to maturity and not replaced.  Due to expected 

settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings under each alternative peak at 

a slightly lower level than the total amount purchased and a few months after 

purchases have ceased.  For all scenarios, an assumed slower-than-historical-average

11 A discussion of the issues related to the SDR allocation can be found in the memo to the 
FOMC, “Implications of upcoming SDR allocations,” August 4, 2009. 

path for the prepayment of agency MBS implies that more than half of the agency 

MBS purchased are still on the balance sheet in 2016. 

The projections for liquidity and credit programs are essentially the same in all 

three scenarios.  The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is assumed 

to reach a peak of $137 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2010, with 

$87 billion in three-year loans and $50 billion in five-year loans at the peak.  TALF 

loans outstanding reach zero in 2015.  The Commercial Paper Funding Facility 

(CPFF) and the foreign central bank liquidity swap lines are assumed to expire on 

February 1, 2010; funds extended through these facilities wind down to zero by mid-

year 2010.  Credit extended to AIG and the Federal Reserve’s ownership of preferred 

stock interests in AIG reach zero by 2013.  The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, 

Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are assumed to be sold over time; 

they are essentially nil by 2016.  Primary, secondary, and seasonal credit sum to about 

$1 billion from the end of 2010 forward.  Only the Term Auction Facility (TAF) 

remains sizable beyond 2010 at a steady-state level of $20 billion.  In the near term, 

we assume that the TAF will be scaled down.  In particular, the amounts offered at 

84-day auctions will eventually decrease to zero and term lengths will be reduced so 

that these loans mature at the same time as 28-day loans.   By January 2010, only 28-

day auctions will be held.  At the end of 2009, the TAF projection assumes that the 

full amount offered of $125 billion is taken down, but subsequently demand drops 

and the TAF reaches the steady state level by the end of April 2010.  Finally, the 

Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate account is projected to increase by $10 

billion, to $12 billion, by the end of 2011, as a result of an assumed monetization of 

an allocation of SDRs.11   

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 48 of 73



 

 

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, all three scenarios 

assume that currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows at the same rate as 

the staff forecast for money stock currency through 2011 and after that point expands 

at the projected growth rate of nominal GDP in the extended Greenbook forecast.   

Reflecting the Treasury’s announcement regarding the Supplementary Financing 

Program (SFP), the Supplementary Financing Account (SFA) is projected to run 

down to $15 billion by October 2009 and remain there through the end of the year.  

Subsequently, under the assumption that the Congress raises the debt ceiling, the 

balances in the SFA return to $200 billion during the first quarter of 2010 and remain 

at this level through the end of 2015 in the baseline scenario.  At this point, reserve 

balances are falling towards $25 billion and, as a result, the SFP is assumed to begin to 

wind down.  The U.S. Treasury is assumed to continue its recent pattern of 

maintaining all of its operating balances in the Treasury general account (TGA) over 

the next year.  We assume that the Treasury eventually puts in place a new cash 

management system in conjunction with the implementation of new legislation and 

systems and the TGA then returns to its historical level of $5 billion in 2011.  All 

other liabilities with the exception of reverse repurchase agreements (with foreign 

official and international accounts) and reserve balances are assumed to be constant at 

their level as of August 31, 2009.  Federal Reserve Bank capital is projected to grow in 

line with its average pace of expansion over the past ten years.   

Under all scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands rapidly over the 

course of 2009.  For the baseline scenario, the balance sheet reaches a peak of 

$2.4 trillion in the second quarter of 2010 and then declines to a level of $1.4 trillion 

at the end of the projection period.  For Alternative A, the peak also occurs in the 

second quarter of 2010 but at a higher level of $2.6 trillion.  Assets then decline to 

roughly $1.6 trillion at the end of 2016.  For Alternative C, the balance sheet peaks at

12 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably 
from historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 
percent of assets and the Federal Reserve did not hold any agency mortgage-backed 
securities.  By contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasuries are projected to account for 
only around 33 percent of total assets at the end of 2009 and rise to just 36 percent of total 
assets at the end of the projection period.  

$2.2 trillion at the end of 2009, and assets decline to $1.4 trillion at the end of the 

projection period.12

These projections for liabilities and capital, combined with the assumed path for 

assets, largely imply a path for reserve balances under each scenario.  Note, however, 

that the level of reserve balances was considered in determining the projected use of 

credit and liquidity facilities, so the projected path is not purely a residual.  In all three 

scenarios, the implied paths of reserve balances rise rapidly until the end of 2009.  The 

timing of the peak and the eventual decline in the size of the balance sheet differs 

across alternatives, however.  In the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives A and B, 

reserve balances peak in June of 2010, whereas in Alternative C, they peak in

13 The calculated growth rates of the monetary base presented in the table are based on an 
approximation for month-average values.  

December of this year.  Reserve balances decline as the balance sheet shrinks in all 

scenarios, but in Alternative C, a resumption of open market purchases is assumed in 

2016 to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion. 

Projections for the growth rates of the monetary base are derived from these 

balance sheet projections as the growth rate of the sum of Federal Reserve notes in 

circulation and reserve balances.13  After contracting in the third quarter of this year 

the monetary base is projected to expand rapidly in the fourth quarter under all 

scenarios.  At a quarterly frequency, the monetary base continues to expand for the 

first three quarters of 2010 for Alternative A and B.  In 2011, however, as securities 

holdings trend lower and the liquidity facilities wind down, the monetary base begins 

to contract. For Alternative C, in which asset purchases end in 2009, the monetary 

base begins to contract in the first quarter of 2010.  For all three alternatives, the 

monetary base continues to contract as assets mature and the balance sheet shrinks.  

For Alternatives B and C, this contraction is reversed near the end of the projection 

horizon. 

Relative to the August Bluebook, there are a number of notable changes to the 

projections.  The initial size of the balance sheet at the end of August was $95 billion 

lower than projected at the time of the last Bluebook, primarily because agency MBS 

purchases and settlements were smaller than forecasted.  The pattern of purchases of 

agency debt and agency MBS has been modified in the new projections, as the 

completion dates of the programs were extended from the end of this year to the end 

of the first quarter of 2010 under the baseline scenario.  For the liquidity and credit 

programs, the projection for the TAF no longer includes an uptick at the end of the 

year.  The TALF is assumed to extend a somewhat lower volume of loans than 

previously.  Some of the other lending facilities are now seen as running off slightly

faster than was projected last round in light of the improvement in financial markets 

and more widely available liquidity and credit.  On balance, total assets at year-end 

2009 are about $356 billion lower in this projection compared with that presented in 

the August Bluebook, mostly a result of the change in assumptions about the TAF 

and the timing of agency MBS purchases.  By the end of the projection period in 

2016, however, total assets are not much different than the level projected in the 

August Bluebook because the primary changes to the baseline scenario between the 

two Bluebooks are related to the timing, rather than the level, of large-scale assets 

purchases.  

On the liabilities side, the staff has made significant changes to the projections 

relative to the August Bluebook.  The path for the SFA is very different.  In the near 

term, the account is drawn down to a very low level until the beginning of 2010.  

Thereafter, the account is assumed to return to its previous $200 billion level until the 

program is run down as reserve balances approach $25 billion late in the projection 

period.  In the last Bluebook the SFA was expected to be drawn down to zero by the 

second half of 2010.  Moreover, the TGA is now assumed to return to its historical 

level at the end of 2010 rather than this year.  On net, the level of reserve balances is 

about $244 billion lower at the end of this year, primarily reflecting the slower pace of 

agency MBS purchases and a lower use of the TAF over year-end.  The level of 

reserve balances remains considerably below that projected in the August Bluebook 

through the projection period primarily as a result of the new assumption with regards 

to the SFA. 

The extended Greenbook projection shows the target federal funds rate rising 

from the current 0 to ¼ percent range to 2.4 percent over the course of 2012.  Under 

the operating procedures employed before the financial crisis, the projected level of 

reserve balances at the end of 2012 of approximately $600 billion would not have 

been consistent with a federal funds rate significantly above zero.  If the interest rate 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 52 of 73



 

 

  

paid on excess reserve balances becomes an effective floor for the federal funds rate, a 

higher target rate could be achieved even with quite elevated reserve balances simply 

by raising the excess reserves rate.  Such a path is implicit in these projections.  The 

experience last autumn, however, when the effective federal funds rate fell well below 

the rate paid on excess reserves, may suggest that other tools could be needed to 

improve the control over the funds rate.  Such tools might include reverse repurchase 

agreements, outright sales of securities, a term deposit facility, or other strategies.  The 

balance sheet effects of these tools, however, are not included in these projections.

BANK CREDIT, DEBT, AND MONEY FORECAST 

The outlook for nonfederal debt growth and bank credit expansion continues to 

be quite weak, consistent with the staff’s forecast of a moderate economic recovery 

and only gradual improvement in the health of the banking system.  M2 is also likely 

to be weak as a result of slow income growth, anemic increases in bank credit, and a 

continued gradual reallocation of household wealth toward riskier assets.  

Bank credit is forecast to contract 4½ percent this year.  This is a sharper drop 

than previously projected and reflects persistent declines in most major loan 

categories through the fourth quarter of 2009 that are only partially offset by 

purchases of securities.  This would be the first annual decline in nominal bank credit 

since 1948.  Growth in bank credit is expected to increase gradually to about 4¼ 

percent in 2010 and 6½ percent in 2011, a bit more than in the previous projection, 

reflecting the staff’s improved outlook for economic activity over the forecast period.  

However, loan growth remains particularly weak until late in 2010, partly reflecting 

concern among lenders about further deterioration in credit quality and its potential 

impact on their own capital positions. 

Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand at an annual rate of 

about [5] percent through 2011, reflecting continued rapid growth of federal debt, a 

moderate rise in state and local government debt, and a gradual resumption of growth 

in household and business borrowing.  Federal debt is projected to increase rapidly 

over the forecast period because of continued large deficits.  State and local 

government borrowing is expected to slow from its recent rapid pace, in part because 

stimulus grants will finance some of the projected rise in the sector’s capital outlays.  

Private-sector debt is expected to pick up gradually.  Growth in household debt is 

forecast to begin to edge up early next year as the economy improves, but the rise will 

be constrained by the elevated unemployment rate, continued deleveraging by

households, and lending standards that ease only gradually.  Despite expected further 

improvement in conditions in capital markets, borrowing by nonfinancial businesses 

is expected to remain sluggish over the next several years, owing to weakness in 

commercial real estate markets and relatively tight lending standards at banks. 

M2 is projected to continue contracting in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first 

quarter of 2010 as households reallocate more of their wealth toward riskier assets.  

The contraction is accounted for by substantial declines in small time deposits and 

retail money market mutual funds, which partly reflect low and declining interest rates 

on those instruments.  Over the course of next year, M2 is forecast to increase less 

rapidly than nominal GDP, as the run-off of safe-haven M2 assets continues amid 

improvements in economic and financial market conditions.  In 2011, the staff 

expects M2 to accelerate to about 5 percent, somewhat less than the growth rate of 

nominal GDP.

DIRECTIVE 

The August directive and draft language for the September directive are provided 

below. 

AUGUST FOMC MEETING 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 

during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit 

markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should 

depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment 

of private credit market conditions.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 

billion in housing-related agency debt and up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the 

end of the year.  The Desk is expected to purchase about $300 billion of longer-term 

Treasury securities by the end of October, gradually slowing the pace of these 

purchases until they are completed.  The Committee anticipates that outright 

purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to 

expand significantly in coming months.  The System Open Market Account Manager 

and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments 

regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the 

Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL RATE 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.   

Measure  Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation. 

September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 65 of 73



 

 

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS   
For the following rules,

 denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

Outcome-based rule it

Forecast-based rule it

Taylor (1993) rule it

Taylor (1999) rule it

First-difference rule it

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS   
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  

NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND 
MONETARY BASE  

This appendix presents more detail on the assumptions underlying the long-run projections of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the monetary base shown in the section entitled “Long-Run 
Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from September 2009 to December 2016.  
The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be constant over the 
projection period at the level for August 31, 2009.  The projections for all major asset and liability 
categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the bullet points. 

ASSETS 

Asset Purchases 
• The baseline scenario incorporates large-scale asset purchases roughly in line with those that 

have been announced. 
o The Desk purchases a total of $300 billion of Treasury securities, $150 billion of 

agency debt, and $1.25 trillion of agency MBS. 
o Purchases of Treasury securities are expected to be completed by October 2009, and 

purchases of agency debt and agency MBS are to be completed by the end of the 
first quarter of 2010. 

o The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities purchased is based on FRBNY 
Markets Group internal forecasts.  The maturities of most purchases are between 
two and ten years, with the weighted average maturity being a little over six years. 

o No sales of Treasury securities are assumed, and maturing securities are not rolled 
over.  As a result, total holdings of Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  
Treasury securities held in the SOMA portfolio prior to the initiation of the large-
scale asset purchase are assumed to be reinvested as they mature.   

o Agency debt holdings peak at $147 billion in March of 2010, and decline slowly over 
the remainder of the forecast horizon as they mature.   

o Due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings peak at 
$1.15 trillion in June 2010, a slightly lower level than the amount purchased.  For 
agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates from one of the 
investment managers.  The historically low coupon on these securities implies a 
relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a result, at the end of 2016, $731 billion of the 
$1.25 trillion of MBS purchased remains on the balance sheet. 

• In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, purchases of agency MBS are increased by 
$250 billion to $1.5 trillion and the purchases (but not settlement) are completed by the first 
quarter of 2010. The purchases are spread equally over the coming months until the

14 On March 2, the Federal Reserve and Treasury jointly announced a restructuring of the government’s assistance to 

AIG.  As part of this restructuring, the revolving credit facility will be reduced in exchange for preferred interests in 
two SPVs created to hold all the common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.  It is assumed that the total size of the 
assistance to AIG is not directly affected by this restructuring. 

completion date. Agency debt purchases amount to $150 billion and are completed by the 
end of 2009. 

• In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, purchases of agency MBS are decreased by 
$250 billion to $1 trillion. Moreover, the purchases (but not settlement) are completed by the 
end of 2009. Purchases are decreased equally over the over the remaining months of 2009. 
Agency debt purchases mirror those in the scenario corresponding to Alternative A.  

• By the end of the projection period in the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the 
expansion of currency and capital combined with a runoff of other assets necessitates the 
resumption of standard open market purchases to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 
billion.  It is assumed that the Desk purchases Treasury securities to satisfy these needs. 

Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
• The assumptions about the liquidity programs and credit facilities are the same across 

Alternatives. 
• Primary credit is assumed to decline moderately from its current level to $1 billion by the 

end of 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero for 
the entire projection period. 

• Only the Term Auction Facility (TAF) remains sizable beyond 2010 at a steady-state level of 
$20 billion.  In the near term, we assume that the TAF will be scaled down.  In particular, 
the amounts offered at 84-day auctions will eventually decrease to zero and term lengths will 
be reduced so that these loans mature at the same time as 28-day loans.  By January 2010, 
only 28-day auctions will be held.  At the end of 2009, the TAF projection assumes that the 
full amount offered of $125 billion is taken down, but subsequently demand drops and the 
TAF reaches the steady state level by the end of April 2010.  

• Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decline with improved market functioning and fall to 
zero a few months following the expiration date of the program on February 1, 2010.   

• Credit extended to and preferred stock interests in AIG wind down by the end of 2013.14  In 
addition, the assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III 
LLC are assumed to be sold over time and reach a nominal level by 2016.   

• The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), based partly on its slow initial 
uptake, is assumed to peak at $137 billion in June 2010, well below the $1 trillion limit. 

o TALF loans with a three-year maturity reach $87 billion by the program’s assumed 
expiration date of March 31, 2010.  A portion of these loans are expected to prepay, 
and the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the end of the first quarter of 2013. 

o TALF loans with a five-year maturity reach $50 billion by the end of June 2010.  
These loans are assumed to be held to maturity, and the quantity outstanding reaches 
zero by the end of 2015. 

• Reflecting improvements in market conditions, the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money 
Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) and Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)

are expected to continue to be unused.  Credit extended through the Commercial Paper 
Funding Facility (CPFF) winds down to zero a few months after the facility expires on 
February 1, 2010.  

Other 
• The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate account is projected to increase by $10 billion, 

to $12 billion, by the end of 2011, as a result of an assumed monetization of the allocation of 
SDRs. 

LIABILITIES 
• Currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows in line with the staff forecast for 

money stock currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the projection 
period, currency grows at the same rate as nominal GDP as projected in the extended 
Greenbook forecast. 

• The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) is projected to follow the Staff forecast of 
Treasury’s end of period total cash balance without the Supplementary Financing Program 
(SFP) through March 2010.  In essence, this assumption implies that the Treasury continues 
to maintain all of its operating cash at the Federal Reserve over that period. Thereafter, the 
TGA returns to its historical target level of $5 billion by the end of 2010.  This account 
remains constant at that level over the forecast period. 

• In the near term, movements in the Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account (SFA) 
reflect constraints Treasury faces with the debt limit.  Reflecting the Treasury’s 
announcement regarding the SFP, the SFA is projected to run down to $15 billion by 
October 2009 and remain there through the end of the year.  Subsequently, under the 
assumption that the Congress raises the debt ceiling, the balances in the SFA return to $200 
billion during the first quarter of 2010 and remains at this level through the end of 2015.  At 
this point, reserve balances are falling towards $25 billion and, as a result, the Supplementary 
Financing Program is assumed to run down. 

• Reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official and international accounts are expected 
to decrease to $30 billion by the end of 2009 as these funds move to other investments.   

• Capital is expected to grow at 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 

• As the asset side of the balance sheet expands and contracts, so do reserve balances.  Over 
the projection period, reserve balances in the baseline scenario are expected to peak at $1.2 
trillion and then fall to $25 billion.
