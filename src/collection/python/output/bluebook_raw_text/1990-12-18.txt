MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) At the beginning of the intermeeting period the Desk imple-

mented a slight easing of reserve market conditions, intended to be as-

sociated with the federal funds rate decreasing around 1/4 percentage

point to the area of 7-1/2 percent. The funds rate responded sluggishly,

however, with the "effective" rate averaging about 20 basis points above

that level in the first full maintenance period after the November meet-

ing. The relatively high effective rate initially reflected cautious

reserve management by banks and the settlement of the midquarter refund-

ing, and later the increasing premiums paid by foreign banks, particularly

Japanese institutions, which were bidding strongly for overnight funds in

unreceptive markets. Policy was eased again on December 7, on the heels

of the November employment report, which showed surprisingly large job

losses and only modest wage gains, and in light of continuing weakness in

the monetary aggregates. Since then, federal funds have averaged around

the expected 7-1/4 percent. Premiums paid by Japanese banks have narrowed

as concerns about year-end pressures abated somewhat [discussed in para-

graph (3) below] and reserves have been more abundant relative to depress-

ed demands for excess reserves.

1. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged $169 million in the
first full maintenance period after the November meeting and $106 mil-
lion in the second period ended this Wednesday, in both instances some-
what below the borrowing assumptions for those periods. Including a
decrease to $225 million right after the last meeting, the borrowing
assumption has been reduced five times--most recently to $100 million--
including two policy-related adjustments of $25 million each and techni-
cal adjustments to reflect the declines in seasonal borrowing.

(2) Market interest rates declined on balance over the inter-

meeting period, in some cases substantially, as policy eased and evidence

mounted that the economy was contracting significantly. Short-term rates,

which, at the time of the November meeting, already incorporated expecta-

tions of a slightly more accommodative policy, retreated 20 to 40 basis

points. Bond yields are off by comparable amounts; with most of the drop

occurring since the November employment data were released. Mortgage

rates have retreated 1/2 percentage point over the last month to around

9-1/2 percent. Lower interest rates and optimism over a possible peaceful

resolution of the Middle East situation contributed to a rise in broad

stock indexes of about 3 percent. Bank stocks have done better, buoyed by

the reduction in reserve requirements.

(3) In the first half of the intermeeting period, concern about

a liquidity squeeze over year-end intensified. In bank funding markets,

three-month Eurodollar and domestic CD rates rose some 40 basis points in

the last week of November. At that time, Japanese banks reportedly paid

as much as 30 percent in the forward market for federal funds over the

turn of the year, and domestic banks saw quotes of 15 percent or more,

though they did little buying. Commercial paper rates, especially on

lower-rated issues, also rose substantially relative to Treasury bill

rates in this period. Expectations already had been widespread that year-

end credit could be especially scarce this year as institutional investors

purged their portfolios of lower quality names, shifting demands toward

banks just when those lenders would be trying to minimize assets to bol-

ster capital ratios. Potential year-end borrowers, and in particular the

Japanese banks, apparently began to focus on this problem in earnest after



Thanksgiving, and sought to secure funding in advance. In the event, this

scramble for financing quickly abated and spreads on bank instruments

relative to Treasuries more than retraced their earlier increases. The

highest graded commercial paper rates also have fallen substantially rela-

tive to Treasuries, but tiering in this market has increased on balance

since the November meeting. The retreat in rates was assisted by the

announcement of lower reserve requirements, which was perceived as freeing

up valuable liquidity around year-end, and, in concert with some leaning

to the generous side in the provision of reserves by the Desk, as signall-

ing an intent to provide ample funds through this period. Still, markets

remain quite sensitive to the potential for year-end disruptions and in

recent days spreads have widened some, and Japanese banks are paying as

much as 20 percent for funds over the end of the year.

(4) Despite the easing of U.S. monetary policy, the dollar's

weighted average foreign exchange value is up about one percent on balance

since the last FOMC meeting, apparently supported in part by precautionary

demands for dollars in view of concerns about the availability of dollar

funding over year-end. The dollar appreciated more against the yen and

sterling; the decrease in oil prices along with expectations of slowing or

negative economic growth sparked large bond market rallies in these and

other countries. In Japan bond yields fell about 70 basis points, while

short-term rates there edged lower. The dollar rose less against the

mark, which was generally firm on the basis of continuing very strong

economic growth in Western Germany and heightened expectations of further

tightening of monetary policy. Three-month interest rates moved up about



30 basis points in Germany, while long-term rates declined about the same

amount, less than in other major countries.

(5) M2 contracted slightly in November, leaving this aggregate

slightly below the path anticipated by the Committee at its last meet-

ing. Money market fund shares declined, as did overnight RPs; the

former seemed to be associated with investors returning to the capital

markets, especially through stock and bond funds, and the latter was prob-

ably related to recent declines in securities holdings at large banks.

Still, the continued weakness of core deposits, despite the fall in oppor-

tunity costs to their lowest levels of the year, was the predominant

influence damping M2. Weak nominal income growth this quarter likely

accounts in part for the depressed demands for M2, especially as house-

holds hold down saving in order to cushion the effect of declining dis-

posable income on consumption.

(6) November's runoff deepened the already considerable weakness

of M2; for the year M2 is expected to expand only 3-3/4 percent, down from

its 1989 growth rate and well below the middle of its target range (see

table below). Expansion of M2 has been held down by the slower growth of

income in 1990; in addition, velocity increased nearly 1 percent, despite

declines in short-term interest rates. One development damping the ef-

fects of lower market interest rates on M2 was wider opportunity costs

than historically have been associated with observed movements in interest

rates. In light of the thrift resolution process and the reluctance of

2. M1 expanded at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate, after a decline in
October. Transactions deposits rebounded but currency slowed sharply,
perhaps partly reflecting reductions in recent heavy overseas shipments.
Total reserves and the monetary base expanded at 3-3/4 and 4-3/4 percent
rates in November, respectively.

banks to extend credit, depositories as a whole had no need for increased

liabilities, and they offered relatively less attractive deposit rates to

discourage retail inflows. Nonetheless, opportunity costs did narrow and

the lower opportunity costs that prevailed should have reduced velocity;

staff models of money demand overpredict M2 growth by 2 percentage points

this year. The reasons for this are unclear. From the depositor's per-

spective, claims on depositories may look less attractive if there are

concerns about the health of depositories and the possibility of deposit

contracts being abrogated in a failure. A shift out of M2 is consistent

with the unusually high volume of net noncompetitive tenders for Treasury

securities this year. Households also may be restraining liquid asset

accumulation to limit indebtedness as the return on deposits falls rela-

tive to the cost of debt; household indebtedness this year has grown slow-

ly relative to spending. And demand deposits have declined further in

1990 despite the fall in interest rates, as businesses apparently rely

less on deposits to compensate banks for services and continue to find

ways to economize on clearing balances.

1. Lowered in July from 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.



(7) M3 contracted slightly again in November and has expanded

only 1-1/2 percent in 1990, just above the lower limit of a target range

that the Committee reduced by 1-1/2 percentage points in July. The be-

havior of M3 is directly related to the slump in depository credit.

Depository liabilities in M3 have contracted this year, in line with lend-

ing, and all of the net inflows to M3 are attributable to currency and

money market mutual funds.

(8) Evidence about private borrowing trends in recent months is

mixed, though no real strength is apparent and lenders remain very cau-

tious. Some pickup has been seen in business credit in recent weeks,

boosted by a surge in bond issuance by investment grade borrowers in

response to the drop in long-term rates. However, commercial paper has

been declining since the middle of October, as some quality borrowers have

turned to bonds and some less favored issuers have opted to tap their bank

lines in the face of mounting investor resistance to their paper. Accord-

ingly, bank C&I loans grew at a 5-3/4 percent rate in November, after two

months of decline. Banks apparently have continued to tighten lending

terms and raise margins, in part by keeping the prime rate unchanged in

the face of lower funding costs. Consumer borrowing probably has remained

subdued; consumer loans at banks, adjusting for securitization, registered

minimal gains in November. Municipal borrowing has been brisk in recent

days in response to the bond market rally, though activity in November was

sluggish. Credit stress is spreading in the municipal sector, as state

and local budget situations worsen. Federal borrowing has continued



strong, with a lull in thrift-related spending offsetting a widening bud-

get gap elsewhere.

(9) Robust federal borrowing boosted the growth of nonfinancial

debt to 7 percent for the year, the midpoint of its range. However, a

significant portion of the federal borrowing has simply financed acquisi-

tions of thrift assets via the RTC; without this factor debt growth would

have been 6-1/2 percent. Private debt growth is likely to come in at only

5-1/2 percent for the year, down from 7-1/2 percent last year. Although

reduced demands for credit account for much of the slowing, credit

restraint also likely was a factor, having an appreciable effect on bor-

rowing for some real estate purposes and also on corporate restructuring;

the decline in net equity retirement accounts for a sizeable share of the

deceleration in private debt growth this year.

Policy Alternatives

(10) Two near-term policy alternatives are presented below for

Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would con-

tinue to trade in the 7-1/4 percent area and adjustment plus seasonal bor-

rowing would initially be specified at $100 million.3 Under alternative

A, the funds rate would decline to the vicinity of 6-3/4 percent. Alter-

native A could be implemented through a reduction in the borrowing assump-

tion of only $25 million to $75 million or through a half-point cut in the

discount rate combined with the same borrowing assumption as specified for

alternative B.4

(11) Implementing alternative A through a reduction in borrowing

would bring the funds rate below the discount rate and borrowing to fric-

tional levels. While technically feasible, this method of easing would

have some drawbacks. For one, moving the federal funds rate below the

discount rate might add to market uncertainties; it could prompt specula-

tion about whether this unusual situation portended a near-term discount

rate change, in part to restore more normal rate relationships, or whether

it represented a permanent realignment of the discount rate at a penalty

to market rates. In addition, the federal funds rate probably would be-

come a little more volatile. Increases and decreases in borrowing can

provide a safety valve, partly offsetting the effects on the federal funds

3. Another $25 million reduction perhaps would be called for as sea-
sonal borrowing moves down to its normal annual trough in mid-January;
this would also apply to alternative A.
4. Because of the unusually low levels of borrowing at present, this

reduction is half the difference between alternatives A and B in recent
bluebooks.



-10-

rate of unexpected shifts in supply and demand for reserves. The poten-

tial for such offsets, with their muting effect on funds rate variations,

is already quite limited, given the damped responses of borrowing to funds

rate fluctuations associated with the current low level of discount window

usage. Funds rate volatility would tend to increase a bit if borrowing

were reduced to implement alternative A. In any case, over the intermeet-

ing period the Desk's task will be complicated by uncertainties both about

year-end effects on required and excess reserve demands and about the

impact of the reserve requirement change on demands for excess reserves.

The potential for volatility in the funds rate under alternative A would

be reduced a little if instead this alternative were implemented through a

1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate, leaving a larger cushion of

borrowing.

(12) Securities markets appear to be anticipating another small

policy adjustment at some point in the coming intermeeting period, though

not necessarily immediately after the meeting. Hence, market interest and

exchange rates would not react much to the unchanged reserve conditions of

alternative B, at least initially. Moreover, expectations of further ease

likely would be sustained if incoming data confirm the markets' impression

of a significant economic downturn. Although borrowers and lenders

5. A more moderate policy easing that involved a 1/2 percentage point
cut in the discount rate to 6-1/2 percent, combined with an initial
borrowing specification of $125 million, could lessen a bit further the
potential volatility of the funds rate, at least once the market recog-
nized the new intended trading area of 7 percent for the funds rate. In
this case, the funds rate would decline 1/4 percentage point, but its
spread over the discount rate would return to 1/2 percentage point.



-11-

already have made substantial adjustments to their portfolios in anticipa-

tion of year-end pressures, strains still could emerge at times in coming

weeks. In January, with the threat of year-end pressures and portfolio

adjustments behind them, banks may reduce the prime rate. Were current

reserve conditions to be maintained through the intermeeting period in the

face of weak economic data, markets might begin to reassess the Federal

Reserve's intentions, and interest and exchange rates might edge higher--

although favorable effects on inflation expectations would work to moder-

ate any such rise in bond rates.

(13) With the easing of the funds rate by 1/2 percentage point

under alternative A, other short-term market rates would decline, but by

smaller amounts given current market expectations. However, the prime

rate likely would be reduced, perhaps promptly, by the full 1/2 percentage

point. The policy easing also might make lenders a bit more willing to

extend credit to marginal borrowers, in part as lower interest rates im-

prove the economic outlook and borrowers' prospective creditworthiness.

Bond yields would continue to move lower, but the extent of the rally

would depend in part on the reaction in foreign exchange markets. The

dollar would decline, especially if investors saw the action, coming on

the heels of recent easing moves, as evidence of an inclination toward a

more aggressive easing posture by the Federal Reserve. The reaction of

foreign exchange and other financial markets to alternative A may depend

on how it is implemented. However, any tendency for a discount rate cut

to have an independent announcement effect would be muted in the current



-12-

circumstances, given perceptions that for technical reasons an easing of

this magnitude would necessarily involve a discount rate cut.

(14) Projected growth of the monetary aggregates under the two

alternatives is shown in the table below. (Detailed data appear on the

table and charts on the following pages.) Monetary growth rates seem

unusually difficult to forecast in current circumstances. The uncer-

tainties about the relationship of money demand to income and opportunity

costs, so evident in recent months, are likely to persist. In addition,

changes in the regulatory environment--including reduced reserve require-

ments on certain liabilities, higher deposit insurance premiums, and the

phase-in of capital standards--will be affecting to an unpredictable

extent bank and thrift decisions with respect to the size of their asset

portfolios and the composition of and offering rates on their liabilities.

(15) In the staff's judgment, M2 growth under the unchanged

November to March, placing the aggregate just above the lower bound of the

cone associated with the Committee's provisional growth range of 2-1/2 to

6-1/2 percent for 1991. Stronger growth of nominal income should bol-

ster money balances in the first quarter. In addition, money market

mutual funds and, to a lesser extent, retail deposits are expected to

respond to the drop in their opportunity costs brought about by the de-

clines in short-term market rates over recent months. Even so, M2 growth

on a quarterly average basis would edge up to only a 2-3/4 percent rate in

the first quarter, which would be below the projected pace of nominal GNP

and represent a reversal of the decline in M2 velocity experienced this

quarter.

(16) Some of the acceleration in M2 under alternative B would

show through to M3. Nonetheless, M3 expansion would be held to a 1/2

percent rate from November to March, displaying only slightly less weak-

ness than in recent months and coming in below the one percent lower bound

of the Committee's provisional growth range for 1991. A variety of fac-

tors are expected to continue to limit growth in this aggregate. Thrift

credit is projected to contract further; bank credit expansion, though

likely to pick up after the turn of the year, should remain subdued, espe-

cially if further losses in loan portfolios continue to put pressure on

capital positions. In the near term, banks are likely to use some of the

reserve balances released by the drop in reserve requirements to pay down

managed liabilities and shrink their footings. For a time, this scale

effect should dominate the longer-term impact of the reduced reserve cost

of issuing nonpersonal time deposits and borrowing from own foreign

branches. Finally, the hike in the insurance premium from 12 to 19-1/2

6. M1 growth of 4 percent is foreseen from November to March. With
projected growth rates of 6 percent for currency and 3 percent for
transaction deposits over the four months, the implied growth of the
monetary base would be 5 percent.

basis points on domestic deposits at commercial banks may marginally deter

bank intermediation and encourage a shifting of large time deposits into

term RPs or offshore. Of course, M3 would be little affected on net by

such shifting since term RPs and term Eurodollars owned by U.S. residents

are included in M3.

(17) Debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to grow at only a

4-1/2 percent pace from November to March. This rate is a bit below its

recent estimated pace, despite a pickup in corporate borrowing associated

with merger-related financing, reflecting weak demand in an environment of

continued credit stringency. Household borrowing is expected to slow

further as mortgage demands drop off with the housing slump. With federal

debt growth remaining around 10 percent, overall domestic nonfinancial

debt is anticipated to post about a 6 percent growth rate from November to

March, placing this aggregate in the middle portion of the Committee's

provisional monitoring range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1991.

(18) Selection of alternative A would provide added impetus to

M2 growth but would affect M3 and credit expansion only a little, at least

over the next few months. Opportunity costs on retail balances would fall

further, lifting M2 growth to a projected 5 percent rate over the November

to March period. By March, M2 would be near the midpoint of the pro-

visional range for next year. With banks slightly more inclined to lend,

M3 growth would be stimulated a bit: Its expected 1 percent rate of

deposits was accompanied by a surge in net Eurodollar borrowing. The
average level of domestic deposits at the ends of the third and fourth
quarters of 1990 determine the base for the assessment of the deposit
insurance premium over the first half of 1991.



-16-

growth from November to March would place this aggregate at the lower

bound of its tentative annual range.

Directive Language

(19) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

usual options and updating, is shown below. In light of the large number

of recommendations for a discount rate reduction from Reserve Bank boards

of directors, wording is given in brackets in the first sentence should

the Committee wish to make reference in the directive to a possible

change in the discount rate. This suggested wording is very similar to

that used by the Committee in comparable situations in the past. Of

course, the policy record would explain the Committee's approach to

implementation and its rationale. In the second sentence, given the

evidence of a downturn in business activity, it is suggested that the

phrase "trends in economic activity" be substituted for "strength of the

business expansion."

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly (SOMEWHAT)/
