Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Recent Developments

(1) Following strong growth in February, M-1A and M-1B con-

tracted in March and data for early April suggest that these aggregates

are likely to decline further this month. As shown in the fourth column

of the table, M-1A and M-1B are now expected to decline over the two-month

February to April period, at rates of 3-3/4 and 2-1/2 percent, respectively.

Thus, these aggregates have been running quite low relative to the targeted

growth rates based on the Committee's decision at the March FOMC meeting.

M-2 also has been running weak relative to target recently, reflecting

mainly the contraction in the narrow measures of the money stock. Growth

in MMMF's slowed earlier in March and then declined absolutely following

the imposition of special deposit requirements on March 14, but this has

been offset by greater strength in small time deposits.

(2) In constructing the nonborrowed reserve path following the

March FOMC meeting, borrowing was assumed to be $2-3/4 billion. However,

early in the intermeeting period it seemed clear that the newly instituted

surcharge was exerting a significant constraint on the demand for borrowing

for reserve adjustment purposes relative to initial expectations. As a

result, a substantial upward adjustment was made to the nonborrowed reserve

path; this adjustment amounted to $600 million, viewed--because of the

uncertainties involved--as the center of a $450 to $750 million range.

This, together with certain adjustments for multiplier shifts, raised the

targeted rate of growth for nonborrowed reserves over the February to

April period to a range centered on 4.9 percent, at an annual rate, as

shown in the middle column of the table below.

(3) In the event, nonborrowed reserves declined from February to

the average for the three weeks ending April 16 by 6-1/4 percent at an

annual rate, but this decline in nonborrowed reserves reflected a rise in

emergency-type borrowing by one large member bank (to a level of $420 million



on average during the first three weeks of April). Emergency-type borrowing

is considered to be similar to nonborrowed reserves because the bank is

not subject to normal administrative pressure to repay the borrowing in

the short-run. Thus, adjusting for such borrowing, nonborrowed reserves

rose by 0.6 percent at an annual rate over the period, as shown in the
1/

parenthesis in the last column of the table, a bit below path. With the

aggregates expanding below targeted rates, and required reserves therefore

considerably weaker than expected, the seasonally adjusted growth in total

reserves fell substantially below its path.

(4) As the demand for reserves weakened relative to nonborrowed

path levels, the funds rate declined in the course of the intermeeting period,

with most trading in the 18 to 18-1/2 percent area in recent days. In the

early weeks of the intermeeting period, the federal funds market had

tightened considerably further, and the funds rate exceeded 19 percent

in late March and early April. Pressures on the funds market in part

appeared to reflect efforts of banks to avoid borrowing at the discount

window in light of their changed perception of administrative pressure

following adoption of the surcharge and the Special Credit Restraint

Program announced on March 14. Member bank borrowing other than emergency-

type borrowing averaged about $1.9 billion in the first three statement

1/ See Appendix I for paths and adjustments during intermeeting period
on a not seasonally adjusted basis.



weeks of April. Such borrowing subject to the surcharge averaged less than

$100 million over the period.

(5) Short-term financial markets continued to exhibit consider-

able volatility over the intermeeting period, as market participants reacted

to the announcement of the Administration's anti-inflation package, un-

expected Treasury financings, weakening economic indicators, the initial

sharp increase in the federal funds rate, and the most recent decline in

that rate. In the last few days, market expectations have shifted dramatically

in reflection of weak economic statistics, and both short- and long-term

interest rates extended their decline which had begun earlier in the month.

On balance, most short-term rates are 1 to 3 percentage points lower than

at the time of the last meeting. Commercial banks raised their prime rate

from 18-1/2 percent in mid-March to 20 percent in early April before reduc-

ing it to 19-1/2 percent more recently. Bond yields are now 1 to 1-1/2 per-

centage points below their levels at the time of the last meeting. Mortgage

rates at S&Ls have leveled off, but at a record 16.35 percent are up nearly

1 percentage point since mid-March.

(6) Business lending by banks slowed sharply in March from the

rapid pace set in January and February, and growth of other categories of

bank lending and investing also moderated. Data for large banks for early

April do not suggest any strengthening of loan growth. Total loans and

investments at banks expanded at only a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in

March. Lending by thrift institutions may also have slowed in March, as

thrift deposit flows remained weak. Borrowing from the Home Loan Banks by

S&Ls surged to a record $3.6 billion in March and has continued to rise



rapidly in the early weeks of April. Life insurance companies have sharply

reduced their commitment activity in bond and mortgage markets as policy

loans and diminished inflows from pension funds have severely curtailed

cash flows.

(7) The dollar's exchange value has changed little on balance

since the last FOMC meeting, with a large appreciation followed by a sharp

decline. By early April the trade-weighted value of the dollar was 3-1/2

percent above its level at the time of the last Committee meeting and

11-3/4 percent above its January low. In the second week of April, a

change in market expectations about the near-term course of U.S. interest

rates led to a sharp decline in the international value of the dollar.

M-1B by June that are on the midpoint paths of the Committee's longer-run

QIV '79 to QIV '80 target ranges for these aggregates. As indicated in

May-June growth in these aggregates would have to accelerate to about a

9½ percent annual rate to attain the June target level. Such growth over

a two-month span is relatively strong historically, but not without precedent

for this volatile series. Even though real GNP is expected to decline

significantly this quarter, the rate of increase in nominal GNP is still

projected at over an 8 percent annual rate, suggesting a need for appreciable

growth in transactions balances.1/ However, given the restraining effects

on money demanded of past increases in interest rates, and with real economic

activity apparently slowing significantly, the May-June increases in M-1A

and M-1B required under alternative B may lead to a decline in the federal

funds rate to the 16 to 17 percent area, or perhaps even lower, over the

intermeeting period.

(11) The specifications for alternative B call for a 6¾ percent

rate of growth of M-2 for the December-June period, and a 6¼ percent rate

from March to June. Such growth would leave this aggregate in June below

the midpoint of its longer-run range, as shown in Chart 2. The December-

June growth is about 1 percentage point below that adopted by the Committee

in March, as the expected continued sluggishness of money market mutual

funds is not fully offset by stronger deposit flows.

(12) Bank credit growth under any of the alternatives is likely

to pick up over the next few months from the low March pace, although a

return to the elevated January-February rates is unlikely in light of the

Board's guidelines for bank loan expansion and the projected weakening of

1/ If M-1A and M-1B increase at a 9 percent in May-June, following
the projected April declines, the average second-quarter increase in
these aggregates would be only 2¼ and 3 percent, respectively; the
implied increase in velocity would be quite large--almost 6 percent.



-11-

economic activity. With the marginal reserve requirement on managed

liabilities also discouraging bank credit expansion, bank issuance of

large time deposits and other open market liabilities is expected to be

somewhat lower than in the first quarter. M-3 growth under alternative B

is projected at a 6½ percent annual rate over the March-June span,

considerably slower than in the first three months of the year.

(13) Growth in the aggregates at the rates specified under

alternative B implies an annual rate of growth from March to June of the

monetary base and of total reserves of about 4½ and 7½ percent, respectively.

On the assumption that member bank borrowings average around $1¾ billion

over the next few weeks and then decline to about $1¼ billion by mid-year,

nonborrowed reserves would increase at about a 20 percent annual rate over

the March-June period.1/ We have not made any special assumption about the

level of borrowing under the new temporary seasonal credit program. Such

borrowing as it develops would be considered to be economically equivalent

to nonborrowed reserves and therefore the nonborrowed reserve path would be

automatically adjusted to offset fluctuations in such credit.

(14) Market participants appear already to have discounted some

near-term decline in the funds rate associated with a cyclical turn in the

economy. If the funds rate did drop to the 16 to 17 percent area, however,

some further declines in short-term rates might occur, probably accompanied

by further weakening of the dollar on exchange markets, unless foreign

central banks also eased their own monetary policies. Recent declines in

longer-term market rates, however, have been so sharp relative to short rates

1/ This assumes continuous emergency-type borrowing by one bank of $400
million or so, and a level of adjustment credit borrowing of about
$1.4 billion over the next four weeks, declining to $800-900 million
by mid-year. If the emergency-type borrowing declines, the rate of
growth of nonborrowed reserves would be even larger than the 20 percent
indicated.



-12-

that they probably would not drop any further. Actual behavior of longer-

term rates will depend in part on offerings in the Treasury's mid-May

refunding--when they will be replacing $1.7 billion of maturing coupon issues

and probably will raise a certain amount of new cash--as well as the eagerness

of corporations to take advantage of the lower bond rates. Mortgage rates

in any event are likely to edge off from their recent peaks in view of the

sharp recent drop in bond yields and the likelihood that thrifts will find

it a little easier to attract deposits.

(15) Alternative C calls for one-half percentage point less growth

in M-1A and M-1B, at an annual rate, over the December to June period relative

to alternative B. This would imply growth in M-1A over the two months of

May and June of about 7¾ percent, or more than 1½ percentage points less

than alternative B. The funds rate would probably be in the area of 18

percent in the weeks ahead, or perhaps a little lower. Shorter-term market

rates are likely to back up a bit under this alternative, as market

participants become more doubtful about the timing and amplitude of a

cyclical downturn in rates. However, any tendency for longer-term market

rates to rebound from their recent lower levels might be limited if the

relatively tight monetary policy stance is construed as increasing the odds

of controlling inflation and/or intensifying the recession. The dollar

probably would not weaken further on foreign exchange markets and might

strengthen a bit.

(16) As shown in the charts, alternative C implies that all of

the monetary aggregates would be below their midpoint paths by June. In

order to achieve the midpoint of the longer-run aggregates growth ranges

for all of 1980, the Committee would therefore have to adopt a policy in

the second half of the year designed to accelerate money growth somewhat.



-13-

Such a policy would add to the downward interest rate pressures likely to

occur in any event in reflection of the sharp reduction in real GNP that the

staff is projecting. The staff anticipates, for example, a federal funds

rate of around 13 to 14 percent for late 1980 under alternative B, and this

rate would have to be lower under alternative C.

(17) Alternative C would probably require growth in total

reserves at about a 4 percent annual rate. Assuming an initial level of

borrowings of around $2 billion, gradually declining over the quarter to

$1 to $11 billion, nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 16 percent

annual rate from March to June. This alternative, however, is more likely

to induce borrowing under the new temporary seasonal credit program, thereby

requiring a downward adjustment in the nonborrowed reserves path.

(18) Alternative A calls for more rapid growth in the monetary

aggregates than B and C, and entails almost an 11 percent annual rate of

increase in M-IA over the next two months. As indicated in the charts, M-1A

and M-1B would be somewhat above their long-run midpoint paths by June,

implying less rapid growth of the narrow money stock (and higher interest

rates) in the second half of 1980 than the other two alternatives.

(19) To achieve alternative A targets, total reserves might have

to expand at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the March to June period. Assuming

member bank borrowings of around $1 billion in the next few weeks, and

gradually declining over the quarter to $1 to $1¼ billion, nonborrowed

reserves would rise by a 22½ percent annual rate. Such growth of

reserves probably would be associated with a fairly substantial drop in the

federal funds rate in the intermeeting period, perhaps into the lower half

of the 12 to 19 percent range suggested for this alternative.



-14-

(20) Alternative A would be accompanied by further declines in

short-term market rates as market participants became more firmly convinced

that the System would not be putting a floor under interest rates. However,

questions may well be raised in markets about the consistency of a sharp

further drop in rates with last month's anti-inflation program, and these

concerns would tend to limit rate declines in longer-term markets. Nonethe-

less, conventional home mortgage rates would probably retrace a large part

of the sharp run-up of the last 60 days, as the further decline in short-term

rates strengthens thrift deposit inflows this quarter.



-15-

Directive language

(21) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at the March

meeting. The language continues to call for expansion of reserve aggregates

at a pace consistent with the desired rates of monetary growth over the

first half of 1980, provided that the federal funds rate on a weekly

average basis remains within a specified range. The specifications

adopted at the March meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth over the first half of 1980 at an

annual rate of [DEL: 4½] ____ percent for M-1A and [DEL: 5] _____ percent for

M-1B, [DEL: or somewhat less,] provided that in the period before the next

regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within

a range of [DEL: 13 to 20] ____ TO ____ percent. The Committee believes

that, TO BE consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 should grow

at an annual rate of about [DEL: 7¾] ____ percent over the first half and

[DEL: expansion of] THAT bank credit should [DEL: slow] GROW in the months ahead

to AT a pace compatible with growth over the year as a whole within

the range agreed upon.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 10 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions
of 6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. For column 11, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week
over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is an
average of contract interest rates on comitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column
16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in a bi-weekly auction for short-term forward
commitments for government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming
prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury secu-
rities financed by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over
the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. Weekly data
are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

Note: Monthly averages reflect prorated averages of Wednesday data for domestic chartered banks and averages of current
and previous month-end data for foreign-related institutions. Loans are adjusted to exclude domestic interbank
loans.

1/ Adjusted for loans sold to affiliates.
2/ Loans to foreigners include only loans to foreign business and foreign banks.
?/ As of December 31, 1978, total loans and investments were reduced by $0.1 billion. "Other securities" were in-

creased by $1.5 billion and total loans were reduced by $1.6 billion largely as the result of reclassifications of
certain tax-exempt obligations. Most of the loan reduction was in "other loans" not shown on table.

4/ As of December 31, 1978, business loans were increased by $600 million as a result of a $700 million upward
reclassification in loans sold outright offset in part by a $100 million decline due to balance sheet reclassifica-
tions.

5/ As of January 3, 1979 as the result of reclassifications, total loans and investments and total loans were increased
by $600 million. Business loans were increased by $400 million and real estate loans by $500 million. Nonbank
financial loans were reduced by $300 million.

6/ As of December 1, 1979, loans sold to affiliates and commercial and industrial loans sold were reduced $800 million
and $700 million respectively, due to corrections of two banks in New York City.
