MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Just after the December 17 FOMC meeting, the Desk's

posture in the reserves market remained unchanged, and federal funds

continued to trade around 4-1/2 percent. On December 20, the discount

rate was cut by one percentage point to 3-1/2 percent in response to

cumulating evidence that economic and financial conditions were pointing

to receding inflation pressures. The funds rate immediately fell to its

new expected level of 4 percent. Since then, the funds rate has aver-

aged 4.07 percent, incorporating rather mild year-end pressures. Along

with the discount rate cut, the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing was increased by $50 million to account for the emergence of a

50 basis point spread between the funds rate and the discount rate. At

the same time a partly offsetting downward technical adjustment of $25

million recognized the ongoing downtrend in seasonal borrowing in early

winter; another such adjustment was made later in the intermeeting

period, to bring the borrowing allowance to its current level of $75

million. In the last two complete maintenance periods, actual adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing ran above its allowance, as reserve short-

falls pushed up adjustment borrowing on settlement days. So far in the

current maintenance period, overall discount borrowing has retreated to

an average of $100 million, which has included about $25 million of

special situation borrowing at one small western bank.

(2) Immediately after the 50 basis point easing of the funds

rate, other short-term market rates fell about 30 basis points and long

rates somewhat less. The prime rate followed the discount rate down by

a full percentage point to 6-1/2 percent, but its spread to funding

costs still remains high relative to historical experience. Subse-

quently, market rates, especially in the intermediate- and longer-term



sectors, decreased further through the first week of January on percep-

tions of continuing economic weakness. The decline in the yield on 30-

year Treasury bonds, to a low of around 7-3/8 percent, also was spurred

by discussions of a possible curtailment of issuance of long-term Trea-

suries. Since the first week of the new year, however, interest rates

have firmed in response to what are seen as more upbeat prospects for

the economy and the fading of market expectations of near-term monetary

policy easing, as well as to heightened market concerns about outsized

fiscal stimulus. In addition, a flood of issuance of corporate, mort-

gage-backed, and agency debt has put upward pressure on intermediate-

and long-term rates. On balance, 3-month rates are down about 1/4 to

1/2 of a percentage point since the last FOMC meeting, and long rates

are about unchanged. At intermediate-term maturities, where the effects

of a cyclical rebound and fiscal stimulus might be expected to be most

pronounced, Treasury rates are up as much as 25 basis points. A con-

siderable stock market rally was touched off by the policy easing and

expectations of a more buoyant economy, with broad indexes up 7 to 11

percent. Aided by lower funding costs and better-than-expected fourth-

quarter earnings reports, bank stock prices rose around 15 percent.

(3) The dollar declined further on exchange markets in late

December, particularly against the German mark, following the Bundes-

bank's 1/2 percentage point increase in its official lending rates on

December 19 and the System's easing action the next day. In January,

however, the dollar rebounded sharply, except against the Japanese yen.

Incoming evidence suggesting to market participants that wage and price

pressures in Germany may be less than feared, combined with renewed

optimism on the U.S. economy, held out the prospect of some reversal in

the relative directions of monetary policies. These expectations were



-3-

reflected in movements in long-term interest rates: German bond rates

declined 15 basis points in January, even as U.S. bond rates reversed

their earlier decreases. Over the intermeeting period the dollar rose,

on balance, by 2 percent against the mark and by similar amounts against

the other currencies in the European Monetary System. Against the yen,

however, the dollar declined 2-1/2 percent; most of the movement fol-

lowed Desk sales on January 17

.against a back-

drop of growing friction over bilateral trade issues. On a weighted-

average basis, the dollar's exchange value rose by 1-1/4 percent over

the intermeeting period.

(4) Growth of the broader monetary aggregates receded in

December, and M3 expansion slipped further in January. Over the two

months, M2 grew at a 2-3/4 percent rate and M3 at a 1-1/4 percent rate,

close to FOMC specifications of 3 percent and 1-1/2 percent, respec-

tively, for the November to March period. 1 These two-month growth

rates, especially for M3, were held down in part by unusually large, but

transitory, declines around year-end, whose reversal by the latter part

of January was not fully reflected in the monthly average.2 Even

after allowing for these temporary distortions, however, growth of the

1. The money data presented in this document reflect the results of
the annual benchmark and seasonal review--discussed in Appendix A--and
should be treated as strictly confidential until their release to the
public, tentatively planned for February 13.

2. In the weeks of December 30 and January 6, money funds in M2 and
especially institution-only money funds recorded unusually large out-
flows on a not seasonally adjusted basis: these outflows were more
than offset by the week of January 20. In addition, demand deposits
on a not seasonally adjusted basis increased through the two weeks
ending January 6, and then decreased in the next two weeks, by un-
usually small amounts. The revised seasonal factors do not fully
smooth out the effects of these variations on monthly growth rates--
appropriately so in that these swings partly reflected atypical
economic incentives unrelated to regular seasonal patterns, such as
the effect on money funds of the jump in stock prices late last year.



broad aggregates remained sluggish, particularly in light of the sharp

declines in short-term rates in the fourth quarter. The additional

steepening of the yield curve and the continued stock market rally have

made the returns on longer-term bond and stock funds still more attrac-

tive relative to average returns on M2 balances. Moreover, steep reduc-

tions since mid-December in average offering rates on NOW accounts and

savings deposits (including MMDAs) likely have held down deposit growth

by limiting the impact that the policy easing has had in lowering the

average M2 opportunity cost with respect to short-term market rates.

(5) The liquid components of the aggregates nevertheless con-

tinued to expand briskly on balance over December and January, perhaps

in part because depositors shied away from locking in low returns on

small time deposits. M1 grew at a 12 percent average rate. An

accelerating outflow of small time deposits was the primary culprit

behind a decline in the nontransactions component of M2 over the two

months. Growth of M3 was depressed not only by the year-end outflows of

money funds but also by a more sizable decrease in large time deposits

at commercial banks. Bank credit expansion softened in December, owing

to renewed weakness in loans. A further slowing of bank credit growth

is suggested by data for the first three weeks of January, as acquisi-

tions of securities have nearly halted. At thrifts, the decline in

large time deposits has abated some since November, as total thrift

assets likely fell less steeply since RTC resolution activity remained

dormant.

3. Over December and January, the rapid growth of transaction
deposits and required reserves sustained average growth in total re-
serves at a 19 percent annual rate. Combined with currency expansion
at a 7-1/2 percent rate, the monetary base grew at an average pace of
10-3/4 percent over the two months.



(6) Growth in the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors ap-

pears to have slowed to a 3-3/4 percent rate in December, and very

partial evidence suggests weak growth again in January. The decelera-

tion has mainly reflected a reduced pace of federal borrowing. In

addition, sluggish spending and deleveraging by businesses and house-

holds seem to have depressed the growth of debt of nonfederal sectors

since November even below the anemic 2-3/4 percent pace of earlier in

the year. Heavy gross issuance in corporate bond and equity markets

largely has represented balance sheet restructurings and refinancings:

Businesses have shifted further away from short-term borrowing at banks

and from commercial paper, while refundings of callable bonds and re-

verse LBOs have become more common. For households, the stirring of

activity in the housing market and soaring refinancings do not yet seem

to have encouraged much faster net mortgage growth, and consumer credit

still seems to be trending lower, even with an apparent respite in

December. Indicators suggest a stabilization of credit availability,

but no significant easing. In the January survey of senior loan

officers, banks reported little change of lending terms and standards

since last October and quality spreads in open markets have remained

stable or narrowed some since the December FOMC meeting.

Alternative Long-Run Strategies

(7) As background for consideration of the annual ranges for

money and credit in 1992, the table on the following page presents three

alternative long-run strategies for monetary policy through 1996, to-

gether with the associated consequences for output, prices, and resource

utilization. The baseline path, strategy I, judgmentally extends the

greenbook forecast for 1992 and 1993 out through 1996; as in the basic

greenbook forecast, it assumes no fiscal stimulus package this year

except for the change in tax withholding schedules. Strategies II and

III posit somewhat tighter and easier monetary policies as indexed by M2

growth one percentage point below or above the baseline M2 path. The

alternative scenarios for output, prices, and unemployment were obtained

using simulations of the staff's econometric model of the U.S. economy

to establish deviations around the baseline.4

(8) In each of the strategies, M2 growth over 1992 remains

restrained relative to historical relationships with interest rates and

income embodied in the staff's standard money demand equation by the

same forces that have depressed M2 growth in recent years--constraints

on the availability of depository credit, disruption of depositor rela-

4. When compared with the long-run strategies presented in previous
bluebooks, this table assumes smaller interest sensitivities of both
real spending and money demand. Specifically, in view of the overhang
of commercial real estate, nonresidential construction is assumed to
follow a predetermined path, independent of interest rates. Also, given
the apparently anemic response of M2 to the recent large declines in
short-term interest rates and M2's opportunity cost--in part because of
induced shifts to capital market instruments whose yields have become
relatively more attractive--the opportunity-cost elasticity of M2 demand
is assumed to be one-half of its econometrically estimated value. With
respect to interest rates, the adjustment to the money demand elasticity
reinforces the adjustment to the spending elasticity, resulting in a
larger short-run response of interest rates to a change in M2 growth.
Despite the damped response of spending to interest rates, these larger
movements in interest rates produce more sizable near-term output
effects for a given change in M2 growth than in past simulations.



tionships caused by RTC resolution activity, shifts out of M2 instru-

ments to higher-yielding capital market instruments, and deleveraging.

By 1993, minimal further downward shifting in M2 demand is foreseen.

With earnings and capital positions substantially improved by then,

banks are assumed to compete more aggressively for both loans and

deposits. In addition, longer-term rates are projected to decline, at

some point cutting into incentives for shifting into capital market

instruments, and stronger balance sheets of households and businesses

are restored. In the final four years, growth of M2 moves into conform-

ity with what would be expected given the growth in nominal spending and

movements in interest rates. It is assumed that the downward shift in

M2 demand in the 1990 to 1992 period is not retraced through the fore-

cast horizon, but rather that the level of M2 velocity has shifted up.

one-half percentage point above potential real GDP growth. Although

short-term nominal rates are flat over the entire forecast interval,

real short-term interest rates rise from their current unsustainably low

level, helping to slow output. By the end of the simulation, real

short-term rates reach about 2 percent, their average level during the

1950s and 1960s. Output growth also is held down by a mildly contrac-

tionary overall fiscal position of federal, state and local governments.

With the unemployment rate declining but remaining above the estimated

5-3/4 percent natural rate for most of the period, inflation gradually

slows to around 2 percent in 1995 and 1996.

(10) The tighter policy of strategy II produces virtual price

stability during the forecast period. The reduced rate of M2 expansion

of this strategy raises nominal interest rates more quickly, thus push-

ing up real rates and putting upward pressure on the dollar's exchange

value. This strategy damps the recovery over the 1992-1994 period in

comparison with the baseline. As a slower rate of job creation keeps a

larger and more sustained gap between actual unemployment and the natu-

ral rate, inflation declines more steeply. Since the staff model does

not allow for credibility effects that may accompany the resolute pur-

suit of price stability, it is possible that this policy could put even

greater and prompter downward pressure on both inflation expectations

and actual inflation.

(11) Strategy III provides for a more vigorous recovery in

output and jobs. Although the output path associated with this strategy

remains somewhat subdued compared with the typical post-war recovery,

given the current degree of slack in the economy the strategy makes no

further progress in reducing inflation beyond the gains projected

through 1993. Indeed, inflation accelerates slightly in the last two



-10-

years shown, since the unemployment rate drops to below the natural rate

by late 1994. Later in the period, nominal income growth in excess of

M2 growth is associated with somewhat higher nominal interest rates than

are embodied in strategies I and II. Real short-term interest rates,

however, remain at a lower level than in strategy I, placing downward

pressure on the exchange value of the dollar.

(12) The next table presents inflation rates derived from two

different sets of simulations of the P* model, which has been augmented

with a variable capturing the relative price of oil.5  The simula-

tions use the same M2 growth rates as in the exercise above. The upper

panel shows simulation results based on the basic P* model, which uses

an historical average of velocity as an estimate of long-run equilibrium

velocity, V* 6 In these simulations, inflation slows substantially

under all three strategies to about a 2 percent rate in 1992. All of

the strategies virtually eliminate inflation by 1993, and the first two

produce price deflation thereafter. The predictions in the lower panel,

which allow for shifts in V*, are roughly similar to those presented in

the previous table.7  As in the earlier set of forecasts, strategies

I and II allow for a continuing disinflation over the whole period,

while strategy III permits the inflation process to reignite.

5. Because a fixed-weight GDP deflator is not yet available, the
simulation results have been translated from the GDP deflator now used
in the P* models to the CPI.

6. For a discussion of this model, see J. Hallman, R. Porter, and
D. Small, "Is the Price Level Tied to the M2 Monetary Aggregate in the
Long Run?," American Economic Review, (September, 1991), pp. 841-858.

7. The velocity shifts are equal in magnitude to the errors in the
staff's standard model of the demand for M2, as detailed in the footnote
to the table.

Long-Run Ranges

(13) The table below presents three alternative sets of

ranges for growth of money and credit over 1992. (Appendix B gives

the ranges and outcomes for money and debt growth since 1979.) Alter-

native I represents the provisional ranges selected by the Committee

last July, which are identical to those used in 1991. The staff projec-

tions for M2, M3, and debt all are in the lower halves of these ranges.

Alternative II allows for a tighter policy stance, lowering each of the

ranges 1/2 percentage point. This alternative could be interpreted as

according with the more restrictive longer-run strategy II of the pre-

vious section, which involves money growth 1 percentage point slower

than in the extended staff projection. Any of the alternatives would

accommodate strategy III, but the thrust of that easier strategy would

be particularly consistent with the 1/2-percentage-point increase in the

ranges that define alternative III. An optional targeting approach,

which involves linking this year's target ranges to last year's ranges

rather than to the actual outcomes, also is discussed in this section.

(14) The staff is projecting that 3-1/2 percent M2 growth in

1992 will be consistent with the 5 percent increase of nominal GDP in

the greenbook. The implied rise in velocity this year after no change

in 1991, shown in chart 1, reflects the different behavior of interest

rates expected for 1992. With nominal short-term interest rates assumed

essentially flat in the greenbook projection, opportunity costs would

widen substantially in 1992 given the aggressiveness with which institu-

tions are reducing deposit offering rates. The widening opportunity

costs and decreasing impetus provided by previous policy easings would

work to raise M2 velocity. By contrast, the sharp decline in oppor-

tunity costs in 1991 tended to hold down M2 velocity. The rise in

velocity in 1992 also embodies another downward shift of money demand,

similar in magnitude to that experienced last year. Bank credit

should remain subdued--reflecting continuing restraints on supply as

well as borrower preferences for longer-term debt and equity--and with

needs for funds limited, banks will continue to be relatively

below that projected by the standard staff M2 model and about 1/2
percentage points below the model with a yield-curve variable.

unaggressive in seeking to retain deposits. 9  Given the wide spreads

between rates on deposits and rates on other investments and on consumer

credit, households are facing conditions favoring the shifting of depos-

it funds into capital market instruments, the financing of expenditures

out of deposits, and the paydown of outstanding debt. The public's

demand for retail deposits probably also will be depressed again in 1992

by the activities of RTC and BIF, with the abrogation of deposit con-

tracts and other disruptions to business relationships involved in the

process of resolving thrifts and banks. Although depository credit is

anticipated to fall this year, the decline is projected to be less than

in 1991, reflecting some abatement in the shrinkage of the thrift

industry. As a consequence, M3 is projected to rise 2 percent during

1992, somewhat faster than the 1-1/4 percent increase registered last

year.

(15) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is ex-

pected to strengthen a little to 5-1/2 percent in 1992 from 4-3/4 per-

cent in 1991. All of the acceleration is due to faster growth of fed-

eral debt. Nonfederal debt growth, at 2-3/4 percent, is projected to

remain quite slow. Despite the anticipated pickup in spending, the wide

spreads between borrowing and deposit rates at intermediaries that are

restraining M2 relative to income also will be holding down debt. In

addition, both households and businesses are likely to remain cautious

in their use of debt in view of still-strained balance sheets, with

9. Although banks have sharply reduced rates on liquid deposits.
and further cuts are expected, depositors evidently find such accounts
to be relatively attractive compared with retail CDs. In addition,
the opportunity cost of holding demand deposits has fallen sharply.
and compensating balance requirements have risen as earnings credit
rates have declined. Consequently, the staff expects the growth of M2
to be concentrated in its liquid components, including M1, which is
projected to expand 11-3/4 percent during 1992. As shown in chart 2,
M1 velocity is projected to decline again this year. The monetary
base would rise 8 percent in 1992.

businesses offering sizable volumes of equity to reduce reliance on

borrowed funds. With state and local governmental units under fiscal

pressure, some may borrow to finance budget imbalances, but the sector

as a whole should continue to limit its borrowing. We do not anticipate

added restraint on credit supplies. The financial condition of many

banks has strengthened, but given the more stringent treatment of weak

depository institutions embodied in the new banking legislation and the

overhang of questionable assets at banks, any loosening of terms and

standards for credit in 1992 is likely to be modest. Continued weakness

in commercial real estate should keep life insurers and some other

intermediaries under pressure as well, affecting especially lower-rated

business borrowers with limited access to open markets for long-term

finance. The restrained growth of debt relative to spending, along with

a lengthening of debt maturities and refinancing at lower interest

rates, is expected to alleviate strains on the financial positions of

many households and businesses.

(16) As noted above, the staff projections for M2, M3, and

domestic nonfinancial debt all are in the lower portions of their pro-

visional 1992 or alternative I ranges, as shown in the table on page 13

and by the dots in charts 3 and 4. This configuration gives consider-

ably greater scope for reducing than for raising interest rates should

output or inflation deviate from the staff forecast, or should the

Committee desire a different outcome. Indeed, given the staff's

appraisal of spending propensities and money demand relationships,

attaining the midpoint of the M2 range later this year implies a need

for a prompt 3/4 percentage point easing in the federal funds rate,

which would be expected to boost nominal GDP growth in 1992 from 5 to

5-1/2 percent. Moreover, the provisional ranges provide considerable

room for additional money growth should velocity not increase as much as

projected by the staff. However, an even larger than projected short-

fall in money demand, prompted say by especially aggressive reductions

in deposit rates, might tend to breach the lower bound of the range

without necessarily signalling weakness in the economy.

(17) If the Committee were concerned about this outcome, it

might consider alternative II, which would reduce each of the ranges by

1/2 percentage point. In comparison with alternative I, this alter-

native would more nearly center expected growth of money and credit

within the ranges. This alternative would allow more leeway for policy

to be tightened, if necessary, during the year, and would emphasize the

Committee's commitment to price stability. A disadvantage of this

approach is that it may be seen as signalling a lack of concern with

weak money and sluggish economic growth last year and appear inconsis-

tent with the Federal Reserve's recent efforts to stimulate a resumption

of economic growth.

(18) Alternative III would raise each of the ranges by 1/2

percentage point. It would convey a Committee intention to make up for

some of the monetary shortfall last year in order to ensure a reasonably

vigorous economic recovery. This alternative would be most appropriate

if the Committee viewed the odds as still being tilted toward weaker

economic performance than desired, or wanted appreciably more growth of

nominal GDP growth in 1992 and 1993 than in the greenbook. Moreover,

the higher range would allow for an abatement or even reversal of recent

money demand shifts, which would lower M2 velocity relative to the staff

forecast. With M2 expected to be only a little above the 3 percent

lower bound of its alternative III range by March, adopting this alter-

native would suggest a strong predilection towards a near-term easing of

monetary policy.



-17-

Tunnel Option

(19) Another option that the Committee might consider would be

to link target ranges for 1992 not to the actual outcome for 1991, but

to last year's target ranges. Such an approach would be most appropri-

ate if the Committee wanted to make up this year for last year's short-

fall in money growth from the midpoints of the ranges. One possibility,

depicted in chart 5, would set growth "tunnels," starting from the upper

and lower ends of the 1991 ranges. The boundaries of the tunnels in

this chart were constructed to represent growth at the midpoint of the

provisional ranges--4-1/2 percent for M2 and 3 percent for M3. Both of

the monetary aggregates currently are near the lower bounds of their

respective tunnels. For M2 to finish 1992 at the midpoint of the range

depicted in chart 5, the aggregate would need to expand about 6 percent

over the year--about 1-1/2 percentage points to make up last year's

shortfall from the midpoint plus the 4-1/2 percent growth consistent

with expansion in the middle of the new tunnel. If the staff's assess-

ment of money demand and underlying economic conditions is about right,

such an outcome would require a substantial easing of reserve conditions

early this year. The tunnel could be tilted downwards by selecting a

lower growth rate; such an adjustment might better convey the Federal

Reserve's continued commitment to the eventual achievement of price

stability, but it probably would still require a marked easing of

policy.

(20) Choice of tunnels carries a presumption of a multiyear

strategy for monetary growth. In the past, this approach has been

suggested as an element in a strategy that precommits money growth to

relatively narrow ranges over many years. Such a strategy implies

confidence that the targeted monetary aggregates and ultimate variables

of interest to the Committee--such as prices or nominal GDP--move fairly

closely together over the intermediate as well as long term. Under

these conditions, making up shortfalls or overshoots in money from

targets within a year or so would avoid inadvertent drift in the base

for annual target ranges, better providing a nominal anchor to ensure

the achievement and maintenance of the Committee's price objectives over

time. Choice of this approach in 1992 would be appropriate if last

year's shortfall in M2 were seen as associated with an undesirable

shortfall of income or transitory shifts in the demand for money. This

approach would be less attractive if there were concerns that money and

the ultimate targets of the Committee did not always reliably move

together, either because of appreciable interest elasticities of money

demand or shifts in such demands. Reflecting these features of money

demand, in the mid and late 1980s money growth well above the midpoints

for a series of years and then well below was consistent with relatively

damped variations in growth of nominal GDP. In the current situation,

as financial flows are being redirected away from depository institu-

tions, the relationship between spending and the liabilities of those

institutions, which make up the bulk of M2 and M3, might be seen as

remaining especially uncertain.



-19-

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(21) Two short-run policy alternatives are presented below for

Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would con-

tinue to trade around 4 percent, with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing

averaging around $100 million.10 Under alternative A, the federal

funds rate would decline to the 3-1/2 percent area in association with a

reduction of the borrowing allowance to $50 million.

(22) Projected monetary growth under the two alternatives is

presented below. Under both alternatives, growth in M2 would strengthen

a little over February and March from its December-January pace. Still,

growth in M2 would be fairly sluggish, despite the sharp decline in

money market rates near the end of last year; indeed, M2 velocity likely

would move higher in the first quarter under both alternatives, as hold-

ers of M2, responding in part to large declines in offering rates on M2,

continue to shift into capital market instruments and to restrain expan-

sion of balance sheets overall. M2 would remain in the lower half of

its provisional 1992 range through March under both alternatives, but

under alternative A would be on a trajectory to move up in its range

over the second quarter. An expected resumption of RTC resolution

activity would reappear as a drag on M2 late in the current quarter and

would have an even greater effect on M3. Partly as a consequence, M3

would remain in the lower half of its provisional range. In contrast,

M1 is expected to continue to expand at a double-digit pace, propelled

by further large gains in transaction deposits.

10. Another technical upward adjustment to the borrowing specifica-
tion might be called for in March to accommodate rising demands for
seasonal credit. However, there is more uncertainty than usual about
the extent of any pickup in view of the System's new floating-rate
seasonal credit program; this program reduces the interest-rate incen-
tive for banks to favor the seasonal program over other sources of
funds.

(23) The markets appear to have built in no policy moves in

the period just ahead and thus unchanged reserve market conditions

under alternative B should have no effect on interest rates. The

course of interest rates thus will depend on developments in fiscal

policy and the economy. In the former area, investors will be assess-

ing the implications of emerging agreements for the longer-term fiscal

outlook. Interest rates could move lower should incoming economic

indicators, as in the staff economic forecast, continue to point to a

flat economy in the near-term and further gains on inflation. If

rates were to edge down, the dollar might come under some downward

pressure, but it is not expected to change significantly under this

alternative.

(24) Short-term interest rates would fall by nearly the

50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate under alternative A.

With the funds rate around or perhaps a little below most assessments

of the underlying inflation rate, market participants might see such a

policy move as unsustainable, thereby limiting the decline in bond

rates. The greater prospects for calls on corporate bonds and prepay-

ments on mortgages would tend to widen spreads on such instruments

relative to Treasury yields. The exchange value of the dollar would

fall under this alternative as U.S. money market interest rates drop-

ped still further below those of our major trading partners.

(25) Even with a pickup over February and March, M2 would

expand at only a 3 percent annual rate over the December-to-March

period under alternative B, below the pace over the last three months

of 1991. All of the growth in M2 over coming months would come from

the 14-1/4 percent rate of expansion projected in its M1 compo-

nent. 1 1 Small denomination time deposits are seen as continuing to

run off rapidly over the remainder of the quarter. Recent aggressive

cuts in rates on liquid deposits, however, will tend to limit the

bulge in such accounts, deflecting some funds outside M2 as well as to

other M2 components. 12 Under the easier conditions of alternative

A, M2 would be expected to be expanding at a percentage point faster

pace in March and into the next quarter; all of the added growth in M2

would occur in M1, other liquid deposits, and M2 money funds.

(26) M3, under alternative B, would expand at only a 2 per-

cent annual rate over February and March, after even slower growth in

December and January. Acting to buoy M3, in addition to the February-

March pickup in M2, should be further inflows to institution-only

money funds, which have managed to damp the decline in their returns

relative to short-term market rates by extending maturities. However,

sluggish expansion in bank credit and an increase in RTC activity over

the quarter will continue to restrain this aggregate. Under alterna-

tive A, growth in M3 would strengthen slightly more, to a 2-1/2 per-

cent pace. Under either alternative, activity in bond and mortgage

markets would remain brisk. However, such activity will continue to

11. The expected strength in transactions components results in
projected growth in required and total reserves at annual rates of
about 17-1/2 percent from December to March, while the monetary base
would expand at a 10-1/2 percent rate.

12. Contacts with certain banks that recently had slashed rates on
such deposits, though, indicate that they envision only minor effects
on balances of longstanding customers.

be directed mostly toward reducing borrowing costs by calling or

refinancing existing debt. Indeed, businesses are expected to pay

down debt again in the first quarter as capital spending remains weak

and equity issuance strong. Although home mortgage borrowing is

expected to firm in response to the reduced loan rates and some pickup

in housing activity, household debt growth is expected to stay anemic

as consumer loans contract. Overall debt growth, at a 3-3/4 percent

rate from the fourth quarter of 1991 to March, will be boosted by

faster growth in federal debt than in December and January. However,

such growth would leave this aggregate below the lower end of its

monitoring range.



-24-

Directive Language

(27) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

language relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1992 and to the

operating paragraph for the intermeeting period.

1992 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee at THIS [DEL: its] meeting

ESTABLISHED [DEL: in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established

in February] for growth of M2 and M3 of ___ TO ____ [DEL: 2-1/2 to

6-1/2] percent and ____ TO ____ [DEL: 1 to 5] percent, respectively,

measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 [DEL: 1990] to the fourth

quarter of 1992 [DEL: 1991]. The monitoring range for growth of

total domestic nonfinancial debt [DEL: also] was SET [DEL: maintained] at

____ TO ____ [DEL: 4-1/2 to 8-1/2] percent for the year. [DEL: For 1992, on a

tentative basis, the Committee agreed in July to use the same

ranges as in 1994 for growth in each of the monetary

agregates and debt-, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991

to the fourth quarter of 1992.] With regard to M3, the

Committee anticipated that the ongoing restructuring of

thrift depository institutions would continue to depress the

growth of this aggregate relative to spending and total

credit. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will

continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward

price level stability, movements in their velocities, and

developments in the economy and financial markets.



-25-

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SLIGHTLY/main-

tain/INCREASE SLIGHTLY the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, (SOMEWHAT) slightly

greater reserve restraint might (WOULD) or somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint (MIGHT) would be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth

of M2 and M3 over the period from DECEMBER November through

March at annual rates of about _ AND _ [DEL: 3 and 1-1/2] percent,

respectively.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate
the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. The
attached tables compare growth rates of the old and revised series.
These data should be regarded as strictly confidential until their
release to the public, tentatively planned for February 13.

Benchmark Revisions

Data for the monetary aggregates have been benchmarked using
call reports through September 1991 and other sources. The benchmark
revisions boosted the growth rate of M2 by nearly 1/2 percentage point
over 1991, but had no effect on the annual growth rate of M3.

The benchmark incorporates corrections for the previous mis-
reporting of brokered time deposits by several large banks. Previ-
ously, these deposits had been misclassified as large time deposits,
rather than as small time deposits. The reclassification of these
deposits boosted both the level and growth rate of M2 in 1991, without
affecting M3 as a whole. The benchmark also resulted in substantial
upward revisions to IRA/Keogh accounts at credit unions since mid-
1990. Because these accounts are netted out of small time deposits,
the effect was to lower non-M1 M2; however, this effect was more than
offset by upward revisions in other components of M2. In addition,
there were some other minor downward revisions to non-M2 M3.

Seasonal Factor Revisions

Seasonal factors for the monetary aggregates have been
revised using the X-11 ARIMA procedure applied to data through prelim-
inary estimates for January 1992. Owing to changes in the deposit
reports (FR2900) effective September 17, 1991, the series for savings
deposits and MMDAs have been combined. To be consistent with our
previous seasonal adjustment procedure, seasonal factors for this
combined series, beginning with January 1990, have been derived from
data aggregated over banks and thrifts. Up to December 1989, each of
the four series--savings deposits at banks, savings deposits at
thrifts, MMDAs at banks and MMDAs at thrifts--continues to be season-
ally adjusted individually. Through that date, the four adjusted bank
and thrift series are then summed to yield the seasonally adjusted
total savings deposits and MMDAs.

Overall, the revisions to seasonal factors had little effect
on the broad pattern of growth during 1991, though some growth was
redistributed from the first half to the second half of the year. For
example, on a second-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, the revised
seasonal factors raised M1 growth by 0.5 percent, M2 growth by 0.3
percent, and M3 growth by 0.4 percent, while the growth rates over the
first half of 1991 were reduced by like amounts.

n.s.--not specified.
1. Targets are for bank credit before 1983: from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial
sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2
percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New York State would
slow MI growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was noted that ATS/NOW shifts
would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus, the longer-run range for M1 was
modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in
1981. M1-B was relabeled Ml in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent
in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent): in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to
5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have
only a limited effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered
other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these
accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-A growth and increased M1-B growth each
by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.
5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into other
checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in
1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2
and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average level
through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983 meeting
the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for Ml of 4 to 8 percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985 meeting
the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
11. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity
to economic and financial circumstances.
12. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
