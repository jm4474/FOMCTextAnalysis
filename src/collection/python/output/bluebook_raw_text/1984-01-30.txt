Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments 1

(1) M2 and M3 expanded at annual rates of about 7-1/4 and

8-1/4 percent, respectively, on average over December and January, based

on preliminary estimates for January. Growth of M2 was somewhat below,

and M3 a bit above, the 8 percent November-to-March paths specified by the

FOMC last month. Expansion of the broad aggregates was bolstered by a

pick-up in M1 growth from the reduced pace of late summer and autumn to

about an 8-1/4 percent annual rate over the two-month period--a more rapid

pace so far than the 6 percent November-to-March rate specified by the

Committee. This accelerated growth in M1 partially offset, in terms of

effects on M2 and M3, a marked slowing in growth of the nontransactions

components of these broad aggregates.

(2) Growth in the monetary and credit aggregates in 1983

relative to FOMC longer-run ranges for the period are shown in the table

below. Annual benchmark and seasonal revisions have raised growth rates

and redistributed growth during the year--in the case of M1 from the

first half of the year into the second half.

1. All money stock data presented in the bluebook incorporate annual
seasonal and benchmark revisions and, for M3, a definitional change
to include term Eurodollars. Impacts of these revisions on money
growth outcomes in 1983 relative to long-run targets are shown in
the table on page 2. More detail on the revisions is presented in
Appendix I. The revised data are STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL until their
official release.

2. Only about one-tenth of a percentage point of the revision reflects

(3) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors in December,

as in November, was above its average pace over the first three quarters of

the year. Treasury borrowing, however, was at a slower pace, reflecting in

part the timing of auctions in relation to year-end holidays. Consumer

credit growth has advanced in recent months with stepped-up purchases of

durables, especially automobiles, while financing needs of corporations rose

as expansion in fixed investment and inventory accumulation evidently out-

stripped growth in internally generated funds. In December, bank credit

growth was near the very brisk November pace, reflecting a further pick-

up in loans, led by the business and consumer categories, and financed in

part by a deceleration of security acquisitions.

(4) Nonborrowed reserves expanded modestly in December and January

on average, but showed more growth than total reserves as the average level

of borrowing dropped somewhat. Excluding the $1.3 billion that was borrowed

in the year-end statement week, borrowing has averaged virtually $650 million

since the last Comittee meeting. The monetary base over the past two months

has increased at about a 10-1/2 percent annual rate, boosted in January by

accelerated currency growth.



-4-

(5) The federal funds rate has averaged close to 9-1/2 percent

over the intermeeting period, little different from the weeks just prior

to the last FOMC meeting. Other market rates, however, have moved somewhat

lower, as the market responded to signs of a slowing in economic expansion

relative to expectations and, in the case of short rates, an unwinding of

mid-December tax date pressures. Private short-term rates are off about

50 to 70 basis points, and corporate and municipal bond yields are down about

60 basis points. Treasury yields also dropped, though by substantially less.

(6) The dollar has appreciated by about 1-1/4 percent on a weighted

average basis since the last FOMC meeting, advancing mainly against Euro-

pean currencies while edging down against the yen. The dollar is currently

only slightly below record peaks reached earlier in January.

the United States sold

$143 million, intervening on two days during the period. Exchange markets

seemed particularly thin and volatile in early January reflecting, among

other things, considerable uncertainty over the near-term pace of economic

activity in the United States and the accompanying interest rate outlook.

Long-run ranges

(7) The previous bluebook discussed issues that might be con-

sidered in establishing long-run ranges for the monetary aggregates and

credit for 1984--including consistency with continued economic recovery and

progress toward reasonable price stability, the outlook for a return to

more predictable velocity patterns, particularly for M1, and factors influ-

encing credit growth. This bluebook presents three alternative sets of

longer-term growth ranges for the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth

quarter of 1984 for Committee consideration, and discusses in general terms

possible implications for the economy. The set of ranges announced by the

Committee last July as its tentative choices for 1984 are shown below as

alternative II. Alternative I contemplates somewhat less rapid growth in

money and credit, while alternative III--which continues the ranges set for

1983 into 1984--would allow for more rapid growth in the aggregates.

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III

M1 4 to 7 4 to 8 5 to 9

M2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 7 to 10

M3 6 to 9 6 to 9 6-1/2 to 9-1/2

Debt 8 to 11 8 to 11 8-1/2 to 11-1/2

(8) Alternative II includes growth ranges for the broad aggre-

gates and credit that are 1/2 point lower than last year's ranges, and a

range for M1 that is one point lower than the range adopted for the second

half of last year. The 1/2 point reduction in the range for M2 may not

represent an "effective" reduction, since last year's range had allowed

for some residual shifting into MMDAs from assets outside M2--on the order

of 1/2 to 1 percentage point at an annual rate, which is close to what

actually developed, as nearly as can be estimated. On that reasoning,



the Committee could consider whether to reduce the M2 range for 1984 by one

percentage point from 1983 (rather than 1/2 point) so as to be more consist-

ent with the effective reduction embodied in the other ranges shown in

alternative II. That would make the M2 range under alternative II 6 to

9 percent, the same as for M3.

(9) The staff's GNP projection for 1984 assumes growth in the

money and credit aggregates generally in the upper half of the alternative

II ranges (though in the case of M2 right around the midpoint of a 6-1/2 to

9-1/2 percent range). Such outcomes would represent a deceleration of -

actual growth rates of the monetary aggregates in 1984 from their rates for

1983 as a whole, though the slowing, if any, would be much less marked for M1

and M2 when comparisons are made with growth in 1983 from their target base

periods. Credit growth in 1984 is expected to be close to the 10-1/2

percent pace of 1983.

(10) The staff anticipates that the behavior of money demand in

1984 will be roughly in conformance with historic norms, and that the veloci-

ties of the various aggregates will post moderate further increases, partly

induced by an updrift of interest rates over the course of this year that

is currently projected by the staff in the context of a rising structural

budget deficit. Of course, projections of the behavior of the aggregates,

not to mention projections of interest rates, remain uncertain. Nonetheless,

the pickup in M1 velocity over recent quarters is suggestive of the emergence

of somewhat more predictable behavior patterns for that aggregate. The

growth in velocity of M1 for 1984, given the projected growth in nominal GNP

of around 9 percent, would probably be on the order of 2-1/2 to 3 percent.

In the second year of economic expansions since the early 1950s V1 has in-

creased on average by about 3 percent (some of which reflects the impact of

cyclical interest rate increases).



-7-

(11) The expected relationship between M2 and M3 next year may

differ a bit from past patterns. Since the beginning of the 1970s, M3 has

for the most part tended to grow a little more rapidly than M2. In 1984,

there is more of a possibility that M3 growth may be about the same as M2

growth--given the expanded capacity of institutions to offer market interest

rates on assets included in M2 and the likelihood that a substantial portion

of bank credit expansion will be funded through the Euro-dollar market (as an

aspect of large net inflows of funds from abroad that are the obverse of our

current account deficit) rather than through CDs issued in the U.S. In

addition, slower growth in mortgage credit should hold back thrift issuance

of large CDs.

(12) The specifications of alternative I would be consistent

with a policy that exerts somewhat more restraint on demands for goods

and services so as to provide greater assurance that inflationary pressures

will be kept in check over time. Slower growth in money and a better price

performance over 1984 and into 1985, through their impact on expectations,

could improve the price-output tradeoff in subsequent stages of the tran-

sition to price stability. As growth in M2 and M1 is restrained to rates

around the midpoints of the proposed 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 and 4 to 7 percent

ranges, respectively, interest rates would probably be subject to more

upward pressure this year than under alternative II. As those pressures

come sooner, the odds would be reduced that interest rates would need to

rise further in 1985 in association with continued deceleration in money

growth targets, and by then might well begin to decline. M3 growth in this

alternative may be little different than under alternative II as institu-

tions attempt to sustain credit expansion by issuing more large-denomination

time deposits, partly to finance a shift in business credit demands from



-8-

bond markets to banks under conditions of temporarily rising long-term

rates.

(13) The more rapid growth of the aggregates contemplated by

Alternative III may not involve any rise of short-term interest rates over

the course of next year, but at the risk of being more accommodative to

upward price pressures. In that process, the trade-off between output

and price changes, for any given money growth, would begin to deteriorate

if inflationary expectations worsened. Such expectational effects might

tend to push longer-term rates up as the year progressed, and involve

higher short-term rates in 1985 in the process of restraining inflation

over time.

(14) The preceding analysis of all of the alternatives assumed

that underlying demands for goods and services would be about as strong as

as in the staff's GNP forecast. Should such demands prove to be substan-

tially weaker, growth of M1 might tend to be substantially stronger than

indicated--given M2 growth around, say, the middle of the alternative II

range--as falling market interest rates increase the demand for transactions

accounts, especially fixed ceiling rate NOW accounts. In such a case, M1

growth toward the upper end of its alternative III range could evolve.

This would be similar to the experience with M1 in the last half of 1982

and early 1983, and would be a consequence of a greater interest elasticity

for M1 demand under current institutional conditions than for M2. A sym-

metrical argument might be made if demands for goods and services proved to

be substantially stronger than now anticipated--leading to the possibility of

reduced M1 growth well below the top of its alternative I range in face of a

marked rise in interest rates, although this effect could be muted by shifts

of funds into super-NOW accounts from fixed-ceiling NOW accounts and demand

deposits.

Prospective developments

(15) The table below shows alternative specifications for the

growth of the monetary aggregates for the November-to-March period, the

interval used by the Committee in setting monetary growth rates at its

December meeting; more detailed data are shown on the table and charts on

ensuing pages. The associated federal funds rate ranges for the upcoming

intermeeting period and implied growth rates for the aggregates from

January to March are presented in the lower panels of the table. The speci-

fications of alternative B retain the growth rate for the broad aggregates

chosen by the Committee at its last meeting; however, they also include a

somewhat higher growth for M1 in light of recent experience with the relation-

ship between the narrow and broader aggregates. Alternative A calls for more

rapid money growth, and alternative C involves slower growth, with M1 growing

at the rate specified at the previous meeting.

involve little change in money market conditions over the intermeeting

period, would bring M2 growth to the middle of its alternative II range by

March, with M1 in the upper part of its range. M1 growth would be expected

to moderate in February and March from the relatively rapid average pace

of December and January, to about a 5 percent annual rate. On a quarterly

average basis, M1 expansion in the first quarter would be around 7-1/4 per-

cent, implying growth in velocity of around 2-1/2 percent, given projected

first-quarter nominal GNP growth. Such a velocity rise would be somewhat

less than in the fourth quarter--which was about 3-1/2 percent--and roughly

in line with predictions of the money demand equations in the Board's

quarterly and monthly models. While M1 growth may slow over the next two

months, growth in the nontransactions component of M2 is expected to pick up

from its depressed January pace and be more in line with growth in income,

thereby sustaining M2 growth at around an 8 percent annual rate.

(17) Borrowing at the discount window under alternative B would

be expected to range around $650 million, and federal funds to remain in

the 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent area. However, with contemporaneous reserve

requirements being instituted on February 2, reserve paths will have to

take account of transitional and more permanent adaptations by banks in their

reserve management strategies that could affect, among other things, patterns

of borrowing and excess reserves. Reserve paths in the initial stage of CRR

implementation would probably need to allow for higher than average excess

reserves. By March, however, excess reserves may be closer to "normal," and

on that assumption growth in total reserves over the next two months is

likely to be around 5 percent under alternative B. Nonborrowed reserve

growth, assuming borrowing settles down around $650 million, would increase

at a 6 percent annual rate.

(18) Interest rates under alternative B would be expected to

fluctuate in a narrow range around current levels over the intermeeting



-12-

period. The recent drop in short and long-term rates is not likely to carry

further, given the continued growth expected in the monetary aggregates and

expansion in credit demands at slightly more than the fourth-quarter pace.

Treasury credit demands are likely to be larger this quarter than in the

fourth, offsetting some tendency for private borrowing to slow. State and

local government bond issuance is expected to be at a relatively reduced

pace, given the legislative uncertainty about the status of some types of

revenue bonds. The increase in household mortgage and consumer installment

debt also is likely to moderate along with the slower growth of consumer

durables purchases and the relatively flat pattern of housing starts and

expenditures. Corporate borrowing, on the other hand, may be greater than

in the fourth quarter as internal fund generation levels off while spending

for capital and inventories continues to rise.

(19) The less rapid growth of money under alternative C, though

still leaving the aggregates well within the alternative II longer-run

range by March, would also be consistent with the slower annual growth

rates of longer-run alternative I. The November-to-March growth rates

of 7-1/2 and 6 percent for M2 and M1, respectively, contemplated by this

alternative would bring these aggregates to levels just above the mid-

points of the alternative I ranges by March. Such growth rates would

probably entail somewhat greater restraint on reserve positions over the

weeks ahead, with borrowing rising to the neighborhood of $1 billion.

Nonborrowed reserves might contract slightly over the next two months.

(20) A funds rate of around 10 percent might evolve from these

reserve conditions. Because market expectations of higher rates have be-

come more muted in recent weeks, interest rates generally would also rise

rather sharply, although interpretations of developments by market partici-

pants might for a time be made more difficult by uncertainties in connection



-13-

with CRR. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might move up to the area of 9-1/2

percent, bank CD rates to around 10 percent, and the dollar would rise

further on foreign exchange markets. The tendency for bond yields to rise

might be moderated--especially once the forthcoming Treasury refunding

is distributed--as corporate bond offerings fall off and if expectations

of a weakening in economic activity become more pervasive.

(21) The more rapid growth of money under alternative A would

bring M1 near the upper limit of, and M2 into the upper part of, their

respective alternative II longer-run ranges. In that sense alternative

A may be more consistent with the more expansive longer-run growth rates

of alternative III.

(22) Expansion of M1 and M2 at annual rates of 6-1/2 and 9-1/4

percent, respectively, from January to March, as contemplated by A, would

probably involve a decline of interest rates over the next few weeks as

borrowing at the discount window dropped to an average of around S400

million and nonborrowed reserve growth accelerated to about a 12 percent

annual rate for the January to March period. The funds rate would drop to

9 percent or a little lower, and other short-term rates would fall by com-

parable amounts, with the Treasury bill rates moving to below 8-1/2 percent;

and the dollar would decline-perhaps sharply--on foreign exchange markets.

Such an easing of money market conditions would likely also set off a sub-

stantial rally in bond and stock markets, though a rally that could be

reversed if market participants concluded that greater inflationary

pressures would become more likely.



-14-

Directive language

(23) Given below are two alternative approaches to the directive

paragraphs that specify the long-run ranges for 1984 and the objectives for

operations over the intermeeting period. The first alternative retains the

present degree of emphasis on M1, while the second is suggested should the

Committee wish to place additional weight on that aggregate.

Alternative 1 (No change in M1 emphasis)

The proposed language related to the long-term ranges is presented

in paragraphs (a) and (b) and language related to operations is shown in

paragraph (c). Paragraph (a) presents the long-run targets in the same

order and with essentially the same language as in the current directive.

The qualifying language in the current directive about the relationship of

the aggregates to economic goals is shown in brackets at the end of para-

graph (a)--with suggested modifications indicated--should the Committee still

wish to emphasize particular uncertainties in that respect. Paragraph (b),

taken without change from the present directive, indicates weights to the

given to the various aggregates and other factors in policy implementation.

Proposed Language for Long-term Ranges

(a) The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary

and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a

sustainable pattern of international transactions. In furtherance

of these objectives the Committee established growth ranges for

the broader aggregates of ____ to ____ percent for M2 and ____ to ____

percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the

fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee considered that growth of M1

in a range of ____ to ____ percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to



-15-

the fourth quarter of 1984 would be consistent with the ranges

for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total

domestic nonfinancial debt was set at ____ to ____ percent for

1984. [The Committee recognized that the relationships between

such ranges and ultimate economic goals MAY have become less

predictable; that the impact of {DEL: new] DEREGULATED deposit

accounts on [DEL: growth] ONGOING BEHAVIOR of monetary aggregates

cannot YET be determined with a high degree of confidence; and

that the availability of interest on large portions of transac-

tion accounts may be reflected in some changes in the historical

trends in velocity.]

(b) In implementing monetary policy, the Committee

agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on

the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior

of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt would be monitored,

with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on

evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predict-

able patterns. The Comittee understood that policy implementation

would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between

the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, includ-

ing evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign

exchange markets.

Proposed Operational Paragraph

(c) The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain

at least (or MAINTAIN/INCREASE SLIGHTLY/DECREASE SLIGHTLY) the

existing degree of reserve restraint, TAKING ACCOUNT OF EFFECTS

OF THE SHIFT TO THE CONTEMPORANEOUS RESERVE REQUIREMENT SYSTEM,



-16-

PARTICULARLY IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION,

ON RESERVE MANAGEMENT BY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. The action is

is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual

rates of around [DEL: 8]____ AND ____ percent RESPECTIVELY from November to

March. The Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual

rate of around [DEL: 6] ____ percent from November to March will be

consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates, and

that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt WILL BE

WITHIN THE RANGE ESTABLISHED FOR THE YEAR [DEL: would continue at

around its recent pace]. Depending on evidence about the con-

tinuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing

on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint

would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly

WHILE LESSER RESTRAINT MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF A

SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL IN GROWTH OF THE AGGREGATES FROM CURRENT

EXPECTATIONS. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation

if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit

of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the

period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with

a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 6 to

10] ____ TO ____ percent.

Alternative 2 (Increased emphasis on M1)

Paragraphs (d) and (e) below present alternative language that

would give more emphasis to M1 as a long-run target, while paragraph (f)

suggests conforming changes in the operational paragraph.



Proposed Language for Long-term Ranges

(d) The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster

monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce

inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable

basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international

transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee

established the following growth ranges for monetary and credit

aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the

fourth quarter of 1984: ____ to ____ percent for M1, ____ to

____ percent for M2, and ____ to ____ percent for M3. The associated

range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at ____ to ____

percent in 1984.

(e) In implementing monetary policy the Committee

agreed to increase somewhat the weight on M1 as behavior of its

velocity has recently been broadly consistent with historical

patterns. Still, uncertainties remain about the future behavior

of M1 velocity, in view of the substantial changes in the com-

position of M1 and the characteristics of deposits in this

aggregate; and the Committee will continue to place substantial

weight on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates and to

monitor expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt. In

general, the Committee understood that policy implementation

would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between

the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, in-

cluding evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign

exchange markets.

Proposed Operational Paragraph

(f) The Committee seeks in the short run to main-

tain at least (or MAINTAIN/INCREASE SLIGHTLY/DECREASE SLIGHTLY)

the existing degree of reserve restraint, TAKING ACCOUNT OF

EFFECTS OF THE SHIFT TO THE CONTEMPORANEOUS RESERVE REQUIRE-

MENT SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

ITS IMPLEMENTATION, ON RESERVE MANAGEMENT BY DEPOSITORY INSTITU-

TIONS. THE ACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH OF

Ml, M2, AND M3 AT ANNUAL RATES OF AROUND ____ PERCENT, ____ PERCENT,

AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH. EXPANSION

OF NONFINANCIAL DEBT IS EXPECTED TO BE WITHIN THE RANGE ESTAB-

LISHED FOR THE YEAR. Depending on evidence about the continuing

strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the

business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint

would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly

WHILE LESSER RESTRAINT MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF

A SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL IN GROWTH OF THE AGGREGATES FROM

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Opera-

tions that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related

reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persist-

Appendix I

Money Stock Revisions

Measures of the money stock have been revised to reflect annual

seasonal and benchmark revisions, as well as a definitional change affecting

M3. These revisions are preliminary and are to be regarded as strictly

confidential until their release. This appendix discusses the revisions and

presents tables comparing growth rates of the old series and estimates of the

new series (which should still be considered preliminary).

Definitional Change

The definition of M3 has been changed to include term Eurodollars

held by U.S. residents in Canada and the United Kingdom, and at foreign

branches of U.S. banks elsewhere. A recent reporting change provides data

on term Eurodollars at a panel of branches of large U.S. banks on a schedule

similar to other M3 elements. The inclusion of term Eurodollars raised the

level of M3 by about $90 billion but had a minimal effect on M3 growth in

1983.

Benchmark Revisions

Deposits have been benchmarked to recent call reports; further

revisions to deposits stem from changes to System reporting procedures

made in 1983, largely related to reduced reporting under the Garn-St Germain

Act of 1982. In addition, the currency component was revised to reflect

revisions to figures on the amount of coin in circulation. The net impact

of these revisions was to raise the levels and boost the growth rates of

each of the aggregates in 1983.

Seasonal Revisions

Seasonal factors have been updated using the X-ll ARIMA procedure

adopted in 1982. Nontransactions M2 has been seasonally adjusted as a



I-2

whole--instead of being built up from seasonally adjusted savings and

small time deposits--in order to reduce distortions caused by portfolio

shifts arising from financial change in recent years, especially shifts

to MMDAs in 1983. A similar procedure has been used to seasonally adjust

the non-M2 portion of M3.

The effects of revisions to seasonal adjustment factors on M1

growth are larger than average while those for M2 and M3 are more typical

of recent years. Seasonal revisions tended to boost growth in all of the

aggregates in the latter part of 1983.
