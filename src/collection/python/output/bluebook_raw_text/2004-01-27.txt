1  The effective federal funds rate averaged close to 1 percent over the intermeeting
period.  Futures market quotes apparently incorporated expectations for a slightly elevated
funds rate at year end.  In the event, the effective rate was 6 basis points below the target as
the result of the provision of ample reserves around the turn of the year.  Over the
intermeeting period, the Desk increased its outright holdings by $1.4 billion, entirely through
purchases of  Treasury bills from foreign official institutions.  The outstanding amount of
long-term RPs declined $7 billion to $14 billion along with the seasonal demand for reserves.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The FOMC’s decision at the December meeting to keep its target for the

federal funds rate at 1 percent came as no surprise to market participants, and interest

rate futures for the first half of this year were essentially unchanged after the

announcement.1   But futures rates for the second half rose several basis points,

presumably in response to the Committee’s assessment that the probability of an

unwelcome decline in inflation had fallen in recent months to a level almost equal to

that of a rise in inflation.2  Subsequently, however, the release of the minutes from the

October FOMC meeting, which indicated that at that time the Committee was

concerned about the possibility of persistent slack arising from rapid productivity

growth, and the publication of surprisingly modest growth in employment in

December led most market participants to push back the date of the expected onset

of tightening to the fall.  (See box entitled “Expectations for Monetary Policy.”)  That

effect was only partially offset by stronger-than-expected indicators of spending

Expectations for Monetary Policy

The inclusion of the “considerable period” language in the last four FOMC
statements has helped to anchor near-term policy expectations.  Indeed, near-term
futures rates have held close to 1 percent, and implied volatility over a four-month
horizon has remained at unusually low levels.  However, the estimated duration of
the period for which policy has been expected to remain on hold implied by
futures prices has varied considerably.  At the time of the last FOMC meeting, the
expected policy path turned higher after a few months, fully pricing in a 25 basis
point tightening by May of this year.  Futures rates now indicate that a full 25 basis
point tightening is not expected until October.  Similarly, the Desk’s most recent
survey of primary dealers found a median expectation for an initial rate increase in
the fourth quarter, although five of the twenty-two respondents predict a rise in
the target before mid-year.  That survey also indicated that about three-quarters of
the respondents expect the FOMC to keep the “considerable period” language in
the statement at the upcoming meeting.  

growth.  On net over the intermeeting period, interest rate futures fell as much as 60

basis points (Chart 1).  

(2) Reflecting the change in policy expectations, intermediate- and longer-

term nominal Treasury yields declined about 30 basis points over the intermeeting

period.  Yields on inflation-indexed debt fell somewhat less, suggesting that the drop

in nominal yields owed more to lower real interest rates than to reduced inflation

compensation.  Similarly, surveys of inflation expectations were little changed over the

intermeeting period.  Yields on higher-tier investment-grade corporate bonds moved

down about in line with similar-maturity Treasury yields, while lower-tier investment-

grade and speculative-grade yields fell a bit more (Chart 2).  Given the declines in

yields and optimism about the outlook for profits, major stock price indexes rose 

6-1/2 to 9 percent over the intermeeting period.

(3) Since the December FOMC meeting, the dollar has dropped more than

2-1/4 percent on balance versus the major foreign currencies (Chart 3).  The dollar’s

decline apparently owed in part to heightened concerns about financing the U.S.

current account deficit and the disappointing U.S. employment data for December,

although those downward pressures were offset for a time by investors’ reaction to

comments by European officials expressing discomfort with the pace of the

appreciation of the euro.  On balance, the dollar fell about 4 percent against the euro

over the period.  The dollar depreciated more sharply against the pound–about 6

percent–on a growing conviction among market participants that the Bank of England

would respond promptly to the quickening pace of U.K. economic activity.  The

dollar depreciated about 1 percent against the yen as the Bank of Japan purchased

dollars in substantial volume and late in the intermeeting period raised its target range

for bank reserves.3  The Bank of Canada cut its policy interest rate 25 basis points

following signs of deterioration in Canada’s trade position, Canadian longer-term

yields declined markedly, and the U.S. dollar ended the period about unchanged

against the Canadian dollar.  Yields on European long-term government debt declined

15 to 20 basis points over the intermeeting period, tracking yields on comparable

long-term Treasuries fairly closely.  Equity markets in major industrial countries

continued their recent upward trends, with stock prices gaining 4 to 8 percent.

(4) The dollar fell about 1 percent against an index of the currencies of our

other important trading partners.  Equity markets in most developing Asian

economies continued to advance, reflecting the global tech-sector revival and the

region’s robust economic recovery.  Capital inflows reportedly added to upward

pressure on exchange rates in many countries in the region, and the accumulation of

foreign official reserves continued apace.  Korean authorities took action to limit the

impact of such flows on the won with new restrictions on Korean institutions’

transactions in the non-deliverable forward currency market.  The dollar also recorded

a decline of about 2 percent against the Mexican peso as the Mexican industrial sector

showed signs of reviving and a 3-1/2 percent drop verus the Brazilian real as activity

in Brazil continued to recover.  EMBI+ spreads on both countries’ bonds narrowed

further.  

(5) With capital spending still modest and inventory accumulation only

beginning to revive, businesses have been able to meet their financing needs primarily

by relying on robust profits.  While the outstanding amount of corporate bonds was

little changed on net in December, commercial paper and C&I loans again posted

substantial declines (Chart 4).  For the nonfinancial business sector as a whole, debt

grew in the fourth quarter at a 2-1/4 percent rate.  Still, credit appears to be

increasingly available to businesses, at least as evidenced by the easing of standards

and terms on C&I loans reported in the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. 

In the household sector, interest rates on home mortgages declined over the

intermeeting period in line with other market rates and, even though refinancing

activity remained well below earlier last year, mortgage debt growth has been buoyed

by elevated borrowing to purchase homes.  Total household debt is estimated to have

expanded at nearly a 9-3/4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, about matching its third-

quarter advance.  Federal debt expanded at a 9 percent pace in the fourth quarter,

bringing the growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt to an estimated

7 percent annual rate.

monthly decline.4  M2 shrank at the same annual rate for the fourth quarter as a

whole, marking the largest contraction since the start of consistent data collection in

1959 and following on the heels of more than 7 percent growth over the first three

quarters of last year.  The weakness, which was concentrated in liquid deposits and, to

a lesser extent, in retail money market mutual funds, probably owed in large part to

the unwinding of mortgage refinancing effects and to portfolio shifts by households

into equities.  The slowdown in mortgage refinancing has slashed the amount of funds

being parked in M2 deposits pending disbursement to holders of mortgage-backed

securities.  In addition, with fewer cash-out refinancings, proceeds from prior

cash-outs that were held temporarily in M2 assets before being spent or invested

elsewhere were not replenished.  Furthermore, significant climbs in stock prices and a

sharp reduction in equity price volatility may have encouraged brisk inflows to equity

mutual funds late last year.  The staff estimates that refinancing and portfolio shifts

likely accounted for a 5 to 7 percentage point drag on M2 growth in the fourth

quarter. 



6

Policy Alternatives

(7) More accommodative financial conditions than expected over the

intermeeting period and a slight upward revision in estimated trend productivity

growth have led the staff to nudge up its projection of economic growth for later this

year and next year.  The Greenbook assumes that the Committee will commence

tightening policy in 2005 and gradually raise the funds rate to 2 percent by the end of

that year.  Longer-term corporate yields are projected to edge down as investors come

to expect a path for policy that is more in line with the trajectory assumed by the staff

and trim risk spreads as they see the economic expansion as more firmly established. 

Equity prices are expected to rise enough over the forecast interval to yield

risk-adjusted returns comparable to those on fixed-income instruments.  The dollar is

assumed to continue falling, but at a gentler pace than of late.  Given these supportive

financial conditions, output is projected to expand about 5-1/4 percent this year, but,

as fiscal policy shifts from substantial stimulus to mild restraint–related in part to the

expiration of investment incentives–and monetary accommodation lessens, economic

growth slows to about 4 percent in 2005.  Production grows faster than the expansion

of its potential, thereby closing the output gap and bringing the unemployment rate 

to its natural rate by the end of 2005.  Core PCE inflation maintains a pace of around

1 percent over this year and next.

(8) To examine strategies and risks for monetary policy beyond 2005, 

various scenarios were created with the aid of the FRB/US model of the economy. 

To preserve the central features of the staff forecast, judgmental adjustments were

made to the model in the period beyond of the Greenbook horizon.  On the supply

side, trend multifactor productivity is assumed to rise at around 1-3/4 percent

annually, while capital deepening picks up a little, implying a gradual rise in potential

output growth from 3-3/4 percent to around 4 percent in the latter part of the decade. 



7

The natural rate of unemployment remains about 5 percent.  As for aggregate

demand, households are expected gradually to return their saving rate closer to its

historical norm, putting some restraint on spending.  Working to offset some of this

restraint, the unified federal budget deficit is projected to rise to around 3 percent of

GDP, reflecting rapid growth of federal interest payments and transfers, and the

foreign exchange value of the dollar is anticipated to decline gradually in real terms,

capping the current account deficit as a share of GDP at 5 percent.  On net, according

to the FRB/US model, the equilibrium real funds rate is expected to rise gradually

over the rest of this decade to around 3 percent, a bit above its historical average.  

(9) The first set of scenarios examines the interplay of the Committee’s

long-run goal for inflation and its ability to hold policy at its currently accommodative

stance for a “considerable period.”  Chart 5 depicts an extension of the Greenbook

forecast in which inflation remains near 1 percent (the solid line) and two alternatives

in which policy is designed to keep core PCE inflation at 1/2 percent (the long dashed

line) or 1-1/2 percent (the dotted line) in the latter part of the decade.  With the staff

projecting that resource slack will be about eliminated and the economy growing at a

sustainable pace by the end of 2005, keeping inflation at 1 percent requires steadily

raising the nominal short-term policy rate to catch up to its more gradually rising

equilibrium value.  Throughout this extension of the Greenbook baseline, the

economy remains roughly in balance, with the unemployment rate holding near         

5 percent and core PCE inflation close to the assumed 1 percent longer-run goal. 

Bringing inflation down toward a long-run value of around 1/2 percent, in contrast,

could be consistent with initiating tightening in the second half of this year and

holding unemployment slightly above its natural rate for a few years.  Under the same

economic assumptions, policy tightening can be delayed until the second half of 2006

if the Committee desired to push inflation up to 1-1/2 percent in the long run.  In

the difference of the output gap from the baseline and 1-1/2 times the difference of the
four-quarter core PCE inflation rate from the baseline.

that case, the economy could grow at a pace above that of its potential for several

years, pulling the unemployment rate down to the neighborhood of 4-1/2 percent by

2007.

(10) Two additional scenarios were constructed to examine the policy

implications of temporarily higher productivity growth, on the one hand, and more

inflation pressures, on the other.  For these simulations, an alternative policy path was

constructed by assuming that monetary policy follows a Taylor rule so that the funds

rate moves in response to deviations of the output gap and the inflation rate from the

baseline extension in which the Committee has a long-run inflation goal of 1 percent.5 

In Chart 6, temporary gains in productivity are assumed to boost potential GDP

growth by nearly 3/4 percentage point over this year and next, relative to the baseline

projection, thereby putting downward pressure on the rate of inflation and pushing up

the rate of unemployment.  (This result is in contrast to the effects of a permanent

increase in the trend rate of productivity growth, which would strengthen aggregate

demand and raise the long-run equilibrium real funds rate because it significantly

boosts households’ wealth and sense of their permanent income.  These scenarios are

discussed in greater detail in the Greenbook.)  To offset the effects on inflation and

the output gap of the temporary productivity gains in this scenario, the Taylor rule

prescribes a slight cut in the funds rate this year, before reversing course next year. 

Still, inflation dips as low as 3/4 percent in 2006.

(11) In the “more inflation pressures” scenario (Chart 7), the decrease in

inflation observed over 2003 is attributed to a greater extent than in the Greenbook

baseline to temporary special factors.  Core PCE inflation is assumed to bounce back

to a 1-3/4 percent rate this year and to head higher in the absence of any adjustment

in the nominal federal funds rate.  To counter these pressures given an assumed

inflation goal of 1 percent, the Taylor rule calls for policy tightening to begin this year

so as to keep the real funds rate from falling (the dashed lines).  Although inflation

nevertheless picks up a little over the next two years, unemployment is held above its

natural rate for long enough to bring the inflation rate back toward the baseline result

of 1 percent toward the latter part of the decade. 

(12) With regard to the immediate choice of policy, if the Committee shares

and finds acceptable the staff outlook of a closing output gap and a stable 1 percent

core PCE inflation rate over the next two years, it might choose an unchanged

target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  The Committee might interpret the

recent strength in private spending, and particularly the rebound in manufacturing, as

signs that a more robust expansion is under way and that the threat of a pernicious

decline in inflation has receded further.  Although the Committee may continue to see

sizable odds on inflation edging lower, it may assign only modest cost to such an

outcome if associated with faster-than-expected productivity growth rather than with

unanticipated and potentially self-feeding weakness in aggregate demand.  With

economic growth rebounding and substantial monetary stimulus still in place, the

Committee may even view disinflation risks as about offset by the probability that

inflation pressures will be stronger than in the Greenbook.  But even if the Committee

believes that the next policy move will likely be a tightening, it might also judge that

the process need not begin at this meeting because of the current low inflation rate

and persistent resource slack.  In particular, it may still see the costs of an

accommodative policy stance as low in the current environment when weighed against

the benefits of possibly countering an unexpected weakening in the expansion of

private spending. 



10

(13) By contrast, if the Committee is concerned, in light of recent

unexpectedly soft inflation readings and weakness in the labor market, that economic

growth may not remain rapid enough to remove resource slack before inflation

declines significantly further, then it might choose to cut the target federal funds

rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Though incoming data have pointed to a

strengthening in private spending, the economic expansion may fail to gain traction if

business confidence is set back or consumer demand is eroded by continued sluggish

employment growth.  The lackluster demand for funds by businesses, continuing

contraction of M2 and bank credit, and higher energy prices may add to such

concerns.  Even if the economy expands as rapidly as predicted in the Greenbook, the

slowdown in actual productivity growth projected by the staff may fail to materialize,

implying further disinflation that, while not of the pernicious variety, may be

unwelcome.  Indeed, members may regard the prevailing rate of inflation as near the

bottom of a range that they view as desirable over the longer run and may wish to

implement a policy setting that reduces downside risks to growth while increasing the

scope for inflation to move up somewhat over time, such as depicted in the longer-

run scenario of Chart 5 in which the inflation goal is assumed to be 1-1/2 percent.

(14)  Abstracting from the current stance of its communications with the

public, the Committee might wish to consider a possible tightening of policy that

would begin to remove some of the prevailing substantial degree of monetary ease. 

The economy now seems to be growing robustly, and over the last two years the real

funds rate has been about zero, roughly around the lower edge of a range of estimated

equilibrium values of this rate (Chart 8).  Moreover, the Committee may put a high

probability on the emergence of stronger inflation pressures, similar to that envisioned

in many private sector forecasts.  Indeed, an early tightening could help restrain

inflation expectations, which remain above the current inflation rate.  Given the

11

Committee’s stated commitment to keep policy accommodative for a considerable

period, a tightening at this meeting may not be in the cards.  However, concerns that

inflation pressures could arise more quickly than generally expected might induce the

Committee to adjust its communications to better reflect its weighing of such

expectations for policy.

Policy Announcement, Directive, and Assessment of Risks.

(15) If the Committee believes that events are unfolding about as it had

expected in December, then it may want to adopt language in the rationale

paragraph of its announcement generally similar to that in the statement following

the last meeting (given in appendix A), with appropriate revisions to reflect recent

economic data.  The rationale paragraph could again begin by noting that the

accommodative stance of policy and vigorous growth in productivity are providing

ongoing support to economic activity.  In view of the data received over the

intermeeting period, the Committee might wish to repeat the comment that “output is

expanding briskly.”  However, given the divergences among the household and

payroll surveys and other labor market indicators, the Committee may now want to

characterize the labor market as “showing mixed signals” rather than as “improving

modestly.”  The statement could again note that price increases remain muted and

that inflation is expected to remain low.  By contrast, if the Committee elects to ease

policy at this meeting, the rationale paragraph would presumably need to be

augmented to note the Committee’s desire to help maintain the vigor of the economic

expansion and to guard against a significant further decline in inflation, or, perhaps, to

indicate its desire for a reversal of some portion of the recent disinflation.  If the

Committee elects to tighten policy, the rationale paragraph could be modified to note

the current low real funds rate relative to measures of its equilibrium level.



12

(16) The range of choices regarding the balance-of-risks paragraph will

depend importantly on whether the Committee decides to alter its communication

strategy following the discussion of that topic on the first day of the meeting.  This

Bluebook assumes that the Committee decides to retain, at least for this meeting, the

framework employed in the December announcement.  If so, and if the Committee

sees relatively little change in its assessment of the outlook, it may wish to issue a

statement similar to that of the last meeting, with the risks to the prospects for economic

growth in balance, the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation almost equal to

that of a rise in inflation, and no mention of an overall assessment of risks.  Because

the latest inflation data have been rather soft, the Committee might prefer to omit the

reference to diminished disinflation risks, and merely provide relative odds of the

change in inflation as in: “The probability of a fall in inflation appears only slightly

above that of a rise in inflation.” 

(17) Alternatively, the Committee may wish to consider changing its assessment

of risks to sustainable economic growth.  The Committee may have seen risks to the outlook

for economic growth in December as balanced on the view that, although output was

likely to expand above trend for a time, it was likely to slow to a sustainable pace by

the time the level of output reached that of its potential.  If, instead, Committee

members interpret the term “sustainable economic growth” as simply denoting

potential output growth and see the growth of spending as likely to exceed that of its 

potential for the next few quarters, they may prefer to announce at this meeting an

assessment of net upside risks to sustainable growth.

(18) The Committee may also wish to alter its characterization of the degree of

balance regarding the inflation outlook at this meeting.  The strength of incoming data on

spending might be taken as implying that the probability of an unwelcome fall in

inflation has dropped even further.  While the Committee still may see some



13

possibility that inflation ticks lower, it may also judge that outcome as much more 

likely to occur in the context of a rapidly expanding economy with robust productivity

growth rather than slowing demand.  Thus, the Committee might prefer a roughly

balanced assessment of the probabilities of a rise or unwelcome fall in inflation. 

Alternatively, the surprisingly low recent inflation readings and the chance of a higher

productivity scenario with large persisting output gaps and disinflation pressures may

lead the Committee to retain at least the modest asymmetry about the inflation

outlook adopted at the last meeting. 

(19)  Another issue related to the policy announcement is whether to retain,

modify, or delete the sentence “However, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the

Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”  The

Committee’s treatment of this statement may depend on its views regarding the likely

timing and steepness of a tightening phase for policy, as reflected in the previous

discussion of alternative long-run inflation goals.  If the Committee took its goal of

price stability to be consistent with a longer-run inflation rate above 1 percent, then

presumably it would put low odds on firming policy anytime soon and would be

relatively more comfortable with retaining the “considerable period” sentence without

modification.  However, if members see an increased chance that, with continuing

substantial financial accommodation, a combination of robust economic growth and

higher inflation expectations will boost inflation above an acceptable range over the

next year or two, it might want to delete this sentence to provide the flexibility for a 

near-term tightening of policy should that prove necessary.  The backup in interest

rates, drop in the stock market, and rise in the dollar that would likely result from

deleting this sentence might be seen by the Committee as a check on the extent of

financial stimulus in the economy.  Even if the Committee put low odds on tightening

policy sometime soon, it may view the cost of either delaying needed tightening or



14

reneging on its commitment, should inflation pressures pick up unexpectedly, as

sufficiently damaging to its credibility to warrant removing the “considerable period”

preemptively.  However, the Committee could move gradually toward eventually

deleting the sentence by declaring, for example, “With inflation quite low and resource use

slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in adjusting the very accommodative stance of

monetary policy.”  Market participants would likely read such a change as preparing the

way for an eventual removal of the current highly accommodative policy stance, and

interest rates would likely back up as investors brought forward the anticipated onset

of tightening. 

(20) If the Committee decides to retain a sentence, possibly in modified form,

regarding the period for which policy accommodation can be maintained, it may feel

that such a statement provides a sufficient summary assessment of the policy outlook

and thus decide, as in December, that a separate sentence on the overall balance of risks

is not needed.   Even if the Committee drops the considerable-period sentence, if it

views the risks to achieving sustainable growth as balanced and the probabilities of an

increase or an unwelcome fall in inflation as close to balanced, then it may think an

explicit statement of the overall risk assessment is redundant.  However, if the

Committee now believes that there are upside risks to sustainable growth or that the

risk of disinflation remains clearly larger than the probability of an increase in

inflation, it might want to consider resuming an announcement of the overall risk

assessment. 

(21)  Should the Committee wish to follow the same procedure as at the last

meeting, it could vote on the directive and on language associated with the

announcement regarding the risk assessment.  Draft language with a range of options

is provided below. 



15

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in

output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate

future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO an

average of around ___ 1 percent.

(2) Risk Assessment

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes that the risks to the attainment of sustainable

economic growth over the next few quarters [ARE WEIGHTED

TOWARD THE DOWNSIDE] [are roughly equal] [ARE WEIGHTED

TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; the probability of an unwelcome fall in

inflation [THOUGH MINOR, EXCEEDS] [is almost equal to] [IS

ABOUT EQUAL TO] that of a rise in inflation.

           [TAKEN TOGETHER, THE OVERALL RISKS TO THE

COMMITTEE’S OBJECTIVES ARE ROUGHLY IN BALANCE.]  [THE

PROSPECT OF GROWTH ABOVE A SUSTAINABLE RATE IS THE

PREDOMINANT CONCERN.]  [THE RISK OF INFLATION

BECOMING UNDESIRABLY LOW IS THE PREDOMINANT

CONCERN.]



16

Market Reaction

(22) Market participants universally expect no change in the stance of

monetary policy at this meeting and generally view a change in the FOMC’s risk

assessment as unlikely.  Thus, market prices would presumably be little affected by a

statement encompassing no change in policy, no change in the risk assessments, and

no change in the considerable-period sentence.  By contrast, interest rates could rise

substantially in response to a statement that eliminated the considerable-period

sentence, particularly if accompanied by a risk assessment suggesting increased

concerns about excessively rapid economic growth.  The market reaction would be

more subdued with a modified considerable-period sentence that continued to leave

the impression that a tightening of policy was not imminent and would likely be

gradual once begun.

(23) Investors would be caught unawares by a decision to ease policy at this

meeting, and other short-term interest rates would decline with the federal funds rate. 

The consequences for longer-maturity yields would depend on the wording of the

announcement and the market’s reading of the implications of the decision for longer-

term inflation rates.  Intermediate- and longer-term yields would likely fall, and

especially sharply if the announcement conveyed a sense that the FOMC intended to

keep policy more accommodative for some time in order to counter the risks of a

shortfall in aggregate demand or of disinflation pressures stemming from upward

shifts in productivity.  Given this downward revision to investors’ expectations about

the path of policy, stock prices would likely rise, and the dollar would fall.  A decision

to tighten policy at this meeting would similarily come as a shock to market

participants, as it would seem at variance with their interpretation of the FOMC’s

recent communication efforts.  Interest rates would likely rise sharply, though the

extent of the increase in longer-term rates could be dampened somewhat by a



17

reduction in expectations for the long-run rate of inflation.  The stock market would

likely sell off substantially, and the dollar would rise.

Monetary and Credit Aggregates

(24) The staff anticipates that M2 will resume growing this quarter. 

Refinancing effects should exert considerably less drag, and rapid growth of nominal

income should provide a lift to money growth.  Still, the velocity of M2 is expected to

continue rising, as investors continue to favor capital market instruments at the

expense of M2 assets.  Over the period from December through June, M2 is projected

to expand at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate.

(25) Growth of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to

moderate this year but to a pace that still exceeds that of nominal income.  Much of

the deceleration reflects a slowing in the expansion of mortgage credit, as mortgage

rates are expected to remain close to current levels for several quarters.  Federal debt

growth should rise this year but then drop back sharply in 2005 following the

anticipated turn toward fiscal restraint.  Despite reports of an easing in loan standards

in the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey and the fairly narrow risk premia on

corporate bonds, borrowing in the business sector is expected to pick up only slowly,

as internal funding continues to be sufficient to cover projected increases in capital

outlays and inventories over the next few quarters.

Appendix A:  The December FOMC Announcement

Paragraph Text

1. Policy decision The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.

2. Rationale The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative
stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying
growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing
support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over
the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding
briskly, and the labor market appears to be improving
modestly.  Increases in core consumer prices are muted and
expected to remain low.

3. Assessment of
risks

The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks
to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few
quarters are roughly equal.  The probability of an unwelcome
fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now
appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. However,
with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee
believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a
considerable period.

4. Vote Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan
Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman;
Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus, Jr.; Roger
W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald
