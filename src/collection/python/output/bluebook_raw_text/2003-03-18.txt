1  Market participants had almost uniformly anticipated that the Committee
would keep policy on hold at its January 28-29 meeting, so that there was little
reaction when that expectation proved true.  Over the intermeeting period, the
effective federal funds rate averaged close to its 1-1/4 percent target.  The Desk met
reserve drains caused by strong currency growth with outright purchases of $9.4
billion (settlement basis), about evenly split between bills and coupons, using up all
but $2.6 billion of its authorization to purchases securities outright (the “leeway”). 
The Desk met its additional needs through a $2 billion increase in long-term RPs,
bringing their level to $16 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) With the probability of imminent war having increased, investors

apparently shifted away from some aspects of risk taking, intensifying downward

pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period.  The fall in

stock prices, which cumulated to about 3 percent for broad indexes, was amplified by

lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor markets, and

consumer confidence.  Financial markets were quite sensitive to shifting perceptions

of the likelihood of war.  For instance, just today equity prices rallied sharply and

bond yields rose markedly, on news of a possible delay in a new U.N. resolution on

Iraq.  On net, market participants seemed to interpret developments over the

intermeeting period as suggesting that the onset of vigorous economic growth would

be a little more delayed than previously expected.  The term structure of money

market futures rates tilted down, as investors appear to have once again put off the

time at which policy is expected to begin tightening, shifting the date from mid-

summer to late in the year, and reducing the expected amount of tightening by the

middle of next year by 35 basis points.1  (Additional detail about policy expectations is

provided in the box on the next page.) 



Monetary Policy Expectations

Money market futures suggest that investors have trimmed their expected path of
the federal funds rate as much as 3/8 percentage point over the intermeeting period
(Chart 1).  As for the upcoming FOMC meeting, the April federal funds futures
contract is now trading about 8 basis points below the FOMC’s intended rate of  
1-1/4 percent, consistent with a one-in-three chance of a 1/4 percentage point
easing on March 18.  Market chatter seems to put the odds of action lower than
this, suggesting that the futures rate embodies some possibility of a 1/2 percentage
point move.  Analysts are increasingly of the view that at this meeting the
Committee will shift its assessment of the risks to its objectives from balanced to
tilted toward economic weakness.

According to options prices, the implied probability distribution for the funds rate
six months hence has become more skewed to the downside.  Indeed, about
8 percent of the probability mass now rests at levels of the federal funds rate at or
below 50 basis points. 

2

(2) Treasury coupon yields dropped 10 to 30 basis points over the

intermeeting period, on net, pulled down by lower policy rate expectations and

perhaps by enhanced investor demands for safety (Chart 2).  Much of these declines

were accounted for by lower forward rates at the two- to seven-year maturities,

consistent with the view that the level of economic activity would be on a lower track

for some time.   Indexed-debt yields declined by more than those on their nominal

counterparts, implying an edging higher of implied inflation compensation.  Survey

measures of longer-term inflation expectations, in contrast, held steady.

(3) Despite the evident jitters about the possibility of war and increasing

concerns about economic fundamentals, declines in rates on investment-grade private

instruments somewhat exceeded those on comparable-maturity Treasuries.  Risk

spreads for lower tier instruments were about unchanged at high levels, and measures

of implied volatility in stock and bond markets remained elevated.  The term structure

of implied volatilities calculated from options on swap forwards suggest that much of

that uncertainty pertains to the near-term outlook:  Further out this term structure,

those measures of volatility decline sharply.  The reduction in stock prices and yields

on fixed-income securities were accompanied by considerable flows out of equity

mutual funds and into government and, especially, other bond mutual funds (Chart 3). 

Falling equity prices and interest rates further widened the spread between the

forward earnings-price ratio and the real longer-term Treasury yield, a measure of the

equity premium, to levels of the early 1990s.   

(4) After moving mostly sideways on balance against the major foreign

currencies for the first part of the intermeeting period, the dollar has fluctuated in a

wide range in recent days.  On net, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has

slipped 1 percent against a basket of major foreign currencies, losing 3-1/4 percent

against the Canadian dollar and edging lower against the euro and the yen.  Share

prices have declined substantially in the major foreign markets, reaching multi-year

lows in Japan and Europe before rebounding somewhat at the end of the period. 

Consistent with a global shift toward fixed-income assets, yields on long-term

government securities also were down on net, although the declines were smaller

abroad than in the United States. Additional signs of economic weakness in key euro-

area countries – especially Germany – prompted the ECB to cut its key policy rates 25

basis points on March 6.  Policy actions to counter downward pressures on activity

were also taken in the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  The Bank of England

lowered its repo rate 25 basis points in early February, and the Swiss National Bank in

early March cut further its already very low range for policy rates to counteract the

deflationary effects of Swiss franc strength.  In contrast, the Bank of Canada raised its

target for the overnight rate by 25 basis points earlier this month to blunt inflationary

pressures.  In Japan, the announcement that Toshihiko Fukui will become the next

    .   The Desk did not intervene during the period for the
accounts of the System or Treasury    .

Governor of the Bank of Japan served to diminish expectations that monetary policy

might become considerably more expansionary.  Official yen sales continued as the

dollar moved lower later in the period.2 

(5) The dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting period against an

index of the currencies of our other important trading partners.  The dollar rose 

about 6 percent against the Korean won, while Korean stocks declined more than 11 

percent, largely in reaction to rising tensions in that part of the world.  The Mexican

central bank sought to bring inflation down with another round of tightening in early

February, but uncertainties about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery weighed

on the peso at times during the period.  On balance, though, the exchange value of

the peso firmed about 1 percent against the dollar.  Brazilian financial markets

continued to improve, even as the Brazilian central bank tightened policy another

notch in February by raising its target overnight interest rate 1 percentage point.  The

real strengthened about 5-1/2 percent, and the spread over Treasury yields of Brazilian

sovereign debt issued in dollars (Brazil’s EMBI+ spread) narrowed about 320 basis

points during the period. 

(6) The pace of business borrowing receded in February from the brisker

pace of January, but remained somewhat above that of the fourth quarter (Chart 4). 

Business borrowing continued to be concentrated in bond financing, as firms

exploited the historically low level of longer-term interest rates by paying down

outstanding short-term debt with the proceeds of bond issuance.  Household debt

growth continued to be dominated by heavy mortgage borrowing.  Growth of





5

consumer credit, after stalling in the fourth quarter, jumped at banks in January and

February, in part owing to tax refund anticipation loans.  The pace of federal

borrowing picked up in the first quarter, and federal debt outstanding reached its

statutory limit in mid-February.  However, the Treasury has been able to use

accounting devices to allow its regular auctions to go forward.  Although down from

the high level of late last year, issuance of state and local bonds has remained strong

this year.  Backward-looking measures of corporate asset quality–bond default rates

and C&I loan delinquency rates–are showing signs of stabilization or even some

improvement.  With equity prices in a downdraft, gross equity issuance has remained

subdued and net issuance negative.

(7) M2 growth was exceptionally strong in February, owing mainly to robust

inflows to liquid deposits.  Rapid money growth appeared to reflect earlier tax refunds

(owing to greater use of electronic filing) and hefty mortgage prepayments as record

low interest rates spurred refinancing activity.  Money growth may also have

benefitted from the ongoing retreat from equity markets.  The expansion of liquid

deposits additionally reflected shifts from other components of M2, including retail

money funds–whose yields have fallen to about the same level as MMDA rates–and

small time deposits.  The ample availability of low-cost deposit funds over the past

year has facilitated wide net interest margins at commercial banks, to the benefit of

their profitability, the subject of the box on the next page.



6

Bank Profitability in 2002

Banks’ returns on assets and equity both moved up smartly last year, the former to a three-
decade high.  A major contributor to the rise in profitability was a large drop in noninterest
expense, an important part of which appears to be attributable to a regulatory change that
eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill unless it is impaired.  A low level of bank
mergers last year also likely held down noninterest expense.  Salaries and benefits, however,
which had been falling for several years as a share of revenue, edged up in 2002.  Profitability
also benefitted considerably from a large widening of interest rate spreads, which in turn
importantly reflected a surge in low-cost transaction and savings deposits as investors
responded to the very low opportunity cost of holding liquid assets and adverse
developments in equity markets.  In addition, falling longer-term interest rates allowed banks
to realize sizable capital gains on securities holdings for the second consecutive year in 2002. 
Finally, loan-loss provisioning, which had risen sharply in 2000 and 2001, held steady last
year, albeit at twice the pace of the mid-1990s.  

Although banks began last year with very comfortable capital levels, they chose to boost
them further by retaining income at somewhat above the pace of the preceding two years. 
The rise in risk-based capital measures was particularly large, reflecting the shift in banks’
portfolios away from full risk-weight business loans toward lower risk-weight residential
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.  With the cushion of additional capital,
commercial banks appear relatively resilient going forward.

Policy Alternatives

(8) The broad contours of the staff forecast remain similar to those of the

January Greenbook, with moderate growth of activity giving way to robust expansion

in the second half of this year.  However, recently some sour economic

releases–particularly indicators of labor market conditions and consumer

sentiment–and lower equity prices and higher oil prices in the baseline forecast have

led the staff to write down somewhat weaker growth of real GDP this year and next as

well as a higher unemployment rate at the end of the Greenbook forecast interval. 

Partly as a result, this forecast assumes that the intended federal funds rate will hold at

1-1/4 percent throughout the forecast period, rather than turning upward in the

second half of 2004 as in the prior Greenbook.  As was true in the January Greenbook,

the current forecast does not embody a specific scenario for resolution of the conflict

with Iraq.  Rather, the forecast is premised on financial assumptions that are guided by

current market quotes that appear to be consistent with a high likelihood of a relatively

short and successful war but that also encompass a range of potential resolutions of

that conflict.  This is most evident for oil prices, which the staff assumes will fall

substantially in coming quarters in line with the current configuration of oil price

futures.  Equity prices are assumed to increase from their current level over the

forecast period at a rate that provides investors with a risk-adjusted return comparable

to that on longer-term bonds.  Corporate bond yields are pulled lower over the

forecast period as a gradual improvement in the economic outlook and a partial lifting

of uncertainty spur a narrowing in risk spreads.  With these assumptions, GDP growth,

after running below that of potential over the first half of this year, begins to pick up

smartly as falling oil prices, improving sentiment, accommodative monetary policy, and

tax cuts provide a lift to household and business spending.  However, even with an

acceleration in GDP in 2004 to a 4-1/2 percent pace, output at the end of the forecast



8

period remains about 3/4 percent below the staff’s estimate of potential GDP and the

unemployment rate is 5-1/2 percent, about 1/2 percentage point above its estimated

natural rate.  The persistent slack in resource usage is large enough to offset the effect

on core inflation of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar; core PCE prices are projected

to rise about 1-1/4 and 1 percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

(9) If the Committee remains of the view that the current setting of the

federal funds rate likely would provide enough stimulus to redress the existing amount

of resource slack over time while maintaining low inflation, it may wish to keep the

target rate unchanged.  To be sure, global tensions have escalated in recent weeks,

and the uncertainties associated with developments in Iraq and the attendant rise in oil

prices seem to be weighing heavily on financial markets and restraining economic

activity.  But the Committee may believe that a significant portion of these

fundamental uncertainties will be resolved before long and–as was the case following

the onset of the Gulf War in 1991–lead to a notable improvement in financial market

conditions (Chart 5).  Moreover, although many observers have worried that higher oil

prices may continue to depress spending, as discussed in the Greenbook, it is persistent

increases in oil prices that have materially adverse implications for activity.  In fact,

futures and options data suggest that market participants do not expect the currently

elevated level and uncertainty about oil prices to persist (Chart 6).  Moreover, while the

nominal price of oil has approached historical highs, the recent spike does not appear

outsized in real terms.  Even if the Committee is concerned that the pace of economic

growth could remain subpar once some of the current uncertainties have been

resolved, it still may see a considerable advantage to deferring policy action at this time

in order to await more information about geopolitical developments.  Indeed, inaction

at this meeting might seem especially attractive if the Committee wants to preserve the

option of easing forcefully if events turn unexpectedly adverse in coming weeks.

Moreover, in the current environment, the response of the economy to policy action at

this meeting might be viewed as quite uncertain, and models of optimal monetary

policy under uncertainty would counsel gradualism in adjusting policy.  

(10) If the Committee viewed the range of possible outcomes for the

economy over the foreseeable future as fairly symmetric around its forecast, it might

also choose to retain a balanced risks assessment at this meeting.  While some

economic data have proved disappointing of late, a successful prosecution of a war in

Iraq could trigger a substantial rally in equity markets and prompt a sharp rebound in

confidence, suggesting that upside risks may be significant.  The Committee might also

favor a neutral balance of risks if it regarded the risks as unusually difficult to assess

and subject to rapid change.  If, instead, the Committee judges that the distribution of

possible outcomes for economic activity is appreciably skewed toward more downbeat

scenarios, it might be inclined to shift the balance of risks toward economic

weakness, although it may be concerned that markets could see such a decision as a

signal of more conviction about the outlook than it actually has.

(11) Because current futures quotes put some odds on an easing at this

meeting, a decision to leave the target rate unchanged and the risk assessment balanced

would likely prompt an increase in market yields and a corresponding downtick in

stock prices.  However, in light of the unusual geopolitical aspect to the uncertainties

about the near-term outlook and the prospect that they may be partly resolved

sometime soon, market participants are not likely to extrapolate this monetary policy

combination very far forward in revising their expectations, which would work to mute

the likely market reaction.  In principle, keeping policy unchanged but shifting the

balance of risks toward economic weakness would come closer to matching current

market expectations, and their heightened expectation of more imminent easing would

tend to offset disappointment about the lack of immediate action.  In practice, though,



10

market participants may infer from the Committee’s decision to alter the risks

assessment that the economic outlook was bleaker than previously expected, pulling

bond yields and stock prices lower.

(12) The Committee might interpret some of the recent data, particularly the

February employment report, as pointing to a weaker trend in economic activity than it

previously thought–and one that might well persist even if global tensions were to

diminish markedly in the weeks ahead.  Against this backdrop, the Committee might

conclude that a policy easing at this meeting is appropriate.  Indeed, the current

setting of the real federal funds rate no longer lies below the lower bound of the range

of staff estimates of equilibrium real rates (Chart 7).  As a result, members might

conclude that a cut in the nominal funds rate would be necessary just to maintain the

effective stance of policy established at the November meeting.  The Committee might

consider a quarter-point policy easing as a measured response to a projected

shortfall of economic growth below that of potential this year.  However, the

Committee might instead favor a more aggressive half-point policy easing if the

possibility of especially adverse shocks and the constraints on policy posed by the zero

bound to nominal interest rates loomed large in its thinking.  The apparent stability of

inflation expectations in the face of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar along with the

Greenbook projection for further declines in core inflation from already low levels

might be viewed as arguing for the more aggressive policy action, inasmuch as its

potential cost in terms of higher risks of inflation pressures would appear to be

minimal.  Indeed, the Committee might even welcome a small uptick in projected

inflation.  Moreover, the market response to a successful prosecution of war in Iraq is

not entirely clear.  In contrast to the experience around the Gulf War in 1991, concerns

about geopolitical tensions may not be punctured by decisive military victory, as

questions could still linger about the formulation of a new government in Iraq, the

prospect for terrorist acts, and the situation in other trouble spots.

(13) As noted, market prices can be interpreted as incorporating some odds

on a policy move at this meeting, but a quarter-point easing is far from fully priced in.  

As a result, either a quarter-point or half-point easing at this meeting would have a

substantial element of surprise.  Bond and stock prices would tend to climb in either

case, but the market reaction could be significantly influenced by the choice of the

balance-of-risks assessment and the wording of the announcement.  A balanced risks

assessment would likely be taken by market participants as a sign that the FOMC

would be reluctant to ease more anytime soon, while a balance of risks tilted toward

economic weakness would lead them to place higher odds on further policy easings.  

(14) Under the Greenbook assumptions, growth of domestic nonfinancial

debt is expected to run at about a 7 percent pace this year and next.  In the business

sector, the projected recovery in investment spending is associated with a notable

increase in the financing gap, which in turn, leads to an upturn in business borrowing. 

With credit spreads contracting, the forecast anticipates that much of this increased

demand for financing will be met by firms tapping capital markets.  Businesses are

projected to continue to rely heavily on the bond market, while commercial paper and

bank loans, after running off sharply over the past two years, are expected to be about

unchanged this year and register a modest advance in 2004.  A gradual relaxation in

bank terms and standards may well also to contribute to the projected rise in business

loans.  In contrast, households should rein in the growth of mortgage debt in response

to the assumed leveling off of mortgage rates, which reduces the incentives for cashout

refinancings.  The expansion of consumer credit probably will dip this year, largely

reflecting a moderation in the pace of spending on motor vehicles.  Federal borrowing

is expected to rise over the forecast period, propelled by rising military expenditures

and by tax cuts that trim receipts.  State and local debt growth is forecasted to taper

off, with state and local governments anticipated to scale back advance refunding

issuance and also to take steps to restore balanced budgets.  The staff projects M2 to

advance at a 6-1/2 percent pace this year–somewhat faster than nominal GDP growth. 

The anticipated decline in M2 velocity this year is attributable to the lagged effects of

the policy easing last November and to a further boost to money growth from

mortgage refinancing.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(15) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for

(1) the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press

release issued after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO

an average of around ___1-1/4 percent.

(2) “Balance of Risks” Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes that the risks [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY

TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY GENERATE ECONOMIC

WEAKNESS]  [are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals]

[ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY 

GENERATE HEIGHTENED INFLATION PRESSURES] in the

foreseeable future.
