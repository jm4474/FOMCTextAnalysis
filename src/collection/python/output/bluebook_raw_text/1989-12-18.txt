Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC December 15, 1989

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the FOMC meeting on November 14, open market opera-

tions have been aimed at maintaining the reserve conditions established

after the slight easing in early November. The allowance for adjustment

and seasonal borrowing incorporated in the nonborrowed reserve objective

remained at $200 million until a technical adjustment to $150 million was

made in the second full maintenance period to take account of a further

decline in seasonal borrowing.1 Federal funds have traded mostly around

8-1/2 percent. The funds rate dropped notably below this level around

Thanksgiving, however, after market participants erroneously concluded

that policy had been eased again. A reserve injection just before Thanks-

giving to meet a sizable seasonal need at a time when federal funds were

at 8-3/8 percent triggered this perception, which was subsequently revers-

ed by draining reserves the following Monday at an early hour. The ne-

cessity to drain reserves at a time when projections pointed to a reserve

shortfall contributed to a bulge in borrowing to $419 million in the main-

1. Seasonal borrowing declined from $150 million immediately after the
last FOMC meeting to $90 million in the maintenance period ended
Wednesday, December 13.
2. The reserve injection on Wednesday was in the form of a 5-day

System RP over the period spanning Thanksgiving and the subsequent week-
end. The market's perception of ease was reinforced by a newspaper's
stories on Friday reporting confirmation by "government officials."
Reserves were absorbed on Friday, but the federal funds rate did not
return to around 8-1/2 percent until the earlier than usual draining
operation on Monday.



tenance period ending November 29. In the second and most recent complete

period, borrowing averaged $130 million.

(2) With no change in policy and incoming economic information

generally consistent with expectations of slow growth in the economy, most

market interest rates are little changed on balance from the last FOMC

meeting. The yield curve remains inverted at the short end, as it has

since late October, suggesting the market continues to expect further

declines in short-term rates.

(3) In long-term markets, the gap between the average yield on

lower grade junk bonds and other market rates has widened further, as

investor resistance to these securities intensified in the face of further

problems among issuers. Partly in response to difficulties in the junk

bond market in recent months, the pace of net equity retirements in the

fourth quarter has been well below that of the third. Despite this slow-

down and disappointing third-quarter corporate earnings, most major stock

indexes advanced 1 to 3 percent over the intermeeting period, with the Dow

Jones rising 5 percent. Indexes of thrift and bank stock prices dropped,

however, in response to spreading problems in real estate markets. None-

theless, the spread between rates on bank money market instruments and

Treasury bills remained unusually narrow.

(4) The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar

declined by almost 4 percent over the intermeeting period. The dollar

fell by 6-1/2 percent against the mark, mainly reflecting events in

Eastern Europe and their supposed favorable implications for the German

economy, and by somewhat less against other EMS currencies. The dollar



was unchanged against the yen, and fell slightly against sterling.

the Desk sold $150 million against the yen.

Interest differentials against major industrial countries showed little

change over the period; three-month rates in both Germany and Japan eased

back a bit, while long bond rates in those countries were about unchanged.

Rates in some European countries drifted higher as they resisted downward

pressures on their currencies relative to the DM.

(5) Growth of M2 picked up a bit further in November, to an 8-

1/2 percent pace, bringing the rate of increase from September to 8-1/4

percent, above the 7-1/2 percent path specified by the Committee for the

September-to-December period; preliminary data through December 11 suggest

continued robust expansion this month. The strength in M2 reflects ear-

lier declines in market interest rates and has been concentrated in its

liquid interest-bearing components, where the decreases in opportunity

costs have been greatest. Noncompetitive bidders at Treasury auctions

have been running down their holdings, providing corroborating evidence of

substitution out of market assets. Demand deposits contracted last month,

reversing almost one-half of October's surge, and M1 growth slowed to a 3-

1/2 percent rate despite a continued double digit rate of expansion in

other checkable deposits.3

3. The runoff in demand deposits caused total reserves to contract in
November, following two months of rapid growth. Expansion of the
monetary base also slowed, reflecting, in addition to the weakness in
its reserves component, a continued sluggish expansion of currency.



(6) M3 expanded at a 6 percent pace in November, the fastest

rate since the summer, and the average October-November pace of 5-1/4

percent was above the Committee's expected 4-1/2 percent growth for the

September-to-December period. Partial data through the first part of

December indicate that this aggregate is continuing to expand at close to

its November pace. The acceleration in November occurred as the contrac-

tion of the thrift component of managed liabilities in M3 abated. This

reflected less aggressive efforts on the part of solvent but capital-

deficient thrifts to shed assets and a hiatus in activities by the Reso-

lution Trust Corporation (RTC). M3 also was boosted last month by

strong growth in institution-only MMMFs, since yields on these funds

tended to lag the decline in market rates.

(7) Expansion of the debt of nonfinancial sectors evidently

slowed last month, apparently owing, at least in part, to shifts in

financing patterns rather than reductions in borrowing to finance spend-

ing. For example, a moderation in business borrowing was accounted for

largely by a reduced issuance of junk bonds and a slowing in the pace of

equity retirements. In addition, while the federal deficit was about

unchanged, borrowing fell as the Treasury drew down its cash balance.

And, offerings of state and local securities also were cut back, but

mostly in the area of advance refundings. Information on the household

sector is sparse; consumer lending at banks continued brisk, probably

4. The RTC neither advanced funds nor resolved any cases in November,
though insolvent thrifts continued to enter conservatorship. The pace
of resolutions has been slowed by the absence of a formal strategic plan
of action (one has been out for public comment) and concerns about
insufficient working capital.



reflecting a further increase in their share of consumer credit. Growth

of real estate loans at banks slowed slightly in November, though this may

reflect more caution in commercial lending.

(8) All the monetary and debt aggregates are ending 1989 within

their annual ranges, as can be seen in the table below, with growth moder-

ating from 1988. Through November, M2 expanded at a 4-1/2 percent rate

from the fourth quarter of last year, down 3/4 of a percentage point from

1988. M2 growth was damped by a slowing of growth in nominal income, as

well as by the lagged effects of the year-long rise in interest rates and

opportunity costs that came to an end in March. Within the year, M2

growth showed a pronounced pattern: through midyear higher interest rates

and unusually large personal tax payments held the aggregate below its

target range; subsequent rate declines and a rebuilding of liquid balances

boosted M2 to just below the midpoint of its annual range. The pattern

was even more pronounced for M1, given its greater interest elasticity;



this aggregate declined at around a 5 percent rate in the first half of

the year before rebounding in the second. On balance M1 is about un-

changed over the year, and growth of its velocity likely equalled the

fastest pace in three decades. Events in the thrift industry have not had

much effect on the overall level of M2, although growth was skewed heavily

towards its bank deposit and money market mutual fund components. By

contrast, M3 growth this year--at 4 percent, a bit above the lower bound

of its 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent range--has been damped considerably by the

liquidation of thrift assets and infusions of funds by the RTC. Although

banks probably absorbed some of these assets, many mortgages and mortgage-

backed securities apparently were acquired by other investors and thus not

financed by M3 liabilities. The expansion of nonfinancial debt

decelerated about in line with GNP this year, and it is expected to finish

the year about 8 percent above its level in the fourth quarter of 1988,

near the midpoint of its 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(9) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee

consideration. The specifications of alternative B involve federal funds

continuing to trade in the 8-1/2 percent area in association with adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing of $150 million. Under alternative A, the

federal funds rate would decline to the 8 percent area accompanying a

decline in adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to $100 million. Federal

funds would return to the 9 percent area under alternative C, associated

with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $200 million. The differences

in the borrowing levels among the three alternatives, $50 million, is only

half that contained in recent bluebooks. The low level to which seasonal

borrowing has fallen, together with the continued close proximity of

adjustment borrowing to frictional levels, implies that borrowing probably

has become even more unresponsive to the spread between the funds rate and

the discount rate.5  Uncertainties in the relationship between the funds

rate and borrowing, even more of a problem at such low levels of

borrowing, continue to call for flexibility in the Desk's approach to the

borrowing objective.

(10) Money growth paths from November to March associated with

each alternative are shown in the table below. (More detailed data appear

in the table and charts on the following pages.) Boosted by earlier

declines in interest rates, M2 growth under all the alternatives would

continue fairly strong, running through the first quarter at or above the

upper end of its tentative 3 to 7 percent target cone for 1990, though

declines should be less than over the most recent intermeeting period.



within the associated parallel band. The outlook for M3 continues to be

clouded by considerable uncertainties about thrifts. One source of uncer-

tainty pertains to the rate at which solvent but capital-deficient in-

stitutions pare assets in order to meet new FIRREA capital requirements.

Another is the near-term activity of the RTC; absent provision for working

capital early next year, RTC's scope for completing deals and replacing

high-cost funds in the first quarter may be limited. As noted above, both

RTC activity and S&L asset runoffs appear to have diminished substan-

tially, but we expect these factors to become more important in the months

ahead, retarding M3, though not to the degree of late summer and early

fall.6 As a consequence, M3 growth is projected to continue below that

of M2, leaving this aggregate in March in the middle portion of its

tentative range.

(11) The markets have built in some additional easing of policy

in the near term, and as federal funds continue to trade around 8-1/2

percent under alternative B, money market rates might firm a little.7

Any tendency for rates to rise is likely to be tempered if incoming infor-

mation points to sluggish economic growth, consistent with the staff fore-

cast, so that markets retain but push back their expectations of the next

easing step. Bond yields are likely to stay around current levels under

these circumstances. Bond prices could rally should more definite pros-

pects for substantial deficit reduction emerge from the upcoming Adminis-

tration budget as well as the implications of developments overseas for

future defense expenditures. With policy unchanged, the dollar might show

little further depreciation, unless key foreign central banks tighten

policies further.

(12) Under alternative B, M2 would expand at an 8 percent annual

rate over the November-to-March period, near the pace of recent months.8

Growth would continue to be buoyed by previous declines in market interest

rates, causing a further reduction in the velocity of this aggregate at a

1-3/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Expansion would remain

concentrated in its more liquid components, whose opportunity costs have

narrowed the most. Small time deposits could strengthen a little now that

RTC no longer is providing additional funds to replace high-cost deposits.

7. The federal funds rate may temporarily exceed this level around
year-end; markets now appear to have built in funds rates in the area of
10 percent over the long New Year's weekend.
8. The staff does not believe that the availability of foreign cur-

rency deposits in the United States beginning in January will have much
impact on the monetary aggregates. Such deposits will be excluded from
the aggregates, and the amount of shifting to foreign currency accounts
from dollar deposits in the aggregates is expected to be small.



-12-

In these circumstances, intervened thrifts may continue to bid more ag-

gressively to retain or replace maturing brokered deposits, as they have

in recent weeks, prompting other depository institutions to raise their

offering rates. While most of the small time deposits would come from

other M2 sources, some might be diverted from outside M2, given the more

favorable deposit rates. Growth in the M1 component would be expected to

be around 6 percent over the November-to-March period, sustained by in-

flows to OCDs and some augmenting of demand deposits around year-end to

meet compensating balance requirements. By March, M2 would have grown

8 percent at an annual rate from its fourth-quarter base; but absent any

significant changes in the funds rate, M2 subsequently would be expected

to moderate to within its tentative annual target cone in the third

quarter.

(13) M3 is expected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate under

alternative B, in line with its faster pace of October and November.

Growth of this aggregate may decelerate over the quarter, damped by run-

offs of assets at capital-deficient thrifts as well as by a resumption of

RTC activity at insolvent institutions. Credit growth at banks should

remain close to the pace of recent months; these institutions will con-

tinue to fill some of the void in residential and consumer installment

lending and acquisitions of mortgage securities caused by the withdrawal

of the thrift industry.

(14) Debt of private nonfinancial sectors is expected to continue

to grow around the slower pace that has come to prevail in the latter part

of 1989. To some extent this may result from a more cautious attitude of



-13-

lenders facing not only mounting problems in junk bond and real estate

markets but also the possibility of greater credit difficulties by house-

hold and business borrowers more generally as income growth slows.

Residential mortgage borrowing should continue to expand around its recent

pace, buoyed by the modest recovery in housing activity in response to

reduced mortgage rates. Elsewhere in the household sector, consumer cre-

dit growth is expected to strengthen a bit, reflecting a near-term re-

covery in spending on durables. With the financing gap unchanged and

restructuring activity damped, business borrowing should remain around the

reduced pace of recent months. The federal government will continue to be

a heavy user of credit to finance a still-large federal deficit in the

first quarter. Over the November-to-March period, growth of domestic

nonfinancial debt is expected to be around 7 percent, placing the debt

aggregate in the lower portion of its tentative 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent

monitoring range for 1990.

(15) The easing of policy under alternative A would be a little

more than now seems to be anticipated by market participants over coming

weeks. In response to a drop in the federal funds rate to the 8 percent

area, money market interest rates would decrease about 3/8 percentage

point, with the three-month bill trading around 7-1/4 percent. Bond rates

should move lower, especially if market participants viewed the economy as

being fairly weak so that such a measure would not appreciably raise the

risk of higher inflation, though judging from the tepid response of bond

markets to the putative easing around Thanksgiving, any declines might be

small. The dollar could weaken significantly further.



-14-

(16) With the further drop in interest rates, growth in M2 would

strengthen under alternative A to a 9 percent annual rate over the Novem-

ber-to-March period, placing this aggregate noticeably above the upper end

of its tentative growth cone. In the absence of a subsequent tightening

of policy, expansion of M2 would be likely to remain quite strong for some

time, especially if the lower interest rates fed through to greater spend-

ing and demand for money than in the staff forecast. Under alternative A,

growth in M3 would firm to a 6 percent rate over the November-to-March

period, a bit above the midpoint of its tentative 1990 range. A decline

in market rates might not boost M3 in line with previous experience, since

higher prices on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities could encourage

the sale of assets by thrifts.

(17) Alternative C would restrain M2 growth to around the upper

bound of its 1990 growth cone by March, putting it on a track toward the

middle of its tentative range; such a move would seem to increase the odds

on more noticeable progress toward price stability, with assistance from a

stronger dollar, albeit with greater risk of an economic downturn. The

accompanying slowdown in M3--to an expected 5 percent annual rate over the

November-to-March period--would cause this aggregate to drift downward in

the lower half of its tentative 1990 growth range. A tightening of policy

would come as a surprise to market participants, and short-term interest

rates would rise by more than the 50 basis point increase in the federal

funds rate. Bond rates initially would rise, though this increase might

be retraced if markets came to see the move as part of a longer-term

strategy to restrain spending and prices. An aspect of this restraint



-15-

would be a transition period that involved a weaker outlook for profits,

downward pressure on various asset prices, and an intensification of

strains in certain vulnerable areas of the financial system, with

implications for intermediaries and other lenders.

Directive Language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

standard options and updating, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price

stability, the strength of the business expansion, the

behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in

foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly

(SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint might (WOULD) or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (MIGHT) would

be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with

growth of M2 and M3 over the period from NOVEMBER THROUGH

MARCH [DEL: September through December] at annual rates of about

____ AND ____ [DEL: 7-1/2 and 4-1/2] percent, respectively. The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears

to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve

conditions during the period before the next meeting are

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7 to 11] percent.
