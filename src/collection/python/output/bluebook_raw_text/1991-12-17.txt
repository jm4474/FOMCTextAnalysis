Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Strictly Confidential (FR)
Class I - FOMC December 13, 1991

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) As a result of deliberations at the November 5 FOMC meet-

ing, monetary policy was eased slightly the next day. The discount rate

was cut 1/2 percentage point to 4-1/2 percent, with federal funds

expected to fall 1/4 percentage point to around 4-3/4 percent. One

month later, as economic indicators continued to point toward a falter-

ing recovery and growth in the broad monetary aggregates remained slug-

gish, policy was eased again, with the funds rate moving to around 4-1/2

percent. In the initial policy move, the formal allowance for adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing was left unchanged, as a $25 million

increase in the allowance to reestablish a gap between the funds rate

and the discount rate was offset by an equivalent technical reduction to

take account of the ebbing of seasonal borrowing. Four more cuts of $25

million were made in the borrowing allowance over the remainder of the

intermeeting period--three of them were technical adjustments and one

was policy-induced. Borrowing averaged around its formal allowance over

the entire period, and federal funds generally traded quite close to

their intended level, averaging 4.78 percent over most of the period,

before softening to 4.50 percent in the days since the most recent

policy action.

(2) The Federal Reserve's actions and growing evidence that

the economic recovery had stalled contributed to substantial reductions

in U.S. interest rates and to a downward movement in the dollar exchange

rate. Most money market rates dropped 1/2 percentage point or more as

markets incorporated the declines in the federal funds rate and



anticipations of further near-term easing. The prime rate also came

down 1/2 point to 7-1/2 percent. Expectations of more subdued economic

activity contributed to declines in rates farther out the yield curve as

well. Rates on intermediate maturity securities decreased almost as

much as short-term rates, and the yield on thirty-year Treasury and on

corporate bonds dropped about 25 basis points over the period. Mortgage

rates also fell about 1/4 point and, at 8.53 percent, are now at a

seventeen-year low. Declines in interest rates were not sufficient to

offset the effect on stock prices of negative news on the economy and

profits, and broad stock indexes are down slightly on balance. Shares

in banking corporations were harder hit, and money center bank stocks

are down nearly 9 percent over the same period, owing in part to

Congressional consideration of a cap on credit card interest rates and

to passage of a bill without additional powers for banks.

(3) The decline in the weighted average exchange value of the

dollar was about 2-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. Despite

the negative effects on the DM of events in the former Soviet Union, the

dollar fell more than 3-3/4 percent against the mark, reflecting expec-

tations by market participants of further tightening by the Bundesbank

in the near future. As a consequence, the mark was strong not only

against the dollar, but within the EMS as well;

the

1. Private-sector one-month rates are among the few exceptions:
They jumped as their maturity date moved into the new year, reflecting
strong demands to lock in funding over year-end, and are down only
modestly on balance. Although some borrowers evidently are cautious
about the availability of credit at year-end, disruptions to normal
funding patterns and associated pressures on money markets generally
are expected to be substantially less intense than last year.



The dollar declined a little less than 1 percent

against the yen, as evidence accumulated of a further slowing in the

Japanese economy and as the Bank of Japan eased monetary policy somewhat

further.

(4) The cumulative drop in short-term market interest rates

over recent quarters and the associated decline in opportunity costs

contributed to a turnaround in M2 growth in the last two months.

Despite the sluggish growth in nominal income, the broader monetary

aggregates have shown some modest upward momentum after registering

declines over the third quarter. M2 grew at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate

in November and appears on track to meet the 3 percent pace for the

September-to-December period specified by the Committee at its last

meeting. M3 picked up to a 2-3/4 percent rate in November and most

likely will exceed somewhat the 1 percent rate expected for the three

month period. Both monetary aggregates remain right around the lower

bounds of their target ranges.

(5) The narrowing of opportunity costs has been most pro-

nounced for liquid deposits. Transactions deposits expanded at about a

20 percent rate last month, lifting Ml growth to 15-1/4 percent, despite

a slowing in currency. Savings deposits (including MMDAs) also rose

rapidly, but small time deposits and money fund shares continued to run

off. Much of this runoff no doubt represented a redirection toward

liquid deposits within M2, but part of it likely remained a net drag on

the aggregate as investors moved into capital market instruments in a

quest for higher yields. Inflows to bond and stock mutual funds, which

2. Total reserves accelerated from a 16 percent pace in October to
a 20-1/2 percent rate of growth in November. With currency growth
more subdued, however, the monetary base increased at just a 6-1/2
percent pace in November, down from 10 percent in the preceding month.



again were very heavy in October, are said to have remained robust in

November.

(6) The resumption of M3 growth in the last two months was

fostered by a hiatus in RTC activity (which thus exerted less of a

depressing effect on thrift credit) and a strengthening in bank credit

growth in October and November. Bank credit was buoyed by continued

heavy acquisitions of U.S. government securities and by some turnaround

in loan growth in November. Total loans had been on the decline for a

number of months, but the resumption of growth in real estate loans and

strength in some small, but volatile, loan categories outweighed sizable

declines in business and consumer loans in November.

(7) Despite the turnaround in bank loans, growth in the debt

of domestic nonfinancial sectors, excluding the federal government, is

estimated to have stayed subdued in recent months. Financial inter-

mediaries have remained very cautious lenders, with intermediation

spreads showing little sign of narrowing, and borrowers have continued

restructuring balance sheets to reduce and lengthen debt. Nonfinancial

firms resumed issuing commercial paper in November and their bond

issuance has been substantial, but C&I loans have been weak, restraining

that sector's aggregate debt growth. With inventories evidently in

check and fixed investment expenditures down, business funding needs

have been relatively subdued. An additional factor holding down debt

growth has been the heavy issuance of corporate equities, as firms have

deleveraged and taken advantage of attractive stock prices. With mort-

gage rates coming down, home mortgage activity appears to have picked up

a bit, although much of the strengthening likely has been refinancings.

Gross bond issuance by state and local governments was strong last



month, as the cumulative drop in interest rates attracted more borrow-

ers, but with much of this for refunding purposes, net borrowing by the

sector remained subdued. Preliminary data suggest that total debt of

the nonfinancial sectors continued to grow at about a 6 percent pace in

October. Some ebbing of the rapid pace of federal debt growth points in

the direction of a slowing of overall debt in November.

(8) For the year, the debt aggregate is likely to grow at a 5

percent pace, toward the lower end of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent moni-

toring range. Federal government debt has expanded at around an 11-1/2

percent rate in 1991, with Treasury borrowing to finance the acquisition

of assets by deposit insurance funds adding 1/2 percentage point to

total debt growth. Excluding the federal government, debt increased at

a 3 percent rate over this period; in contrast to the pattern over the

1980s, this was about in line with nominal income. In addition to

slower growth of spending, borrowing has been held down by efforts to

reduce debt burdens--for example, by issuing equity and drawing down

monetary assets to finance spending. An additional factor restraining

credit growth and spending has been added caution on the part of some

lenders, as seen in tighter standards for credit and unusually stiff

price and nonprice terms.

(9) Reluctance to extend credit has been especially pronounced

at depositories, and has also been an element in the sluggish pace of

money growth. Constraints on credit supply, together with weak demand,

and the acquisition of thrift assets by the RTC resulted in a substan-

tial decline in total depository assets in 1991. M3 grew nonetheless--

though only 1 percent for the year--owing importantly to a marked rise

in money market funds over the year and substitutions of "Yankee" CDs

issued by foreign banks for non-M3 sources of funds since the cut in



reserve requirements one year ago. For retail deposits, institutions

have aggressively reduced offering rates on small time deposits, raised

fees, and cut back on advertising. In an effort to maintain returns in

the face of declining rates on M2 assets, many depositors appear to have

moved out a steepening yield curve into capital market instruments.

Partly as a result of these factors, M2 growth in 1991--at 2-1/2 per-

cent--has fallen about 3 percentage points short of the rate predicted

by the staff's money demand models. Instead of declining, as would have

been expected in response to the sharp narrowing of opportunity costs,

velocity is expected to post a slight increase over the year as a whole.

Policy Alternatives

(10) Two alternatives are given below for Committee considera-

tion. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would continue to

center around 4-1/2 percent, in association with the allowance for ad-

justment plus seasonal borrowing staying at $75 million.3 Alterna-

tive A incorporates a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the funds rate

to 4 percent, which could be implemented in either of two ways--by

reducing the borrowing allowance to $25 million while keeping the dis-

count rate unchanged at 4-1/2 percent, or by cutting the discount rate

to 4 percent while keeping the borrowing allowance unchanged at its

current level. Although the former variant of alternative A, which

involves funds trading 1/2 percentage point below the discount rate,

would be technically possible, it likely would be associated with

somewhat greater day-to-day volatility in the funds rate. In addition,

the unusual negative spread could engender confusion among market par-

ticipants, with some speculating that a discount rate cut was imminent

and others perceiving a signal that monetary easing in this economic

cycle was over.

(11) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B,

interest rates may exhibit an initial tendency to firm a little, as

market expectations of another modest policy easing in the near term are

disappointed. If incoming data tend to confirm the staff's forecast of

some slippage in economic activity this winter, however, expectations of

policy easings of the scope now contemplated by the market are likely to

resurface, restoring the three-month Treasury bill rate to around its

current quote of 4.15 percent. Similarly, the exchange value of the

February.



dollar could edge higher temporarily, but would probably end up trading

around recent lower levels. Bond yields could well move lower on bal-

ance by early next year, as the market's realization of the extent of

economic sluggishness tends to reduce both real rates and inflationary

expectations. However, any such bond market rally could be derailed if

it looks as though a political consensus is emerging on measures for

substantial fiscal stimulus; the effects on bond yields would be

especially adverse if it appeared that such measures would undermine the

discipline in last year's budget agreement intended to produce smaller

deficits over time. Announcement of a significant shift in Treasury

auctions away from longer-term notes and bonds and toward bills would

precipitate some decline in bond rates and rise in bill rates--judging

from recent market reactions to such proposals.

(12) Under alternative A, the 1/2 percentage point fall in the

funds rate to 4 percent would foster a smaller drop in other short-term

interest rates, given the expectations of near-term policy easing al-

ready incorporated in current market quotes. The three-month Treasury

bill rate would probably drop to around 4 percent or a bit below. The

prime rate would be cut by 1/2 percentage point, preserving its current

wide spread over funding costs. Bond yields also probably would decline

immediately, though by less than the drop in short rates. Unless data

were clear-cut in pointing to continuing weakness in the economy, the

half-point easing of alternative A--closely following the quarter-point

decline in the funds rate last week--would be seen as signalling a

priority on encouraging a strong recovery. As a result, any reduction

in inflation expectations would tend to be delayed. The exchange value

of the dollar likely would extend its recent decline. The staff

anticipates only modest decreases in foreign interest rates on average



-10-

over coming months, as cost pressures in Germany remain intense and

German interest rates put a floor under rates in other EC countries.

(13) Projected money growth rates under the two alternatives

over the interval from November to March are shown in the table below.

(More detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following

pages.) Growth in the broader aggregates is expected to continue at a

rather slow pace in coming months. Under alternative B, both M2 and M3

are projected to be only somewhat above the lower edges of their tenta-

tive 1992 target cones in March. Even under the lower short-term inter-

est rates associated with alternative A, these aggregates probably would

remain noticeably below the midpoints of their ranges.

to March

M2 3-3/4 3

(14) Growth in the broader monetary aggregates will continue

to be restrained by sluggish expansion of nominal income. Moreover,

other forces that have depressed money growth, and thereby buoyed

velocity relative to historical patterns, are expected to persist into

next year. Over the next four months, a resumption of resolutions of

insolvent thrifts and consolidations of banks imply a drag on retail

deposits and managed liabilities. More generally, depositories are

unlikely to bid aggressively for deposits, given prospects for virtually

no loan growth. Household balances probably will continue to be

deflected from M2 into capital market instruments, even if longer-term

market interest rates edge lower in response to weaker-than-expected

economic activity or further monetary policy easing. The differential

between longer-term market rates and returns on M2 balances still would

remain unusually wide, and any capital gains on market instruments could

augment their appeal to retail investors by boosting their reported

returns. Finally, the process of household deleveraging, involving

reductions both in borrowing and in acquisition of monetary and other

assets, is unlikely to abate substantially in coming months. Relative

to predictions of standard models of M2 demand, using the interest rates

of either alternative, the staff projections for the first quarter imply

around a 3 percentage point shortfall of M2 growth in the first quarter,

given greenbook income. However, some of the factors restraining

monetary expansion in the first quarter relative to income and interest

rates may well hold down subsequent spending as well, so that the slow

M2 growth cannot simply be interpreted as a benign downward shift in

money demand with no implications for spending.

(15) Under alternative B, both M2 and M3 are projected to grow

a little more slowly than their average rates over October and November.

M2 would be expected to post a 3 percent growth rate from November to

March, and M3 a 1-1/2 percent rate. Nominal income is projected to

grow at about the same rates in the fourth and first quarters, and

given the usual lags, the effects on money demand of the declines in

interest rates through early December also would be roughly comparable

in the two quarters. It is the resumption of RTC activity early next

year that is responsible for the slight ebbing of M2 growth. Restraint

4. Over the four months through March, M1 is expected to grow at a
10-1/2 percent rate, spurred by strong growth of transactions depos-
its. Required and total reserves are projected to advance at a 16
percent rate, while the monetary base expands at an 8 percent rate.
This projection has made no allowance for an unwinding of an ongoing
reserve avoidance practice involving NOW accounts and large time
deposits, which would be disallowed under a proposed revision to
Regulation D to be considered by the Board in January. The staff
estimates that closing this loophole could add around 1 percentage
point to growth in M1 over the first quarter.



-13-

on M3 growth will be exerted not only by heavier RTC activity but also

by a moderation in the expansion of bank credit and funding needs with

the fading of special factors that have boosted bank lending recently.

(16) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to

grow at a 5 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter of this year

through next March. Such growth would place the debt aggregate just

above the lower bound of the FOMC's provisional monitoring range for

next year. Federal debt likely will expand at about an 11 percent rate

through March, elevated in part by the financing of resolutions of

depository institutions. Nonfederal debt growth over the same interval

is seen remaining at nearly a 3 percent rate. This forecast assumes no

major change in the degree of caution exercised by borrowers or lenders.

However, further tightening of credit terms could result should lending

officers involved in upcoming bank consolidations begin to behave more

cautiously or should unanticipated deterioration in loan portfolios make

banks' access to funds more uncertain.

(17) The lower short-term interest rates associated with

alternative A would put M2 on a path that would carry it toward the

middle portion of its range later in 1992. This impetus would be

supplied in the first months of the year by lower opportunity costs of

holding money, and later by the boost to income flows from the decline

in interest rates. From November to March, M2 is projected to turn in a

3-3/4 percent growth rate under alternative A. The acceleration would

be wholly concentrated in liquid deposits, which should respond to the

narrowing of their opportunity costs. While deposit rates will be

reduced further--perhaps appreciably at some institutions, if lower

market rates jolt them into reassessing long-standing rates on NOW

accounts and passbook savings--they are not likely to drop enough to



-14-

eliminate the additional stimulus to money growth of the lower interest

rates in alternative A. The induced pickup of inflows to liquid depos-

its should more than offset greater outflows from small time deposits

and M2-MMMF shares into capital market instruments with increasingly

attractive relative returns. The faster M2 growth under alternative A

will show through to M3, though in muted form, since bank and thrift

credit growth will accelerate by less than M2 in the short run.

Directive Language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including

the usual options and updating, is presented below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat/MAINTAIN/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. Depending upon progress toward price stability,

trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary

aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic

financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve

restraint might (WOULD) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint (MIGHT) would be acceptable in the intermeeting

period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from

NOVEMBER THROUGH MARCH [DEL: September through December] at annual

rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 3 and 1] percent, respectively.

ANNEX

Directive Sentence on Possible
Intermeeting Changes

At its meeting on August 20, the Committee discussed the

sentence in the directive that includes a listing of the factors that

guide possible changes in monetary policy during intermeeting

periods. The sentence currently reads as follows:

Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends
in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary
aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and
domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve
restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint
would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

At the suggestion of the Chairman, Governor Kelley subsequently

polled the members with regard to their preferences among three

alternative proposals that were made during the meeting. In a

memorandum to the Committee dated September 25, 1991, Governor Kelley

reported an inconclusive result: seven members were in favor of retain-

ing the current list (subject to a formal review each year); seven pre-

ferred to reword the factors, keying them more directly to the Commit-

tee's long-run ranges and making them sufficiently general to apply in

most circumstances without raising the issue of relative ranking: and

two opted for eliminating the listing altogether and explaining the

Committee's guidance from meeting to meeting in the text of the policy

record.

Of the many members who expressed an interest in reviewing the

directive sentence at least yearly, several indicated a preference for

doing so at the December meeting. Three alternatives are presented

5. Relates to item 4 in the agenda for the December 17 meeting.
6. Background for this discussion was provided in memoranda from

Governor Kelley and Mr. Kohn circulated on August 14, 1991.

below for consideration at the upcoming meeting. The Committee would,

of course, retain the option of revising the language at every meeting

and of introducing special language in the event of unusual developments

such as the stock market crash in October 1987. In any case, on the

basis of the comments communicated earlier by many members, the Commit-

tee might want to review this directive instruction formally at least

once every year.

Proposed Alternatives

1. The Committee may wish to adopt broad language keyed to its

long-run objectives and sufficiently general to apply in most circum-

stances without raising questions about the ranking of the factors. One

proposal along these lines is:

In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives
for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and
giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and
monetary developments, somewhat/slightly greater reserve
restraint or somewhat/slightly lesser restraint would/
might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

2. Alternatively, the Committee may wish to continue to follow

the current approach with its list of factors.

If the Committee were to decide to retain this

approach, a separate question would be whether to change the order of

the factors themselves at this time. The existing order gives prece-

dence to what the Committee may consider to be its most important long-

run objective, that of achieving price stability. Moreover, the evi-

dence of progress toward that objective has been an important factor in

the Committee's willingness to ease. Alternatively, the members may

wish to change the order at least for the near term by moving the

reference to trends in economic activity to the head of the list.

Because the sentence on intermeeting adjustments is in the operational



-18-

paragraph, a change in ordering could be viewed as desirable if the

Committee had as its near-term priority promoting a pickup in the

economy and wished to emphasize that point. This need not imply that

the Committee now considers the long-term objective of price stability

to be any less important--and this point could be emphasized in the

policy record--because the lead sentence in the directive paragraph on

the long-run ranges would continue to indicate that "the Committee seeks

monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output."

3. Finally, the Committee may wish to delete the list of

factors altogether and to provide any desired explanations of the

Committee's thinking in the text of the policy record. In this case,

the relevant sentence might read:

Somewhat/slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat/
slightly lesser reserve restraint would/might be accept-
able in the intermeeting period.
