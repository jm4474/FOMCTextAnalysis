The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 declined at about a 3 per cent annual rate in October,

but data for early November are consistent with the staff forecast of

a substantial rebound in the current month. For the two-month target

period, M1 is projected to expand at an annual rate of about 4 per

cent, somewhat above the low end of the Committee's range of tolerance.

With growth in consumer-type time deposits a little stronger than

projected, M2 is expected to grow at about a 7½ per cent annual rate over

the two-month target period--somewhat above the mid-point of its

tolerance range.

(2) There was some increase in total short-term business credit in

October. Outstanding business loans at banks expanded by a relatively sizable

amount, mainly at banks outside the major money market centers, but this was

offset in part by another decline in commercial paper issued by nonfinancial

corporations. Outstanding bank CD's have shown little change since the

build-up that occurred in late September and early October. While this

mainly reflected the continuing weakness in business loans at large banks,

several New York City banks appear to have experienced some investor reluctance

to acquire their CD's and did not aggressively seek such funds. These banks

also relied less than they usually do on purchases of Federal funds during

the past month and generally have lengthened the maturities of their managed

liabilities.

(3) Immediately following the October FOMC meeting, the Desk

sought reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate in a 5½ to

5¾ per cent range but with the expectation that the rate would be moved down

to 5 per cent unless incoming data on the aggregates indicated more rapid

growth. Data available shortly after the Committee meeting did in fact

suggest some strengthening in monetary growth causing the Desk to slow the

movement to a 5½ per cent rate. As a result, the funds rate averaged 5.65

per cent in the week ending October 29. When subsequent data suggested a

considerable weakening in the aggregates, the Desk followed a more

accommodative approach to reserve provision, and the funds rate moved to the

5¾ per cent lower limit of the Committee's range of tolerance. As the

funds rate dropped increasingly below the discount rate, member bank borrowing



-3-

dwindled. Although the latest data indicate a strengthening in the aggregates,

the Desk has continued to aim at a funds rate around 5 per cent in view

of the proximity of the November Committee meeting and the continuing un-

certainties affecting financial markets.

(4) Short-term rates dropped another 20-50 basis points over the

intermeeting period, with the largest decline occuring in Treasury bill-rates. In

longer-term markets yields have also declined somewhat further except on

municipals. Municipal yields which had declined in early October from the

peak reached at the turn of the month, advanced again in late October and

early November. Most recently, however, some of this advance has been erased

as the market has come to believe that a settlement of the New York problem

is in the offing.

(5) Deposits at savings and loan associations and mutual savings

banks grew during October at an annual rate of around 11 per cent, about

the same as in September. Given the sharp declines in market rates, managers

of thrift institutions reportedly have become more optimistic about the

future course of deposit flows and therefore less cautious about extending

new mortgage commitments. Interest rates on primary mortgages have dropped

slightly; the Home Loan Bank series shows a decline in the average rate on

new commitments for 80 per cent conventional mortgages from 9.25 to 9.17

per cent over the intermeeting period. In the secondary market, average

yields in FNMA auctions dropped about 30 basis points.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Summarized below for Committee consideration are three

alternative sets of short-run specifications for monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate. All three alternatives are intended to be

consistent with the FOMC's longer-run objectives for the aggregates, as

indexed by a 5-7½ per cent rate of growth in M1 from QIII '75 to QIII '76.

Each of the alternatives, therefore,implies a different pattern of interest

rate developments, as summarized in appendix table IV and as explained

in the ensuing paragraphs.

RPD 5½-7½ 5-7 4½-6½

Federal funds rate 4¼-5 4¾-5¾ 5¼-6¼

(8) Under alternative B the Federal funds rate range is

centered around the recently prevailing 5¼ per cent level. M is once

again expected to begin growing at a reasonably rapid rate; under this

alternative growth over the two-month November-December period is

estimated to be in a 6½-8½ per cent annual rate range. The main basis

for this expectation is the growing need for transactions balances

associated with the 14½ per cent annual rate of expansion in nominal

GNP projected by the staff for the fourth quarter M1 growth in Nov.-Dec.

result in expansion from QIII '75 to QIV '75 at a rate of about 2¾ per cent,

implying a rise in income velocity at about an 11 per cent annual rate between

those quarters. This would be an extremely large rise even for the early

stages of an economic recovery, particularly if, as assumed, it is not

associated with upward interest rate pressures during the quarter.

(8) Such a large rise in velocity would not appear to be long

sustainable at current interest rate levels, given the reduction in the

public's cash balances relative to income that has already occurred and

given the continued, even though somewhat diminished, rate of expansion

projected for nominal GNP in 1976. With the demand for money likely to

continue to rise, the staff would expect the Federal funds rate to increase

in the course of next year if the rate of growth in M1 is to average near

the mid-point of the FOMC's longer-run target range of 5-7 per cent. By

summer, the funds rate might peak out at around 7½ ½er cent. This would be

lower than had been projected by the staff at the time of the last meeting.

(9) If the funds rate shows little change over the next few

weeks, the 3-month bill rate might be in a 5 -6 per cent range. The rate

could show some tendency to rise from its recent trading level of about

5.40 per cent because the increase in short-term credit typical of the

holiday season will coincide with continued sizable net additions to

outstanding bills by the Treasury to raise new cash. Short-term rates will

also be heavily influenced by developments with respect to New York. A

resolution of the problem would affect attitudes and expectations in a manner

likely to put upward pressure on rates, whereas a dashing of hopes would

have the opposite effect.



-7-

(10) With bond volume in the corporate and municipal markets

expected to be generally moderate, longer-term market interest rates are

likely to show little further net change between now and year-end under the

specifications of alternative B. If the New York situation is resolved

without default, yields in the municipal market could well show significant

declines. Primary mortgage market yields are likely to edge down over the

period ahead in lagged reaction to earlier declines in short-term interest

rates and corporate bond yields, and in light of a continued relatively

comfortable inflow of savings funds to thrift institutions.

(11) Both banks and nonbank thrift institutions may experience

more favorable net inflows of time and savings deposits over the next

several weeks than they had in late summer and early fall, when market

interest rates were higher. However, very recent experience suggests

no more than a modest pick-up. Because upward pressures on interest rates

in the fourth quarter of 1975 and now projected for 1976 are weaker than

those antitipated earlier, consumer-type time deposit flows are no longer

expected to slacken substantially in the near future. Accordingly, the date

for an assumed upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates has been

shifted forward, from year-end to mid-1976.

(12) Alternative A contemplates a modest further decline in

the Federal funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting, to the

mid-point of a 4 -5 per cent range. This would tend to strengthen forces

making for a rebound in growth of the monetary aggregates and would also



-8-
be more accommodative of any increase in demands for liquidity should

uncertainties with regard to municipal markets and banks continue. We

would expect that such a reduction in the funds rate would have to be reversed

at least by early next year in order to keep longer-run growth in M1 at

around the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent range, and that by Spring the funds

rate would be around 7¾ per cent.

(13) A reduction in the funds rate over the next few weeks of

about the dimensions contemplated under alternative A would probably be

accompanied by similar declines in other short-term rates and by some further

decline in longer-term market rates. Mortgage market yields would also be

likely to drop as the outlook for continued savings inflows brightens. But

declines in mortgage yields, as well as in security rates, may be limited

insofar as market participants view the easing in money market conditions

as temporary. Market attitudes will, of course, be influenced by the nature

of incoming economic news and by the degree of use, if any, of other monetary

policy instruments.

(14) Alternative C involves some rise in the Federal funds rate

over the next few weeks, to the mid-point of a 5 -6 per cent range. Such

a reversal in the recent trend of the funds rate would likely be accompanied

by a sharp rebound in market rates; the 3-month bill rate, for example, might

promptly move up to the 6-6½ per cent area. But if interest rates are pushed

up over the next few weeks, it is likely that less of an increase would

be required over the longer run than under alternatives A or B, since an

early start will have been made in restraining money demand. It seems

probable that the alternative C strategy might lead to a funds rate that



peaks out at around 6¾ per cent next year. Thus, over the longer run this

approach would place less pressure on banks and thrift institutions. In the

short run, however, recent easing tendencies in bank and mortgage loans rates

would be quickly reversed.

(15) Among the assumptions made in developing the specifications

presented in this blue book are: (a) no more than modest business loan growth

at banks in view of (i) expected conservative inventory investment policies

by business that would limit their demand for bank credit and (ii) continued

relatively cautious bank lending policies; and (b) unwillingness of major

banks to actively press CD's on the market in the period immediately ahead.

In addition, it has been assumed that there will be no significant further

impairment of confidence in the municipal market and banks.

Proposed directive

(16) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the

Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions in terms of

desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No alternatives

are presented for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference to

desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and that at

this meeting the Committee will not reconsider its present 5 to 7 per cent

target range for M1, with which all of the short-run operating alternatives

discussed in the preceding sections are consistent.

"Monetary Aggregate" proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial

markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in

monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

(17) Should the Committee desire to formulate the directive in

terms of bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would

depend on the specific conditions sought. Alternative "money market"

directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

are given below.
