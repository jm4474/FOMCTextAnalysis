Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M-1 accelerated to an annual rate of 19 per

cent in April, partly reflecting the sharp rebound in economic

activity that is in process. In addition, the month appears to

have been affected by transitory tax-related factors, including a

build-up in individual cash balances to make larger than usual

nonwithheld tax payments and some delay by the Treasury in processing

such payments. M-1 is expected to increase at about a 6-1/2 per cent

annual rate in May, given data thus far available in the month,

bringing growth over the April-May period to around a 13 per cent

annual rate, well above the upper end of the Committee's range. The

rapid expansion of M-1 also has boosted growth in M-2 over April and

May to about an8-3/4 per cent annual rate, near the upper end of

its two-month range. The pick-up in deposit growth in April enabled

banks to accelerate their acquisitions of earning assets to a 21

per cent annual rate. Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions

remained weak in April.

(2) As incoming data on the aggregates continued to

strengthen following the April FOMC meeting, the Desk raised its

Federal funds rate target to around 7-1/4 per cent from the 6-3/4

per cent level which had prevailed since early January. At a tele-

phone conference meeting on May 5, it was reported that growth in

M-1 appeared to be well in excess of the Committee's range and growth

in M-2 at the top of its range. To provide time for more evidence

on the economy and on the extent to which the strength in the aggre-

gates would subside, the FOMC decided that the Desk should continue

aiming for a 7-1/4 per cent Federal funds rate. However, the Manager

was instructed to be more tolerant of deviations of the funds rate

above the desired level than below it, and in the most recent state-

ment week the Federal funds rate averaged 7.32 per cent.

(3) The increase in the Federal funds rate from the earlier

6-3/4 per cent level induced a sharp rise in member bank borrowing from

Federal Reserve Banks. In the statement week just ended, such borrow-

ing totalled $1.7 billion, up from a level of $239 million in the week

of April 19. The discount rate was raised 1/2 point to 7 per cent on

May 11, in order to bring it into better alignment with market rates,

and most recently member bank borrowing has declined substantially.

Still, increased member bank borrowing on average is estimated to supply

the bulk of the 11-1/4 per cent expansion in total reserves over the

April-May period.

(4) Along with the rise in the Federal funds rate, most

short- and longer-term market interest rates have risen by 20 to 45



-3-

basis points since the April Committee meeting, and the bank prime rate was

increased from 8 to 8-1/4 per cent. Demands of nonfinancial businesses

for short-term credit remained quite strong, as evidenced by substantial

increases in both commercial paper and bank business loans in April.

The Treasury, on the other hand, has paid down $12 billion of cash mange-

ment bills since the April tax date, contributing to a relative scarcity

of short-term bills. The reduction in the available supply of these

instruments has helped to limit the response of many short-term interest

rates to the firming of money market conditions. In its mid-May refund-

ing, the Treasury redeemed $1.9 billion of the $5.9 billion of publicly

held maturing issues and offered a total of $4 billion in a 10 year note

and a 22-1/4 year bond. Dealers distributed the bulk of their awards

of the bond and about half of their holdings of the new notes within a

day or two of the auction. Despite the rise in interest rates, stock

prices have moved higher on balance over the inter-meeting period.

(4) Conditions in mortgage markets have continued to tighten.

Rates on primary conventional mortgages have risen 15 basis points since

mid-April, bringing the increase in this rate over the first four months

of 1978 to about 1/2 percentage point. In addition, savings and loan

associations reduced their outstanding level of loan commitments again

in March, and concern about further upward movements in mortgage rates

has contributed to a marked rise in offerings at FNMA auctions of forward

purchase commitments.

(6) The table on the next page shows percentage annual rates

of change in related monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(7) The table below presents for Committee consideration

two alternative sets of specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate for the forthcoming intermeeting period.

(More detailed and longer-term data for the aggregates are shown in

the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)

Alt. A Alt. B

Ranges for May-June

M-1 4½ to 8½ 4 to 8

M-2 5 to 9 4½ to 8½

Federal funds rate 7 to 7¾ 7½ to 8¼
(Intermeeting period)

(8) Growth in M-1 is expected to slow considerably over

the two-month May-June period from the extraordinary April rate, partly

because the temporary impact of tax-related factors should be unwinding.

Under alternative A--which encompasses a range for the Federal funds

rate centered on its recently prevailing level of around 7-3/8 per

cent--M-1 is expected to expand in a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate

range over the May-June period. Given this projection, the level

of M-1 in each month of the second quarter would be above

levels implied by the FOMC's longer-run range, as shown in

Chart 1 on the following page. Growth in M-1 in the second quarter

would be at a 9¼ per cent annual rate, reflecting for the most

part the sharp rebound in economic activity this quarter, when

nominal GNP is now anticipated to expand at a 17½ per cent annual

rate.

(9) Growth in M-2 over the May-June period is also likely

to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under alternative A.

Unlike levels of M-l, the implied levels of M-2 would be generally

within the longer-run ranges adopted by the Committee for this

aggregate, as shown in Chart 2 on the following page.1/

(10) The recent and expected near-term increases in market

rates of interest will probably be associated with continued slow

growth in savings deposits. Banks are expected to benefit only

modestly from the June 1 introduction of the new 6-month and 8-year

certificates, because these instruments are likely to be particularly

attractive to the most interest-sensitive depositors who will probably

2/
take advantage of the higher rates offered by thrift institutions.2/

However, with loan demands expected to remain large, and demand deposits

decelerating from their rapid growth in April, banks are projected

to step up significantly their issuance of large-denomination

time deposits. Since a major portion of such instruments are included

in M-2, the interest-bearing component of this aggregate is expected

to pick up somewhat from its reduced March-April pace.

(11) Even if the funds rate does not rise significantly

from recent levels, other short-term rates could edge up further

1/ Charts 3 and 4 showing the relationship between the short-run
behavior of M-3 and bank credit and their longer-run ranges may
be found following page 16.

2/ On May 11, the Federal regulatory agencies announced authorization
of a new 8-year certificate at ceiling rates of 8 and 7¾ per cent
at thrifts and banks, respectively, and a 6-month, $10,000 minimum,
certificate whose ceiling rate floats with the auction rate on
6-month Treasury bills; the 6-month certificate ceiling is of
a percentage point more than the bill rate for thrifts and equal
to the bill rate for banks.

over the weeks ahead. Issuance of commercial paper and bank CD's is

likely to be substantial in coming weeks to accommodate the expected

large business demands for credit. Moreover, the Treasury is not

expected to retire bills, as it did following the April tax date, and

it is possible that the Treasury may issue a sizable short-dated cash

management bill in early June. Finally, if the dollar continues to

strengthen on exchange markets, foreign official accounts might become

significant net sellers of bills.

(12) Long-term rates are expected to show relatively little

change under the conditions of alternative A. Public offerings of

corporate bonds are projected to remain moderate over the coming

weeks, and State and local bond issuance should drop off markedly

in late May after the effective date of the new IRS ruling with

regard to sinking fund provisions of tax-exempt bond offerings. On

the other hand, the Treasury--after retiring about $2 billion of

coupon securities in the latest refunding--will probably raise about

$2 to $2 billion of new cash when it sells the regular four-year

cycle note in early June. In addition, the FHLB System will announce

terms for its mid-quarter refunding early next week, and is expected

to raise about $1 billion in this operation. Receptions for these

offerings could be quite good, however, since dealers have distri-

buted the bulk of their awards of the Treasury refunding issues

and have reestablished a short position in coupon issues.

(13) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal

funds rate to the mid-point of a 7½ to 8¼ per cent range between

now and mid-June. M-1 growth would likely be in a 4 to 8 per cent



-10-

annual rate range over May and June and M-2 growth in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2

per cent range. Under this alternative, short-term rates generally

might rise 1/2 percentage point or a little more. With loan demands

expected to remain sizable, relatively prompt upward adjustments

in the prime loan rate may be anticipated. Moreover, a rise in

member bank borrowings would also increase pressure for another

discount rate adjustment. Bond yields too could be expected to

rise, though increases may be limited since current market yields

have probably anticipated some further monetary tightness. The

widening spread between interest rates in the United States and

the rest of the world would tend to provide support for the exchange

value of the dollar.

(14) The staff believes that over the QI '78 to QI '79

period interest rates will have to rise to levels significantly

higher than previously projected if M-1 growth is to be restrained

to the mid-point, or perhaps even the upper half, of its 4 to 6½

per cent longer-run range. M-1 is now expected to expand at about a

9¼ per cent annual rate in the second quarter--3¼ percentage points

more than projected last month. Consequently, in order to achieve

5¼ per cent M-1 growth over the four-quarter period, interest

must rise sufficiently to restrain M-1 growth to an annual rate below

4 per cent over the remaining three quarters--an interval in which

nominal GNP is projected to grow at an 11-3/4 per cent annual rate.

The implied rates of increase in velocity--shown in Appendix II--are

unusually large, more than twice the average of the past two years.



-11-

(15) The Federal funds rate level that the staff believes

will be needed to induce such velocity increases are shown in

Appendix I. Under alternative A the Federal funds rate might need

to rise by fall into a range of 9 to 10 per cent--about one percentage

point higher than projected last month.1/ These projections assume

some further downward shift in the demand for money--as a result, for

example, of more intensive marketing of previously introduced innovations

2/
and cash management services as interest rates rise.- It should be

noted, though, that the relationship between money demand, income,

and interest rates in the Board's econometric model has not generated

any evidence of a further downward shift over the past five quarters.

(16) Under either alternative A or B, growth over the

quarters ahead of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings

will slow more than projected last month. Not only are market

interest rates now expected to be higher, but the upward adjustment

in deposit rate ceilings announced by the regulatory agencies is less

1/ Under alternative B, restraint would be introduced earlier and,
as a result, the level of the funds rate required at the end of
the longer-run policy period would be somewhat less--possibly in
an 8¾ to 9¾ per cent range.

2/ However, the staff as yet has made no allowance for the impact on
measured M-1 of automatic transfers from savings accounts to demand
deposits, scheduled to be authorized at commercial banks on November
1. This service is expected to have a significant depressing
impact on the level of M-1, as balances are shifted from demand to
savings accounts, and consequently is likely to reduce, perhaps
sharply, the rate of growth of M-1 over the QI '78 to QI '79 period;
M-2, on the other hand, is likely to be only marginally affected.
Of course, after automatic transfers are implemented, smaller rates
of growth of measured M-1 will have the same economic and policy
significance as larger rates of growth previously. During the
transition period, however, changes in M-1 will be difficult to
interpret.



-12-

than the staff had previously projected.1 Consequently, the staff

believes that a further increase in deposit rate ceilings on longer-

term certificates will be needed to maintain flows of small-denomination

time deposits, and has assumed such an increase in the fourth quarter.

Even with an increase in ceiling rates, growth in M-3 over the longer-

run policy period may be around the lower end of its 7½ to 10 per cent

range. While growth in small-denomination time and savings deposits

at banks will also remain weak, M-2 expansion is expected to be near

the mid-point of the Committee's longer-run range, reflecting sizable

issuance of time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings.

The slower growth of deposits subject to rate ceilings, and the

resultant increased reliance on managed liabilities and draw-downs

of portfolio liquidity by both banks and thrift institutions, will

be associated with mounting strains on their balance sheet positions.

As the year progresses, therefore, the ability and willingness of

these institutions to meet credit demands can be expected to decline

substantially.

1/ The staff had assumed a 50 basis point increase on all time deposit
ceiling rates.

Directive language

(17) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive.1/ The first formulation, like the

directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-

term rates of growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-

through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. The

second formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions.

In both formulations, variants are shown for particular phrases that

are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in

the preceding section under alternatives A and B.

"Monetary Aggregates" formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in

the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects

the annual growth rates over the [DEL: April-May] MAY-JUNE period to

be within ranges of [DEL: 4 to 8½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and

[DEL: 5½ to 9½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of

the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated

with a weekly-average Federal funds rate

(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) slightly (OR SOMEWHAT) above the current level.

1/ In a memorandum dated May 11 Chairman Miller proposed modified
language for these operational paragraphs and for the preceding
paragraphs dealing with the Committee's general policy stance
and longer-run ranges for the aggregates.



-14-

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears

that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly

from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational

objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an

orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 6¾ to 7½] ____ TO ____ per cent.

In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken

of emerging financial market conditions, including the conditions

in foreign exchange markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks (A) to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or (B) to achieve slightly or

somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear

to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected,

which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks (A) to

maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the

current level (or (B) to increase the weekly-average Federal

funds rate slightly or somewhat from the current level), so



-15-

long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the May-June period

at annual rates within ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and ____

to ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal

weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-

month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the

indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-

average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent. In the conduct

of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging

financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign

exchange markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed

by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting
syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less

borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and

municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.
