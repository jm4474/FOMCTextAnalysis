The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive,

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Interest rates on short-term credit instruments and on

Treasury notes and bonds have moved lower since the September 15 meeting

of the Committee, while yields on corporate and municipal bonds have

changed little on balance under the pressure of a very heavy volume of

new issues. The latest yield on the 3-month Treasury bill was around

5.90 per cent, compared with 6.30 per cent at the time of the meeting.

Other short-term rates, which tend to lag behind bill rates, have drifted

steadily lower, as banks have continued to reduce their borrowings in the

commercial paper market and the GM strike has lessened demands on the

finance paper market.

(2) The Federal funds rate has fluctuated widely since the

last meeting. Immediately following the meeting, an unexpected bulge

in reserve availability pushed the Federal funds rate into the 5-3/4--6 per

cent range and helped give rise to market expectations that the discount

rate was about to be reduced. Most recently, however, trading has taken

place generally in the 6-1/8--6-1/2 per cent range specified in the last

Blue Book. With large and unexpected shifts in market factors affecting

reserves over the last four weeks, net reserves have fluctuated in a

-$500 million to +$25 million range. At the same time, weekly average



-2-

member bank borrowings have ranged from around $400 million to about

$660 million.

(3) The outstanding level of the money supply in September

turned out to be higher than was estimated at the time of the last meeting

mainly as a result of higher-than-expected weekly money supply figures in

the first half of the month. At the moment, the third quarter rate of

expansion in money is 5 per cent corrected for bias (and 5.3 per cent on

a published basis). The adjusted bank credit proxy is estimated to have

grown from August to September and also over the third quarter as a whole

at rates in line with previous Blue Book indications. Banks continued to

run off commercial paper in anticipation of the new reserve requirement,

with the $2.0 billion September decline (September 2-September 30) bringing

the total run-off from the August 17 reserve requirement announcement through
September to
/$3.1 billion. Bank liabilities to their foreign branches dropped by

about $600 million over the four weeks ending September 30 as the widening

spread between Euro-dollars and domestic rates caused banks to reduce their

use of foreign funds, and, in some instances, to allow these deposits to

fall below the reserve free base. These reductions in September in non-

deposit sources of funds were only partially offset by a $1.5 billion in-

crease in CD's over the month. But growth of other time and savings

deposits was very strong in September--at a 14 per cent average annual

rate, close to that in the two previous months taken together.

Prospective developments

(6) If the Committee wishes to continue the policy stance

adopted at the previous meeting, the language incorporated in the second

paragraph of the directive at the last meeting could be continued, with

an amendment to take account of the Treasury financing schedule, as

follows:

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and

moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit

expansion over the months ahead. System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and

money market conditions consistent with that objective,

TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCINGS."

(7) "Moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expansion

over the months ahead" could be interpreted to encompass a 5 per cent annual

rate of growth for the money stock over the fourth quarter. It would appear,

at this point, that such a money growth would be accompanied by around a

9 per cent rate of expansion in the adjusted bank credit proxy. Monthly

paths for money and bank credit consistent with these growth rates are shown

in the table below, along with the associated supply of bank reserves needed

to sustain bank deposits.

1/ For the money supply, the figures in parenthesis represent the unpublished
figures corrected for bias. The quarter-over-quarter money supply growth for

the fourth quarter would be 5 per cent also.

(8) To sustain a 5 per cent growth rate in the money supply over

the fourth quarter may entail some declines in interest rates from current levels

between now and year-end. The economy is expected to be generally sluggish in the

current quarter, partly because of the auto strike and its ramifications, with a

consequent slackening in the transactions needs for cash. Business loan demands

at banks are likely to be sluggish, if the rate of inventory accumulation

declines as expected and as corporations continue to finance heavily in capital

markets partly for debt structure reasons. Under these circumstances, injections

of bank reserves through open market operations to achieve the desired money

growth are likely to be reflected, among other things, in relatively sizable bank

purchases of U.S. Treasury and other market securities. As a result, interest

rates may edge downwards on balance.



(9) The actual movement of short- and long-term rates will

depend in large part on bank liquidity preferences, Treasury financing

strategy, the volume of new corporate and municipal issues, bank loan

demands, and shifts in market expectations. Banks are still likely to

have a general preference for more liquid, short-term instruments.

However, there is some evidence that more banks are beginning to make

longer-term investments in the municipal market; these banks have already

restored some liquidity and may be attracted by wider spreads of long-

term over short-term rates. Moreover, the drop in short-term market

rates has come to make both large CD's and other time deposits seem to

be a more permanent source of funds. Such considerations may encourage

banks to be more willing buyers of a long option in the Treasury's forth-

coming mid-November financing, to be announced on October 22, with books

open in the last week of October.

(10) While it is too early at this writing to be certain about

the form of the forthcoming Treasury financing, it would appear that it

may entail a rights offering of two note issues, plus a cash offering to

cover attrition and whatever additional cash may be desired. The rights

portion would have to be settled on November 16. The cash portion may

be settled on that date, or possibly, if the attrition is low enough, at

a later time; the cash portion could take the form of a bill auction or

perhaps an auction of a short note. In any event, the Treasury will have

to raise some additional cash by early December. During the fourth

quarter, the Treasury is likely to have to raise about $7 billion of net



new cash mainly in the bill area, including additions to the weekly and

monthly bill auctions and the $2-1/2 billion tax bill financing

currently in the market. This may cushion further declines in short-

term rates.

(11) A continuing large calendar of corporate and municipal

issues will tend to inhibit declines in long-term rates. Nevertheless,

investors have shown a desire to lock up high long-term yields--as

indicated by the market absorption of a huge volume of long-term secur-

ities with little upward yield pressure. Thus, the absorption capacity

of the market should tend to offset upward yield pressure from a con-

tinued very large supply of new offerings. And long-term market rates

could work lower if weak loan demand leads to liberalization of bank

lending terms and/or greater bank interest in longer-term securities.

(12) Between now and the next meeting, day-to-day operating

targets for money market conditions designed to lead to injection of

sufficient bank reserves to promote the desired growth path for other

monetary aggregates and lead to some easing of credit market conditions

might include a Federal funds rate in a 6--6-1/2 per cent range, member

bank borrowings averaging around $350-$450 million per week, and net

borrowed reserves in a wide 0-$500 million range. The 3-month bill rate

might be expected to be in a 5-3/4--6-1/8 per cent range.

(13) With the bill rate at this level, banks will be in a

position to obtain large CD's virtually throughout the whole maturity

spectrum, although investor interest in longer-term CD's thus far seems



-9-

quite modest, Also banks may not be as aggressive as in recent months in

the CD area, and offering rates on short CD's have dropped while a few

banks have even reduced offering rates on 3- and 6-month CD's below

ceiling rates. Thus, the rate of increase in time deposits may still be

at about a 22 per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter, although this

is about 10 percentage points less rapid than in the third quarter. Some

of the new bank deposit funds will be used to repay nondeposit sources,

as banks have no further incentive to maintain a high level of borrowing

through the round-about channel of the commercial paper market and as they

react to the unfavorable yield spread of Euro-dollars over CD rates. It

is not clear to what extent banks will take account of yield relationships

in their behavior toward Euro-dollar borrowings, but we have estimated all

outstanding non-deposit funds will drop by about$150 million per week

through mid-November, and by lesser amounts thereafter, thus contributing

to the slower expected growth rate in the adjusted credit proxy for the

fourth quarter as compared with the third.

(14) In October the adjusted credit proxy may rise at about a

7 per cent annual rate, down about 3 percentage points from September,

as shown in the table in paragraph (7). On the other hand, money supply

growth may rebound to around a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate from the 1-1/2

per cent growth rate of September. Both the credit proxy and the money

supply are expected to rise a little more rapidly in November, as the

Treasury financing stimulates some additional credit and money flows.
