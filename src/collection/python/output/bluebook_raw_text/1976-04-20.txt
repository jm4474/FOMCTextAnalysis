The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) M1 increased at about a 6½ per cent annual rate during March.

With incoming data for early April showing further strength, growth for

March and April combined now appears to be running at about a 7¼ per cent

annual rate, as compared with the 6 per cent mid-point of the Committee's

range. Growth in M2 over the March-April period is now projected at nearly

a 10 per cent annual rate, also above the mid-point of the Committee's

range. Inflows to savings accounts at banks, although below the extra-

ordinary February pace, have remained quite strong. Deposit growth at

nonbank thrift institutions also has been well maintained, with March

expansion at S&L's and savings banks combined running close to a 15 per

cent annual rate.

(2) During the intermeeting period, estimates of growth in M1

and M2 for March-April fluctuated around the mid-point of the FOMC's ranges,

and the Desk continued to aim for reserve availability consistent with

Federal funds trading around 4¾ per cent. In the four statement weeks since

the March meeting, excess reserves and member bank borrowing have averaged

$210 million and $50 million, respectively, both somewhat below their recent

levels. Nonborrowed reserves over the March-April period have shown little

net change, as reserves to support M1 and M2 continued to be released by

declines in CD's; in addition, more of the money growth than expected took

the form of currency, which requires no reserves.

(3) With the funds rate remaining stable, short-term interest

rates have dropped back to levels reached in mid-January, when the funds

rate first moved down into the 4¾ per cent range. These declines, together

with the relatively favorable performance of the wholesale and consumer

price indexes, have contributed to a further strengthening of investor

demands for longer-term investments. Since the last FOMC meeting, bond

yields have declined another 15 to 40 basis points despite the heavy recent

volume of new issues. In mortgage markets, rates have declined 5-10 basis

points further.

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(5) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary

aggregates are shown below for Committee consideration. They pertain to the

one year period from QI '76 to QI '77. The ranges shown under alternative B

are the same as those adopted in January for the QIV '75-QIV '76 period.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

M1 5½-8½ 4½-7½ 3½-6½

M2 9-12 7¾-10¾ 6-9

M3  10-13 9-12 7½-10½

Proxy 7-10 6-9 5-8

(6) In considering these alternative longer-run targets, the

Committee may be interested in their relationship to the QIV '76 levels for

the monetary aggregates that were implied by the mid-points of the ranges

adopted in January. From the fourth quarter of '75 to first quarter of '76,

M2 and M3 expanded at annual rates very near the mid-points of the ranges

adopted previously (and shown above under alternative B); thus, continuation

of growth near these rates would be associated with QIV '76 levels close to

those implied by the earlier targets. However, M1 growth from the fourth

to first quarter--at a 2.9 per cent annual rate--was well below both the

lower limit of the longer-run range and the 6 per cent mid-point of

that range. To achieve the level in QIV '76 implied by the mid-point of the

earlier range, M1 would have to grow at almost a 7 per cent annual rate over

the last three quarters of this year. Assuming M1 growth returns to a 6 per

cent annual rate in the first quarter of 1977, this would imply a growth rate

for the new one-year target period QI '76-QI '77 of about 6¾ per cent--well

within the ranges of alternatives A and B and a shade above the upper limit

of alternative C.

(7) Short-run operating strategies roughly corresponding to the

longer-run ranges are suggested below:

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Ranges for April-May 1/

M1  5½-9½ 5-9 4½-8½

M2 9½-13½ 8½-12½ 8-12

Federal funds rate 3¾-4¾ 4¼-¼ 4¾-5¾
(intermeeting range)

(8) The Federal funds rate range of alternative B is centered

on the recently prevailing 4¾ per cent level. Given the bulge in M1 in

early April, we expect that such a funds rate would be accompanied by M1

growth in a 5-9 per cent, annual rate, range over the April-May period.

With expansion in time and savings deposits other than large CD's remaining

relatively strong, M2 growth over the same period is likely to be in an

8½-12½ per cent annual rate range.

(9) M1 growth has been generally strengthening in recent months.

Part of the expansion in recent weeks may be attributable to declining

Treasury deposits, but on balance it seems likely that a somewhat more

typical relationship between M1 and GNP is being re-established. We would

expect M1 to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate from the first to second

quarter. The staff expects that interest rates will soon have to begin

1/ Reserve aggregates thought to be consistent with these ranges are
shown in appendix table V.



rising if growth over the one-year QI '76-QI '77 period is to be constrained

to 6 per cent--the mid-point of the longer-run growth range of alternative B.

Our projected Federal funds rate patterns through the first quarter of 1977

for all alternatives are shown in appendix table IV. Under alternative B,

the funds rate is expected to reach the 7 per cent level by early next

year.

(10) If the funds rate stays around the mid-point of its

alternative B range over the next four weeks, short- and longer-term interest

rates are unlikely to change significantly. On April 28, the Treasury will

be announcing its mid-May refunding of some $4 billion of publicly-held

maturing debt. The Treasury may also raise about $1 -2 billion of new cash

at the same time. It is possible that a longer-term bond as well as a note

in the 7-10 year maturity area may be included in the offering. While the

volume of corporate and municipal bond offerings appears to be dropping

off from its exceptional March pace, the forward calendar remains high,

and substantial longer-term offerings by the Treasury could exert some

upward pressure on bond yields.

(11) Alternative C contemplates a gradual tightening of the

money market over the next four weeks to the mid-point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent

funds rate range in the process of moving toward lower longer-run growth

rates for the aggregates. In the short-run, however, the impact on M1

and M2 probably would be no more than minor because member banks would

respond to the reduced availability of nonborrowed reserves contemplated

under this alternative by increasing their borrowing. It is possible,



though, that a substantial upward adjustment in the Treasury bill and other

short-term rates would occur in response to signs of a sustained upward

movement in the funds rate. Under these conditions, if short-rates moved

well above the 5 per cent passbook ceiling rate, there could be sizable

outflows of interest-sensitive funds from savings accounts, particularly those

held by businesses and State and local governments. This would tend to drop

the rate of growth in M2 toward the bottom of the indicated April-May range.

(12) Under alternative C, we expect that interest rates would

have to rise considerably further to achieve a 5 per cent M1 growth from

QI '76 to QI '77. By early 1977, the funds rate might be around 7¾ per

cent.

(13) Under alternative A, the mid-point of the longer-run growth

target for M1 is 7 per cent. In order to achieve this more rapid growth,

money market conditions would probably have to ease somewhat over the

next few weeks, and the funds rate would probably remain below 5 per

cent until well into the summer months. Thereafter, however, interest

rates would need to rise, with the Federal funds rate probably reaching

the 6 per cent area in early 1977. Given the expected pattern of market

interest rates, interest-bearing deposits would likely remain quite strong

into the third quarter, but inflows would begin to slow later on as rates

on market instruments became more attractive.

(14) Over the period immediately ahead, internal funds available

to the business sector are expected to remain quite ample relative to



-8-

requirements generated by inventory and capital investment, so that little

pick-up in business short-term credit demands is anticipated. As expenditures

continue to rise, though, businesses later this year are expected to turn

increasingly to commercial banks and the paper market for funds. Under

alternatives A and B, banks are likely to have sufficient funds available

without reliance on significant increases in CD's. But under alternative

C limited fund flows by late this year could induce banks to rely

appreciably more on sales of CD's to satisfy credit demands.



Proposed directive

(15) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in terms

of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and are intended

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed in the event that the

Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of money market con-

ditions and wishes to maintain the conditions now prevailing. Since the

last meeting, exchange market conditions have tended to become stable,

although the pound and the lira remain subject to particular uncer-

tainties. Therefore, in all alternatives, we propose deleting the

specific reference to "the sensitive state of foreign exchange markets"

that was inserted at the last meeting, and restoring the previously long-

standing reference to international financial markets.

Alternative "Monetary Aggregates" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL: and the sensitive

state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]

SUBSTANTIAL growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.



-10-

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL; and the sensitive

state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL; and the sensitve

state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]

MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

'Money Market" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL: and the sensitive

state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to [DEL: achieve]

MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: consistent

with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the period ahead,

PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE

RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
