CONFIDENTIAL (FR) August 8, 1969.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) Major deposit and reserve aggregates contracted signifi-

cantly further in July, and interest rates remained generally at high

levels. Most recently, however, both short- and long-term rates have

turned down, as signs of more moderate credit demands have developed in

some sectors and market opinion that the peak in yields may have passed

has strengthened somewhat. Final action on the income surtax--at least

for the calendar 1969 segment--contributed to this changed expectation.

Also, markets were generally strengthened by the Treasury's decision to

follow a conservative approach in its August refinancing. Yields on

longer-tern debt securities have declined 1/8 - 1/4 of a percentage

point from their recent highs; and short-term rates--apart from day-to-

day money rates--are generally down 1/8 - 1/2 of a percentage point from

theirs.

(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate rose to a peak of around

7.20 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the Treasury's July tax-bill

financing. Since then, it has declined, and in the first week of August

fluctuated around 7 per cent. Demands for Treasury bills have been quite

strong. Reinvestment of funds released through retirement of the maturing

CCC special certificates has recently contributed to these demands, along

with stepped-up cash flows to the auto companies during the early part of

the model change-over period. With market anticipations of somewhat lower



-2-

rates tending to strengthen, the 7.82 per cent yield set by the Treasury

on the single (18 month) note offered in the August refinancing proved

to be highly attractive.

(3) In the latter part of July, the tendency for rates in

securities markets to edge down was abetted by a coincident easing of

day-to-day money market rates. In the two weeks following the last

Committee meeting, the effective rate on Federal funds averaged around

8-1/4 per cent, substantially below the 9 to 9-1/4 per cent average for

the three preceding statement weeks. This moderation of pressures on

Federal funds reflected a skewing of reserve distribution in favor of

banks at money centers. At New York City banks, in particular, the

basic reserve deficit dropped to a very low average level. Since the

end of July, however, day-to-day money rates have tightened, raising the

average effective rate on Federal funds to more than 9-1/2 per cent; and

in recent days trading has frequently been at 10 per cent or above. The

reasons behind this firming are not entirely clear. It is possible that

recent Federal Reserve regulatory actions and administrative pressures

on repetitive borrowers at the discount window may have increased demand

for Federal funds at a time when country bank reserve positions have come

under increased pressure as a result of widespread deposit losses.

(4) Net borrowed reserves of member banks in the last 3

statement weeks have averaged about $1.0 billion, little changed from

the preceding 3-week period. Average member bank borrowings from the

Federal Reserve dropped slightly to $1.2 billion in the latest period.

But borrowings by country banks have risen by about $100 million between

the two periods to an average of about $660 million, as monetary restraint

has spread more widely.



-3-

(5) The recent declines in security market rates occurred

despite a sharp further contraction of commercial bank deposits during

July. This shrinkage continued to center on large time CD's, which

dropped by $1.8 billion. But attrition also persisted in other time and

savings deposits, as the still high market rates continued to stimulate

further savings withdrawals during the post-interest crediting period.

Reflecting in part transfers out of U.S. Government deposits, the money

supply rose at a 6 per cent annual rate in July, after correcting for the

bias introduced by the deduction of cash items associated with the in-

creasing volume of Euro-dollar transactions. The upward adjustment for

July was around 2-1/2 percentage points. In the second quarter, the

money supply growth rate has been revised upward by 2 percentage points

to a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate. Upward revisions in the rate of change

of total member bank deposits will be much less marked because of the

larger total amount of such deposits.

(6) Reflecting the heavy time deposit contraction of July,

total member bank deposits are estimated to have declined at a 21.5 per

cent annual rate, substantially more than was projected four weeks ago.

Similarly, total reserves declined during July at a nearly 30 per cent

annual rate. Adjustment of the deposit data for Euro-dollar borrowings

from foreign branches lessened the decline in the adjusted proxy to a

13.5 per cent annual rate. This compares with a decline of 5 - 8 per cent

projected in the last Blue Book.

(7) With Euro-dollar borrowings thur offsetting only a part

of the further shrinkage in bank deposits, major money market banks con-

tinued to move aggressively to attract funds from other non-deposit

sources. It is estimates these non-deposit sources in July rose by



-4-

about the equivalent of 4 - 5 percentage points on the proxy, or somewhat

more than earlier anticipated. This includes borrowings by head offices

of banks through repurchase agreements and through funds obtained outside

the U.S. (other than from branches), and by affiliates through issuance

of commercial paper.

deposit and reserve aggregates for the last half of 1968 and thus far

Prospective developments

(9) After taking account of the relatively wide range of

fluctuation in the Federal funds rate over the past four weeks, maintenance

of prevailing firm conditions in the money market may be considered to

entail a Federal funds rate averaging around 9 per cent, member bank

borrowings in a $1 - $1-1/2 billion range, and net borrowed reserves

around $1 billion. However, the relationships that actually develop

between the Federal funds rate and marginal reserve measures (as well as

between these and credit conditions more generally) will depend in part

on how banks adjust to the new Federal Reserve regulations as they become

effective. In view of the highly concentrated impact of these regulations

on a relatively few banks, it seems likely that these banks will increase

their demands on the Federal funds market, and also at times the discount

window. The redefinition of instruments to be classed as deposits subject

to reserves to include bills payable and London drafts has already become

effective. The exemption for loans sold under repurchase agreements from

Regulations Q and D will be phasing out. Final action has not yet been

taken on Euro-dollar reserve requirements and the proposed more restricted

definition of Federal funds transactions.

(10) The redefinition of deposits to include such items as

bills payable and London checks is expected to increase required reserves

in the week ending August 20 by about $450 million. This redefinition

has probably contributed to the recent lessening of pressure on short-

term Euro-dollar rates. With respect to repurchase agreements, all



-6-

outstanding agreements written after July 25 will become subject to

Regulations Q and D on August 28. It is not expected that there will

be much if any of the newly written RP's outstanding after late August

(and thus no significant increase in required reserves). However

that may be, banks' behavior toward alternative sources of funds and

their own loans and investments is probably already in the process of

change in view of the prospective decline in RP's against loans as a

continuing source of funds; about $1.3 billion of such RP's sold to

nonbanks were outstanding toward the end of July and will run off over

time, tending to reduce bank credit by an equivalent amount. Moreover,

the proposed changes with respect to Euro-dollars and Federal funds,

while not yet effective, may have already begun to have a marginal impact

on bank attitudes.

(11) If money market conditions are not to be allowed to

tighten, one would expect open market operations to accommodate the

increase in required reserves generated by these recent regulatory

changes. Even if reserves are provided in full, however, there will

still be some reduction of commercial bank liquidity (even assuming

that the level of bank deposits is unaffected by the increased cost of

funds to banks) as banks in effect exchange earning assets with the

Federal Reserve for the needed reserves. In light of this, and taking

into account the erosion of RP's as a source of funds, it might be

necessary to supply reserves in a slightly higher than a one-for-one

ratio if increased tensions in bank financing positions are to be avoided.



-7-

(12) Apart from technical operations to accommodate required

reserves, it is not clear how active System open market operations will

have to be if the Federal funds rate is to be below the 9-1/2 - 10-1/2

per cent range of recent days. In part, this will depend on the extent

to which individual banks become more willing to borrow from the discount

window in adjusting to new regulations. Any such increase in borrowing,

however, should only be temporary, assuming continued normal operation of

the window, and would likely be accompanied by strong demands for Federal

funds. Under the circumstances, if over-all credit conditions are not

to become more restrictive, it is probable that some moderation in the

recent downward pressure on total and nonborrowed reserves will be

needed. And, assuming banks do not become fundamentally more able or

willing to borrow at the discount window, it may well be that net borrowed

reserves and member bank borrowings will have to be toward the low end

of the ranges specified in paragraph (9) for the over-all constellation

of money market conditions to remain about unchanged on balance.

(13) Against the background of the money market conditions

and factors affecting them described in the preceding paragraphs, the

3-month bill rate may continue in a 6-3/4 - 7-1/4 per cent range over

the next four weeks. Some upward pressure on the bill rate may be

generated by bank adjustments to the new regulations, by further offer-

ings of Federal Agency issues, and by the expected Treasury cash

offering in late August. But System operations, as noted earlier, may



-8-
offset some of these pressures. As to the cash offering, it is

expected to be quite moderate in size (perhaps around $1-1/2 - $2

billion) and in the Treasury bill area. A basic factor influencing bill

rates, as well as longer-term rates, over the next few weeks will be the

state of market expectations. If tentative recent attitudes to the

effect that market interest rates are beginning to turn down become

stronger, it is likely that dealers will be willing to build up positions

and thereby provide some downward impetus to interest rates. These

attitudes, however, will be importantly influenced by dealer financing

costs, which have recently risen, as well as by the fundamental economic

outlook.

(14) Given continuance of the current relatively high

structure of market interest rates and taut lending conditions at banks,

the recent pattern of sluggish loan growth at banks is likely to continue.

In part, this would appear to reflect supply constraints. But it may

also be a harbinger of cyclical reductions in demand, assuming that

business corporations have about passed through the recent phase of

rapid expansion in capital outlays.

and
(15) With both demand/supply factors holding down loan

growth, demand deposits are likely to contract in a 3 - 6 per cent,

annual rate, range in August. The money stock will probably decline

in a 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate range as currency in circulation



-9-

continues to grow.1/ U.S. Government deposits are also expected to

decline somewhat on average.

(16) Market interest rates will continue to exert a strong

pull on CD's and other time and savings deposits at banks. Consumer-

type time deposits are not expected to show any very significant recovery

from the large July net outflow. And attrition of CD's in August is

likely to continue given present ceiling rates, although slowing to

about $1 billionas amounts maturing are reduced.

(17) Member bank deposits will continue to decline relatively

sharply in August, though the decline should be considerably less than

that of July, and total reserves outstanding will also be reduced. The

decline in total member bank deposits may be in a 10 - 13 per cent,

annual rate, range. Euro-dollar borrowings through branches are not

expected to show much buoyancy, and may add about a percentage point

or so to member bank deposits in the absence of any major change in the

supply of funds abroad. The behavior of nondeposit sources of funds is

quite conjectural. Some, such as loan RP's, are likely to be contracting

fairly sharply as the month progresses. But issuance of commercial paper

by affiliates of banks is likely to continue, with the rapidity of the

increase depending in part on the intensity and incidence of credit

demands. All in all, however, we do not believe that the total of non-

deposit sources will rise as rapidly in August as in July.

1/ Figures projected for August for the money stock, total member
bank deposits, and reserve aggregates take into account revisions
resulting from the redefinition of deposits.



-10-

A Policy Alternative

(18) If the Committee wishes to consider somewhat less

restrictive money market conditions as a policy alternative, such

conditions might include a Federal funds rate fluctuating around 8-1/2 per

cent, member bank borrowings ranging between $900 million and $1.1 billion,

and net borrowed reserves in a range $100 - $200 million lower. The

persistence of such money market conditions may be expected to tilt market

expectations toward further anticipation of lower interest rates in the

future. And as dealers and others become more willing to position

securities, both short- and long-term interest rates are likely to

decline. But given the extent to which banks will have to adjust to

new regulatory provisions, the decline in short-term interest rates may

be of relatively modest proportions. Still, the 3-month bill rate may

move down into a 6-1/2 - 6-7/8 per cent range.

(19) The market interest rate movement anticipated with a

modest easing of money market conditions is not likely to proceed to

the point where time deposits at banks become significantly more

competitive under existing Regulation Q ceilings. Thus CD attrition

in August is not likely to slow more than noted earlier. And there is

little reason to expect a significant growth pattern to develop in other

time deposits. Nor is the money supply likely to show appreciably

greater strength. The additional reserves provided through nonborrowed

reserves to attain the alternative money market conditions are likely to

be partly absorbed by reduced member bank borrowing, with a resulting



-11-

relatively small net effect on total reserves or on deposits--perhaps,

say, a percentage point or so.

(20) To have a significant effect on deposits would probably

require a change in Regulation Q ceilings and/or some further easing

of money market conditions over time. As the market became more

certain of the course of monetary policy, individual banks would be

encouraged to re-enter the securities market, thus tending to generate

new deposit balances at declining market interest rates. Time deposits

would become more competitive. The demand for money should also tend

to increase as interest rates go down, but this effect might well be

outweighed by a weakening in transactions demand for cash if growth in

GNP slows further as expected.

NOTE: The attached tables and charts have not been corrected for the bias
introduced by the deduction of cash items associated with the increased
volume of Euro-dollar transactions. The necessary data to do so was only
available at the last minute and revised figures were incorporated in the
text.

Explanation of Projections in Table 6

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and maintenance of Treasury balances with Federal Reserve
at $1.9 billion, thereafter.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $-0.7 billion, August 1; $-0.5 billion, August 15;
$2.0 billion, August 27.
