Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) M1 expanded at an annual rate of about 7 per cent in February,

and recent data suggest a roughly similar growth rate for March. For the

two-month target period, M 1 thus appears to be growing at a rate in the

upper half of the Committee's range of tolerance, as shown in the table.

Growth of M2 for the February-March period appears to be running at an

annual rate of about 9 per cent or ½ percentage point above the upper limit

of its range of tolerance, as time deposits other than money market CD's

expanded more rapidly than expected in February. Recent growth of both M 1

and M2 may have been bolstered to some extent by unusually large Federal

income tax refunds in February.

(2) Continued weak loan demand, together with the more rapid

growth of demand and other time deposits, permitted banks to reduce

reliance on nondeposit sources of funds and to let CD's run off. As

a result, the bank credit proxy is now expected to show a slight con-

traction, on average,over the February-March period.

(3) During the inter-meeting period, the Account Manager sought

reserve conditions that would be consistent with a gradual easing of the

Federal funds rate to around 5¾ per cent, the mid-point of the 5¼-6¾ per

cent range agreed upon by the Committee at the February meeting. The

Account Manager's task was complicated, however, by the unexpectedly large

volume of nonborrowed reserves being released by pre-tax-date attrition in

the Treasury's cash balance at Reserve banks. The balance dropped from

about $3¾ billion in late February to an overdraft position of more than

$1 billion last Wednesday. In the most recent statement week, the drop

in the balance exceeded expectations. As a result, despite $4.6 billion

of matched sale-purchase transactions arranged by the Desk on Tuesday

and Wednesday, the average Federal funds rate fell to just under 4 per

cent on the final day of the statement week, reducing the weekly average

to only 5.44 per cent. Because of repeated Desk actions to absorb reserves thus

far in March, and market awareness of reserve management problems arising from

the squeeze on Treasury cash prior to mid-March tax receipts, this latest

drop in the funds rate has not been generally interpreted as a signal of

further policy easing.



-3-

(4) Short-term market interest rates have shown mixed changes

since the February FOMC meeting. While private short-term rates have

dropped on balance by about 25 basis points--in response to the further

decline of the Federal funds rate--Treasury bill yields have risen 10-20

basis points, with the 3-month issue trading most recently around 5.40

per cent. The general slowing of declines in short-term rates has been

attributable in large measure to market expectations that the recent

pick-up in growth of the monetary aggregates may constrain further

declines in the funds rate. The continuing weakness in loan demand and

relatively low level of short-term rates has, nevertheless, induced most

large banks to reduce their prime lending rates to 8 per cent, and

several banks have moved to 7¾ per cent--the lowest level since June 1973.

(5) Bond yields have backed up as much as 40 basis points

during the inter-meeting period, reflecting the continued heavy volume of

new issues, and the apparent loss of downward momentum in short-term

rates. While yields on new corporate bonds resisted the general advance

for a time, most recently they too have shown substantial upward adjust-

ments. A special factor influencing municipal yields in the period was

increased investor caution emanating from the continuing financing problems

of New York City and the special difficulties of the New York State Urban

Development Corporation. Treasury yields were affected by the Treasury's

February 24 announcement of financing plans that involved about $7 billion

of new money to be raised by mid-April through five separate auctions of

coupon issues. Although the volume of money to be raised came as no great

surprise to the market, the exclusive focus on coupon issues was not anti-

cipated. The first two auctions--involving $1¾ billion of 6-year 8-month

notes, and $1½ billion of 14-month notes--have just been completed and



-4-

attracted good bidding interest. As a result, yields on longer-term

Treasury issues have recently stabilized.

(6) Savings inflows to nonbank thrift institutions showed

additional strength in February, as market rates declined and Federal

income tax refunds exceeded usual proportions. The thrift institutions

have used these improved flows largely to rebuild liquidity and pay down

borrowings. However, conditions in mortgage markets have recently shown

further improvement; non-rate terms on mortgages reportedly have eased

somewhat, and average rates on conventional mortgages at selected S&L's

edged down to about 9 per cent in early March--20 basis points below

early February and roughly 100 basis points below last fall's peak.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of changes) selected monetary and financing flows over

various recent time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply

growth rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed

on a last-month-of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases

are shown in Appendix table IV for the alternatives presented in the

next section.

growth in M1 at a 6 per cent annual rate over the first nine months of the

year. This implies, as is shown, an 8 per cent annual rate of growth over the

forthcoming 7 month period from February to September. Growth rates in

the other monetary aggregates are somewhat larger than the earlier speci-

fications because of shifting relationships among the various forms of

liquid assets.

(10) Under alternative A, a further decline in the Federal

funds rate to around 5 per cent--the mid-point of the 4½-5½ per cent

range shown--would be anticipated over the next few weeks. This reflects

staff expectations of continued near-term weakness in economic activity

and in the transactions demand for money during the second quarter. There-

after, without any further decline in the Federal funds rate, the sharp

rebound in economic activity projected for the third quarter is expected

to lead to a rapid rate of growth in M1 during the summer--large enough

to bring growth for the first nine months of the year up to a 6 per cent

annual rate. Given the rapid summer growth needed to attain a 6 per cent

rate over the nine month period, the funds rate and other interest rates

would likely need to rise fairly sharply in the late summer and fall if

the Committee wishes to maintain M1 growth in the period after September

at around the 6 per cent annual rate.

(11) Consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and

thrift institutions would also be likely to expand somewhat more rapidly

than in recent months under alternative A, given the further decline in

market interest rates that is assumed. Meanwhile, banks may continue to

let large CD's run-off, at least until around mid-year, reflecting the

weakness in private credit demands, cautious bank management attitudes,

and the increased availability of demand deposits as well as other time

deposits. As a result, broader monetary aggregates excluding large



-8-

CD's (M2 and M3) would be expected to show more rapid growth over the

next few months than their counterparts including large CD's (M2 and M4,

respectively).

(12) Alternative B shows the pattern of monetary aggregates

that would be associated with little change in money market conditions

from those recently prevailing. The Federal funds rate range centers

on 5¾ per cent. Growth rates in key monetary aggregates would, of course,

be slower than under alternative A--as indexed by a 7 per cent annual

growth rate in M1 over the seven month February-September period and

a 5¼ per cent growth rate over the first nine months of the year.

(13) Market interest rates probably would rise somewhat over

the weeks ahead under alternative B. The Treasury will continue to raise

sizable amounts of new cash, including continued cash additions to weekly

bill auctions, and dealer positions in Treasury issues are relatively

high. Moreover, the calendar of new corporate and municipal issues

remains exceptionally large. Stabilization of the funds rate around

5 per cent would likely be taken by the market as evidence that the

Federal Reserve was no longer seeking actively to ease credit markets.

Thus, unless the economy turned out to be considerably weaker than currently

projected, the weight of Treasury and corporate long-term credit demands

would tend to exert upward pressure on market rates.

(14) Upward interest rate pressures would nonetheless be

limited by maintenance of the funds rate at the 5¾ per cent level. That

rate is still below rates on short-term market instruments other than

Treasury bills. With upward rate pressures limited, inflows of consumer-

type time and savings deposits to banks and thrift institutions would

probably be well maintained. Thus, mortgage market conditions would



-9-

continue to ease, and bank prime loan rates might drop a little further,

particularly since most banks are still at 8 per cent or above.

(15) Alternative C indicates growth paths for the monetary

aggregates intended to be consistent with some tightening of money market

conditions over the weeks ahead, A rise in the funds rate back above

6 per cent--as is contemplated in this alternative--would very likely

initiate a sharp upward adjustment in yields on Treasury securities and

a turn-around, though perhaps less marked, in other market rates. Upward

rate pressures might be fairly severe for a time in corporate and municipal

bond markets, in view of the large volume of new issues currently over-

hanging the market and the possibility that investors would hold back

pending clarification of Federal Reserve intentions. With market interest

rates rising, the rate of growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits

at banks and thrift institutions would begin to diminish. And with the

change in prospects for savings inflows, mortgage market conditions would

not be likely to ease much, if any, further.

(16) Turning to the behavior of M1 in the March-April period,

expansion is indicated to be in a 4½-6½ per cent range, given prevailing

money market conditions (typified by a 5¾ per cent funds rate) as called

for by alternative B. Near-term growth, of course, would be somewhat more

rapid under the easier money market conditions of alternative A and some-

what less rapid under the tighter conditions of alternative C. Money growth

rates, in general, are expected to accelerate by early summer when tax

rebates are added to the public's cash and time deposit holdings (assuming

prompt passage of a tax reduction bill). And, as noted earlier, trans-

actions demands for cash balances are likely to intensify in summer as



-10-

GNP strengthens. We would expect that the acceleration in money growth

would be relatively modest under alternative C, however, since rising

interest rates would be working to restrain money demand.

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the

Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with SUBSTANTIALLY more rapid growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred

in recent months.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead than has occurred in recent months.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the

Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with SOMEWHAT more rapid growth in

monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred

in recent months.
