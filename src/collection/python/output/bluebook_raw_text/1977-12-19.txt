Recent developments

(1) M-1 declined at a 1.8 per cent annual rate in November,

following its sharp advance in October. With growth apparently resuming

in December, M-1 is projected to increase at a 2 per cent annual rate

over November and December, 1 percentage point above the lower end of

its FOMC range. Expansion in M-2 also weakened significantly in

November and for November-December is projected at an annual rate of

6 per cent, also about 1 percentage point above the lower end of its

range. Growth in the interest-bearing component of M-2 has remained

relatively strong in recent weeks, reflecting a sharp rise in the large

denomination time deposits included in this measure. Balances in small

time and savings deposit accounts, on the other hand, are estimated

to have declined somewhat in November, apparently in lagged response

to the rise in market interest rates that occurred in late summer and

early fall. Inflows to deposit accounts at nonbank thrift institutions

also weakened markedly in November.

(2) Throughout the period since the November 15 FOMC meeting,

projections of growth rates of the key monetary aggregates for the

November-December period have been well within the ranges specified

by the Committee. Accordingly, the Account Management has continued

to aim for reserve conditions consistent with Federal funds trading

around 6½ per cent.

(3) Total reserves are projected to expand at a moderate

5 per cent annual rate over the November-December period. Nonborrowed

reserves, however, are expected to rise at an 18 per cent annual rate,

reflecting the substantial decline in member bank borrowing over the

past several weeks. In response to the October 26 increase in the

discount rate, member bank borrowing from Federal Reserve Banks dropped

from the average October level of $1.3 billion to an average of about

$550 million in the first two weeks of December.

(4) In addition to the sizable increase in large denomination

time deposits included in M-2, negotiable CD's at weekly reporting

banks also expanded sharply further in November. Together, the

increase in both forms of large denomination time deposits amounted

to a record $9½ billion, substantially greater than October's

relatively large increase of just over $5 billion. Banks have been

issuing substantial volumes of such instruments recently in order to

raise funds to meet strong credit demands at a time when flows into

demand and other time and savings deposits have been weak.



-3-

(5) The substantial further rise in bank credit in November

was concentrated in loan portfolios, as continued liquidation of

Treasury securities more than offset a further rise in other security

holdings. Business loans again expanded at a rapid pace, and gains

in mortgages and consumer loans are also estimated to have been quite

large. The advance in business loans--which apparently occurred at

both large and small banks--extends the more rapid upward trend observ-

able since around mid-year.

(6) With the Federal funds rate remaining essentially

unchanged and published data indicating that growth in the aggregates

was weakening significantly, most market participants appear to have

concluded that the System would not change its funds rate target over

the remainder of this year. Against this background, the general level

of short-term interest rates has remained essentially unchanged. How-

ever, some minor realignments in relationships among individual rates

have occurred: rates on private short-term instruments have edged a

bit higher, apparently in response to the large volume of bank CD's being

offered, while Treasury bill rates have edged down somewhat, reflect-

ing, in part, the impact of substantial foreign central bank acquisi-

tions of these securities.

(7) In longer-term markets, on the other hand, yields have

generally moved somewhat higher. The increase in longer-term yields

appears to reflect in part an upward revision in interest rate projec-

tions for next year, as market participants apparently have interpreted



-4-

recently published data, such as the upward revision in third quarter

GNP and the November rise in employment, as indicating stronger than

previously anticipated economic activity in prospect for next year.

In addition, market expectations may have been influenced by larger

than anticipated Treasury borrowing in recent weeks, as well as by

increased prospects for a tax cut in 1978.

percentage annual rate of change) related monetary and financial

flows over various time periods.

Prospective developments

(9) The table below presents, for the Committee's con-

sideration, three alternative sets of specifications for the monetary

aggregates and the Federal funds rate for the forthcoming inter-

meeting period. (More detailed and longer-term data for the aggregates

are shown in the tables on pp. 7 and 8).

Ranges for December-January

M-1 4 to 10 3½ to 9½ 3 to 9

M-2 6½ to 10½ 6 to 10 5½ to 9½

Federal funds rate 5¾ to 6¼ 6¼ to 6¾ 6¾ to 7¼
(Inter-meeting period)

(10) In view of the underlying strength of the economy, it

is unlikely that the weakness in M-1 behavior in November will persist.

Given projections of nominal GNP, money demand can be expected to be

relatively strong over the months ahead as the restraining effect of

the 1 to 2 percentage point rise in short rates since last spring

wears off. While the growth in GNP will probably generate less demand

for money than historical relationships would suggest, it appears likely,

on the basis of recent experience, that demand will be stronger relative

to economic activity than was the case in 1975 and 1976.

(11) Against that background, M-1 growth is likely to pick

up in the December-January period. Given the Federal funds rate assump-

tions of alternative B--where the rate is centered at the prevailing

level of 6-1/2 per cent--M-1 growth over this period is likely to be

in a 3-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent annual rate range. If the staff's December

projection of 6 per cent annual rate of increase in M-1 proves correct,

growth in the fourth quarter would be at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate,

significantly below the rates of growth for the second and third

quarters. For the year 1977 (measured from QIV '76 to QIV '77) M-1

would grow at around a 7-1/4 per cent rate.

(12) Growth in M-2 over the December-January period is likely

to be in a 6-10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.

Commercial bank savings deposits, after contracting in November, are

likely to resume modest growth over the period, even though market

yields will remain above rate ceilings on such deposits, as the most

interest sensitive holders have probably shifted to other instruments.

Small denomination time deposits with maturities in excess of 4 years,

whose rates are still above those on marketable securities of com-

parable maturity, are also expected to grow moderately in the December-

January period. As in October-November, however, most of the expansion

in the interest bearing component of M-2 is likely to occur in large

denomination time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings.

(13) At thrift institutions, inflows over the months ahead

are likely to remain well below the unusually rapid pace of July-

October, when these institutions were apparently successful in capturing

a substantial volume of maturing wild card deposits from commercial banks.

Saving deposits at S&L's and MSB's have already slowed considerably in

reflection of the higher level of market yields, but longer-term deposits

at these institutions, where offering rates remain above market yields,

can be expected to grow at a relatively rapid pace in December-January.

While thrift institutions have only limited ability to supplement



-10-

deposit flows with ceiling-free large denomination deposits, they

appear to be in a position to fulfill their record level of mortgage

commitments by reducing liquid asset holdings and continuing to draw

on FHLB advances.

(14) If the Federal funds rate remains near its present

6 per cent level over the inter-meeting period, as envisioned under

alternative B, short-term rates probably will remain fairly

near their current levels. Credit demands are not likely to exert

upward pressures on short-term rates in the weeks immediately ahead.

The Treasury is not expected to expand the supply of bills until late

January or early February. In private short-term markets, banks are

likely to issue a sizable amount of new large, negotiable CD's in

coming weeks, though the amount issued will probably drop below

the exceptional volume of the fourth quarter, as other deposit

inflows pick-up somewhat and loan demands moderate.

(15) Over the longer-run, however, short-term rates can be

expected to rise further. Given the 11 per cent increase in nominal GNP

projected for the first three quarters of 1978, further increases in

interest rates seem required to restrain M-1 growth during that period

to about the 4¾ per cent annual rate necessary to achieve the mid-

point of the Committee's longer-run range of 4-6½ per cent for the

QIII '77-QIII '78 period. The Federal funds rate may have to begin

rising around mid-January and reach a level of about 7¾ per cent by

spring, as shown in Appendix I. This would probably be accompanied by



-11-

a rise of 1½ percentage points or so in other short rates and of about

a ½ percentage point in bond yields. Mortgage rates may rise somewhat

less, given prospective Federal support programs.

(16) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal

funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range between now

and mid-January. With additional monetary restraint in place sooner,

the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to be some-

what slower over the next few months than under alternative B. Con-

sequently, interest rates would have to rise somewhat less next year

in order to achieve the mid-points of the Committee's longer-run ranges

for the QIII '77-QIII '78 period.

(17) In light of the recent moderation in the growth of the

monetary aggregates, an increase in the Federal funds rate to the

7 per cent mid-point of the alternative C range over the next few weeks

would probably surprise market participants and involve a substantial

upward adjustment in short rates--with the 3-month bill rate, for

example, rising to about 6½ per cent. Longer-term rates would also

probably be subject to upward pressures, but the large volume of invest-

ible funds from insurance companies and pension funds would very likely

restrain the net increase in such rates. Member bank borrowing from

the discount window would rise substantially, and pressure for another

increase in the discount rate would develop.

(18) An easing in the Federal funds rate to 6 per cent, as

envisioned under alternative A, could stimulate a substantial downward

adjustment in short-term market rates. However, the lower level of



-12-

rates could not be maintained for long if growth in the aggregates

is to be held within the Committee's longer-run ranges. Thus,

interest rates would soon need to begin rising, and would reach levels

next year higher than those necessary under alternatives B and C.

Under alternative A, M-1 is likely to expand at a 6¼ per cent average

rate of growth over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of

1978, requiring interest rate increases sufficient to hold M-1 growth

in the second and third quarters of 1978 to about a 4 per cent annual

rate. The projected Federal funds rate pattern to achieve such a

slowdown calls for an increase to around 8¼ per cent in the third

quarter of 1978. Such rate levels would likely warrant consideration

of adjustments to Regulation Q ceilings by next summer.



-13-

Directive language

(19) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation places main

emphasis on near-term rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The

second formulation, like the directive adopted at the last meeting,

places main emphasis on money market conditions; it shows--in strike-

through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. As

suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines

of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions

sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for some-

what easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--

are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in

the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the

annual growth rates over the December-January period to be

within the ranges of ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and

____ to ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee

such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-

average Federal funds rate of about ____ per cent. If, giving

approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that



-14-

growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly

from the mid-points of the indicated ranges, the operational

objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an

orderly fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.

IN THE CONDUCT OF DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS, ACCOUNT SHALL BE

TAKEN OF EMERGING FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT

EASIER OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the

period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates

appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently

expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably con-

sistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited

in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks

to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about

[DEL: the current level] ____, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to

be growing over the [DEL: November-December] DECEMBER-JANUARY period



-15-

at annual rates within ranges of [DEL: 1 to 7] ____ TO ____ per

cent and [DEL: 5 to 9] ____ TO ____ per cent, respectively. If,

giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears

that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or

moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational

objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be

modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 6¼-to-6¾]

____ TO ____ per cent. IN THE CONDUCT OF DAY-TO-DAY

OPERATIONS, ACCOUNT SHALL BE TAKEN OF EMERGING FINANCIAL MARKET

CONDITIONS.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Total Reserves 6.3 6.0 5.7

On average, nonborrowed reserves expanded at about a 3 per cent

annual rate, total reserves at about a 5-1/2 per cent rate, and the mone-

tary base at an 8-1/2 per cent rate in the fourth quarter. The fourth

quarter growth rates for total reserves and the monetary base are at or some-

what below the growth rates for the 1977 QIII to 1978 QI period thought

to be consistent with the alternatives presented to Committee, as shown

in the table above. Thus, a modest acceleration in the growth of these

reserve aggregates will be needed over the months ahead. On the other hand,

recent growth in nonborrowed reserves has been below the longer-run growth

thought consistent with Alternative A, but above the growth rates shown for

Alternatives B and C. The estimates for nonborrowed reserves shown in

the table assume no change in the discount rate from its current level of

6 per cent. Increases in the discount rate would, of course, shift the

composition of total reserves more toward nonborrowed than borrowed reserves.

positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal

Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate

which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown

are fore 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data

are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average

of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and
loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement

week. Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction

for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities

for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current

FHA/VA ceiling.
