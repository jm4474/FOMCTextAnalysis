The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) The degree of pressure on reserve positions was left un-

changed over the intermeeting period. Federal funds generally traded in

the 3 percent area, despite the complications to Desk reserve management

posed by shortfalls in individual nonwithheld taxes, which showed

through to the Treasury balance, and by revisions to forecasts of re-

quired reserves. The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing

was raised $50 million in two steps to $100 million, reflecting an in-

crease in seasonal credit. After spiking at the March quarter-end,

borrowing returned to around its allowance, before moving noticeably

above it in the last complete maintenance period.

(2) Short-term interest rates were narrowly mixed on balance

over the intermeeting period, while most longer-term market rates

increased 10 to 20 basis points. Early in the period, long rates backed

up sharply as data on hourly earnings and commodity prices sparked

inflation fears. These yields subsequently declined as signs of more

favorable price behavior and a much slower pace of economic expansion

more than countered increasing doubts about the prospects for additional

fiscal restraint. Late in the intermeeting period, bond rates again

moved higher in response to unfavorable inflation readings. On the

other hand, the interest rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages has

fallen 15 basis points since the March meeting; its latest quote is only

1. Security prices were little affected by the Treasury's announce-
ment in early May of its plans to shorten average debt maturities.
Although some cutback in bond issuance had been anticipated, the
announced reduction was larger than most participants appear to have
expected; on the other hand, with the semi-annual auction of the
thirty-year bond starting in August and raised to about $11 billion,
the near-term supply of bonds will be heavier than had been expected.



a bit above its recent 20-year low. Quality spreads for most other

private rates were little changed, but they improved somewhat for specu-

lative-grade issues. Stock prices were mixed over the period. Bank

stocks dropped substantially, reflecting in part market perceptions that

net interest margins could narrow, especially in the absence of a pickup

in loan demands.

(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value declined by

almost 3 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period, reflecting a

variety of factors, including a less optimistic view regarding the pro-

spects for U.S. economic expansion. The dollar has dropped more than 4

percent on balance against the yen. A variety of statements by offi-

cials.in Japan and the United States fostered some market confusion for

a time and contributed to a strengthening of the yen. But a little of

the weaker tone of the dollar has dissipated since April 27, when the

Desk bought $200 million against yen for the accounts of the System and

the ESF in an effort to calm the market before the G-7 meeting on April

29, and key U.S. officials publicly clarified their position. The Bank

of Japan purchased nearly $7 billion for its own account in April and

early May. Japanese short-term rates were little changed. Other short-

term interest rates continued to move lower, with three-month German

rates falling nearly 50 basis points; French rates fell dramatically

(over 300 basis points) with the passing of devaluation fears after the

French election. Long-term interest rates rose in Japan, the United

Kingdom, and Canada, were little changed in Germany, and generally

declined elsewhere. The price of gold rose 10-1/2 percent; reported

reasons for the increase include inflation concerns in the United

States, rising demand from China and elsewhere in Asia, and supply

developments in Russia and South Africa.



(4) Over March and April, M2 fell at a 1/2 percent rate com-

pared with the 1-1/2 percent rate of growth that was projected in the

last bluebook, while M3 was unchanged, about as anticipated. Iden-

tifiable temporary factors accounted for most of the shortfall from the

M2 forecast. Rather than washing out over March and April as foreseen

in the last bluebook, these factors represented a depressant. In par-

ticular, individual nonwithheld tax payments in April came in well below

last year's level, rather than well above it, as had been expected.3

Hence, M2 was restrained by a slower buildup of liquid deposits in April

than implied by typical seasonal patterns. Abstracting from temporary

factors, the modest underlying growth of M2 over March and April was

only a bit below earlier expectations. Continued shifting to capital

market instruments doubtless held back underlying monetary expansion.

Inflows to bond and stock mutual funds were at a near-record pace in

March and reportedly were heavy in April.

(5) Broad money has surged in the two weeks ended May 10--M2

by $35 billion and M3 by $30 billion based on preliminary data--to

levels well above those embodied in the March bluebook.4 The burst

in liquid deposits in early May in part reflected unusually small draw-

downs to pay taxes. In addition, a resurgence in mortgage refinancing

activity, which had begun to boost the aggregates in April, evidently

2. Over March and April, M1 grew at a 5-3/4 percent rate, somewhat
below the March bluebook projection. With total reserves advancing at
a 3 percent rate and currency at a 9-1/4 percent pace, the monetary
base continued to expand at an 8-1/4 percent rate over the two months.

3. A boost to April M2 growth had been expected because households
were thought likely to build up balances to pay unusually high non-
withheld taxes. A spike in tax payments in January was thought to
presage another surge in April, resulting from shifts in bonus pay-
ments and other income into 1992. In fact, nonwithheld payments were
unusually low in April, as a tightening of penalties for insufficient
estimated tax payments apparently resulted in a greater shift of pay-
ments from April to January than earlier estimated.

4. M1 accounted for $25 billion of these increases, also moving
above its bluebook projection.



intensified in early May. But these factors can explain only some of

the surge. Underlying M2, which had been flat on balance from the

fourth quarter through April, thus seems to have strengthened in early

May to a level higher than anticipated in the last bluebook, despite

weaker-than-expected nominal GDP in the second quarter. Although it is

possible that the build-up is primarily noise, the burst also could

signify a waning of the forces that have contributed to the weakness in

underlying M2 relative to nominal spending in recent quarters. Even

with this early May surge, though, M2 has grown at only a 1/4 percent

annual rate from the fourth quarter of 1992 through the week of May 10,

while M3 still has fallen, leaving both aggregates below their target

cones but above their lower parallel bands. (See charts.)

(6) Bank credit growth picked up to a 5-1/4 percent rate over

March and April, reflecting acquisitions of securities. After declining

further in March, bank lending edged higher in April. Business loans,

however, continued to fall rapidly in April, about offsetting stepped-up

offerings of commercial paper by nonfinancial firms. Larger nonfinan-

cial firms continued to draw on proceeds of brisk equity and debt

issuance to pay down loans. Business loans at small banks posted a

third month of gains in April. The May Senior Loan Officer Survey

showed some further relaxation of price and non-price terms for business

loans, as well as a modest easing of standards, including the first

signs of easier standards for large firms.

(7) The overall net borrowing of nonfinancial businesses has

remained sluggish, owing to limited capital outlays relative to internal

funds and heavy net equity issuance. Enhanced incentives to use credit

cards for transactions may have contributed to a pickup in growth of

consumer installment credit through March and a sharp rise in consumer

loans at banks in April. State and local governments in April continued

to issue an exceptional volume of debt, mainly for refundings. Total

nonfederal debt growth, at a 3-3/4 percent rate in March, about matched

its growth from the fourth quarter to that month. Federal debt growth

has risen in recent months on a seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting

lower tax receipts this year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt is

estimated to have expanded at a 6-1/2 percent rate in March, bringing

growth from the fourth quarter through March to a 5 percent rate--a

little above the lower bound of its monitoring range for 1993.

Policy alternatives

(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-

sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would

continue to trade around 3 percent, in association with the allowance

for adjustment and seasonal borrowing initially being maintained at its

current level of $100 million.5 Under alternative A, the federal

funds rate would be reduced to 2-1/2 percent. This reduction could be

achieved either by lowering the initial borrowing allowance by $25

million or by reducing the discount rate 1/2 percentage point while

leaving the allowance unchanged at $100 million. Federal funds would

trade in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 percent under alternative C, in

association with an initial borrowing allowance of $125 million.

(9) In light of recent price reports, market participants now

generally seem to expect that the next change in the stance of monetary

policy is somewhat more likely to be toward tightening than toward ease,

but few appear to anticipate any move immediately after the May FOMC

meeting. Thus, market interest rates are unlikely to react to the

implementation of alternative B. The odds are that bond yields will

retrace at least some of their recent back-up if--as anticipated in the

greenbook forecast--the news on inflationary pressures proves more

favorable. The ongoing budget debates and the prospective announcement

of the Administration's health reform plan suggest that the volatility

associated with an uncertain fiscal outlook may persist. Shorter-term

rates could rise some with the approach of larger auction volumes of

bills and shorter-term notes. The value of the dollar on foreign

needed over the intermeeting period to account for expected growth in
the demand for seasonal credit during the late spring.



exchange markets probably would remain around current levels under

alternative B.

(10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds

rate under alternative A would surprise market participants and should

show through almost completely to other short-term interest rates. The

three-month bill rate would fall to around 2-1/2 percent, and the prime

rate probably would be reduced to 5-1/2 percent. With the economy

likely to exhibit a bit more strength than otherwise over the inter-

mediate run as a result of the easing, banks may feel a little more

confident about the ability of borrowers to repay loans. As a result,

banks might further ease other terms and standards on lending. Risk

premiums in short- and long-term market interest rates, already histori-

cally narrow, would probably remain around their current levels. Any

initial decline in longer-term yields could be limited by concerns that

the easier monetary policy stance indicated more emphasis on supporting

the economic expansion and less emphasis on containing inflation, par-

ticularly against the backdrop of the recent disappointing wage and

price behavior and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal

policy debate. Absent corresponding actions abroad to ease monetary

policy, downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar

would resume.

(11) Market participants also would be surprised by the policy

tightening under alternative C at this FOMC meeting. Bond yields may

well increase, but with the rise probably tempered by the sense that the

Federal Reserve was moving promptly to head off a resurgence of infla-

tion. Bill rates likely would jump by nearly the increase of 50 basis

points in the federal funds rate, and private money market rates could

rise a bit more, reflecting widening risk premiums. Banks would likely



boost the prime rate by 1/2 percentage point. Bank stock prices, which

have benefited from wide spreads between short-term deposit rates and

rates on longer-term assets, likely would extend their recent declines.

Overall stock price indexes probably would drop as well, and the result-

ing capital losses on bonds and stocks could restrain inflows to long-

term mutual funds, at least temporarily. The dollar would strengthen on

foreign exchange markets.

for the April-to-September period also are shown, assuming the money

market conditions of the three alternatives are maintained over the

summer. (More detailed data are presented in the table and charts on

the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2 would be just a

bit above its fourth-quarter level at midyear and would strengthen only

marginally further by September, thus staying noticeably below its 2 to

6 percent annual range. From its fourth-quarter base, M3 is projected

to show a contraction through June but little change by September under

all the alternatives, hence also remaining below its 1/2 to 4-1/2 per-

cent range.

(13) Under alternative B, M2 is projected to increase at about

a 5-3/4 percent average rate over May and June, a considerable pickup

from recent months.6  Some of the strength in May, and to a lesser

extent in June, reflects reversals of previous temporary depressants

involving tax effects, the late-winter lull in mortgage refinancing

activity, and seasonal-adjustment distortions.7 Apart from effects

of these temporary factors, underlying M2 probably will exhibit a speed-

up over the two months, owing to an abatement of the more fundamental

influences that had boosted its velocity to a 5-3/4 percent growth rate

over the previous two quarters. Quarterly average growth of M2 for the

second quarter is projected at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, with

temporary factors having little net impact. Thus, with nominal GDP

expected to rise at about a 4-1/4 percent rate, M2 velocity would

increase at only about a 2-1/2 percent pace. If the money market condi-

tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer, M2 growth

would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal GDP in the

third quarter.

(14) M3 under alternative B is seen as accelerating to about a

4 percent rate over May and June. This speedup would stem solely from

the pickup in M2, as managed liabilities in M3, including large time

deposits, should resume running off over the two months. Bank credit

expansion is expected to remain moderate, with loan growth quite weak,

6. M1 is projected to rise at an 18 percent annual rate from April
to June. The expansion in M1 deposits should show through in rapid
growth in required reserves, and total reserves would be expected to
expand at a 19-1/4 percent annual rate from April to June. With
currency growth anticipated at 11 percent over the two months, the
monetary base would rise at an 11-1/4 percent pace.

7. This year's seasonal adjustment factors for February and March
appear to be elevated artificially by the influence of System easing
actions around year-end 1990 and 1991 rather than evolving seasonal
patterns.



-12-

and the balance sheets of thrift institutions are anticipated to con-

tinue to contract. While inflows of core deposits are projected to meet

most of the added funding needs of banks and S&Ls, banks are likely to

obtain some funding from abroad and from other nondeposit sources, in

part to avoid higher deposit insurance premiums. Looking further ahead,

moderate average growth of M3 during the third quarter would be expected

to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative B over that

period.

(15) Households and businesses are expected to stay cautious

in using credit in coming months. In the household sector, mortgage

refinancing activity is likely to remain brisk. Overall mortgage debt,

however, is expected to expand at about its first-quarter pace, as cash-

out refinancing activity continues to be limited and home purchases rise

only gradually. Growth of consumer credit is projected to remain

moderate, despite heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other

incentives. Given still-favorable conditions in longer-term markets

under alternative B, issuance of corporate bonds and stocks should

remain relatively heavy. With the shortfall of internal funds relative

to capital expenditures remaining small, businesses are likely to con-

tinue to use the proceeds of securities issuance to pay down higher-cost

bonds and bank loans. Treasury borrowing should pick up in coming

months to finance a widening deficit, with more issuance in the shorter

end of the market, reflecting the recent shift in debt management

policy. Domestic nonfinancial debt would be expected to move further

above the lower edge of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range

through June.

(16) The lower interest rates of alternative A would be ex-

pected to provide some added lift to growth of the monetary aggregates.



-13-

Banks and thrifts, while continuing to price their deposits unaggres-

sively, likely would not immediately match the downward movement in

market rates. Yields on money market mutual funds, likewise, would lag

the decline in market rates. The lower opportunity costs of deposits

and money funds relative to short-term market rates should provide a

small boost to the aggregates, even though attractive yields would

continue to induce heavy inflows into bond and stock mutual funds. M2

growth over May and June would come in at about a 6 percent rate, with

much of the additional strength resulting from its M1 component. M3

would expand at a 4-1/4 percent rate. Despite the more rapid growth,

both of the broad monetary aggregates would remain well below their

annual ranges in June. M2 growth is projected to post a 2-3/4 percent

pace from June to September, bringing the rate of expansion for the

April to September period to 4 percent. Even with the lower interest

rates and consequent economic stimulus of this alternative later in the

year, M2 would be unlikely to reach the lower end of its annual range by

the fourth quarter.

(17) Under alternative C, the higher money market interest

rates and opportunity costs would restrain the monetary aggregates. The

restraint on the aggregates could be limited to the degree that capital

losses on bond and stock funds prompt investors to shift back into

deposits, but on balance the tighter monetary stance should act to slow

monetary growth. M2 would expand at only a 5-1/2 percent rate over May

and June, and M3 at a 3-3/4 percent pace. The moderate upward trajec-

tory of M2 expected under unchanged interest rates later in the year

would be trimmed, with growth from June to September likely at only a

1-1/2 percent rate; and M2 would finish the year well below its target

range. Maintenance of the money market conditions of alternative C

probably would induce M3 to contract on the year.

Directive language

(19) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options and updating.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/INCREASE

SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.

In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving

careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary

developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint

(WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint

would (MIGHT) be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent

with APPRECIABLE [DEL:a resumption of moderate] growth in the

broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.
