Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) Following the decline in January,M1 rose at a 13.4 per

cent annual rate in February and has expanded considerably further in early

March. M1 growth for the February-March target period thus appears to be

well in excess of the Committee's specified range of tolerance. For M2,

however, the expected growth rate for the February-March period remains

within its range of tolerance, as inflows into time deposits other than CD's,

after a large expansion in January, have been somewhat smaller than projected

recently. RPD's are expected to expand at a rate slightly above 6 per cent

over the two-month target period, close to the top of the range of tolerance.

(2) The large February increase in M1 , broadly based by region

and size of bank, occurred mainly during the three weeks ending February 20

and was associated with a very sharp, $4 billion, decline in U.S. Government

deposits. Changes in U.S. Government deposits often show little inverse

correlation with M1 after seasonal adjustment, but the unusually large size

of the change in Government deposits in the first three weeks of February

may have affected the level of private deposit holdings at least temporarily.

Subsequently, however, Government deposits have increased somewhat and M1

has continued to expand.

(3) As shown in the table below, growth in RPD in the current

February-March target period is now expected to be somewhat larger than that

at the time of the previous FOMC meeting (based on the midpoint of the

adopted range of tolerance). The upward revisions in the current estimate

are accounted for by the larger than expected growth in private demand deposits.

The other uses of RPD, in fact, are now estimated to have absorbed somewhat

fewer reserves than earlier estimated.

1/ Changes from January to March 1974. Column 1 is consistent with mid-

point of Committee's range of tolerance for RPD growth.
2/ Due to the weekly distribution of deposits and the lagged reserve require-

ments, the absolute change in RPD's absorbed by required reserves against
demand deposits is estimated to be negative over the two months from
January to March.

(4) The Federal funds rate fluctuated around 9 per cent from the

February meeting of the Committee until early March. By early March, the

strong expansion in M1 and RPD would, under normal circumstances, have

triggered a move to more restriction in reserve-supplying operations with

the funds rate moving toward the 9½ per cent top of its range. However, by

that time there already had been a broad-based increase of around 25-50 basis

points in short-term market interest rates and 10-30 basis points in long-

term rates. In addition, financial markets were in a sensitive state with

U.S. Government security dealers and bond underwriters still holding

sizable positions of longer term issues. With these considerations in

mind, on March 1 the Chairman recommended and the Committee concurred

that Federal funds rate be maintained at around the prevailing 9 per cent

level for the time being. On March 11, with the aggregates continuing

strong, the instruction to the Desk was amended by the Committee to restore

the range of tolerance for the funds rate approved at the February meeting.

but with the Manager expected to proceed very cautiously in moving the funds

rate above the 9 per cent level. Most recently, with the aggregates still

strengthening, the Manager has been operating in the expectation that the

funds rate would move up to around the 9½ per cent upper limit.

(5) From the mid-February Committee meeting to date, bill rates

have increased by about 80 basis points, with the 3-month bill rate most

recently at 7.85 per cent. For commercial paper and CD's, rates increased

by 50 to 70 basis points. In the weeks preceding the mid-February meeting,

short-term rates had declined by about a percentage point. The recent

increases--based in part on a change in expectations about monetary policy



-4-

and partly influenced by mid-March tax rate pressures--have retraced most

of that decline. Member bank borrowing at the Federal Reserve has changed

little, averaging $1,050 million over the last three weeks.

(6) Yields in all sectors of the bond market have also been

under upward pressure in recent weeks, as marketings of corporate, municipal,

and U. S. Government issues were large. In the Treasury coupon sector,

intermediate term rates increased by about 40 basis points as U. S. Government

security dealers reduced by $1.3 billion their very large positions acquired

in the mid-February refunding; dealer positions are now of moderate proportions.

The Desk purchased $190 million of coupon issues on March 13. Treasury

borrowing during the period was confined to a $1.5 billion sale of additional

short tax bills in early March. Interest rates on mortgages have declined

only slightly further. A continued large inflow of funds to savings and

loan associations was partly used to build liquidity and to reduce borrowings.

Stock market prices have shown a substantial rebound.

(7) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time

periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth rates computed

on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter

basis.

(9) Following the recent overshoot in M1 growth, both alternatives

B and C are designed to slow M1 growth and restore it to the 5¾ per cent

growth path adopted at previous meetings. Current estimates for M1 in

relation to the long-run growth path are shown in the chart on the following

page. Alternative B aims at a return of M1 to the path by September, whereas

alternative C moves it back more quickly by June (though it then falls

substantially below the path in the third quarter). Alternative A, which

is judged to be consistent with little change in money market conditions,

includes a growth rate for M1 over the next six months that remains above

the 5¾ per cent growth path.

-7-

(10) Effectuation of Committee policy in the weeks immediately

ahead will be taking place at a time when short-term credit markets will

have to absorb a large Treasury financing--one that will probably raise

about $4 billion of new cash. It is likely that part of the funds will

be raised through tax bills and the remainder through short-term coupon

issues. This is a somewhat larger cash offering than the market is

expecting, and will probably itself exert some upward pressure on interest

rates. If the Federal funds rate is rising at the same time, general

upward rate pressures are likely to be intensified,

(11) In returning to the M1 growth path by September, alternative

B includes a growth rate for M1 over the second quarter of around 5¾ per

cent and during the third quarter of 5 per cent, averaging close to 5¾ per

cent for the six month period. Achievement of such growth rates is expected

by the staff to entail some further increase in interest rates as bank

reserves are held back relative to demand. Demands for money and for

supporting bank reserves over the next several months are expected to be

sustained by the transactions needs associated with growth in nominal GNP

projected at 5.7 and 7.8 per cent for the second and third quarters,

respectively. These growth rates do not include any upward impact from

lifting the embargo, and thus could underestimate money demand to some

extent, particularly by the third quarter. In early spring, there is also

likely to be some increase in private cash balances due to higher than

average income tax refunds. In moving gradually back to the 5¾ per cent

long run path, the staff would expect that reserve provision in the weeks



-8-

ahead would lead to a rise in the Federal funds rate to around 10 per cent

between now and mid-April and would be associated with M1 growth over

the March-April period in a 6 ½-- 8 ½ per cent annual rate range.

(12) If such a rise in the funds rate did develop, it seems

probable that there would be pronounced effects in other areas of the

financial market. The 3-month bill rate would likely move up to around

8½ per cent or somewhat above, and long-term market rates would adjust

further upward. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to

commercial banks might slow to around a 10 per cent annual rate, about the

same as in the summer of 1973. Net inflows of deposits at thrift institutions

would be expected to recede to about a 6--7 per cent annual rate, close to

the amount involved in interest crediting. This would be a somewhat better

performance than in the summer of 1973, and appears possible because of the

large amount of interest-sensitive money already drained from these

institutions and because the institutions last summer had not fully

adjusted their advertising and rate policies to the new rate ceilings that

became effective at the beginning of July.

(13) Under alternative C, the expected rise of interest rates

would be much sharper--with the funds rate moving up into the 10¼--11 per

cent area--in order to bring the money supply back to the long run path by

mid-year. If interest rates rose so sharply, though, a strong effect on

money demand would be likely by the third quarter, with money growth in

that quarter projected to fell below a 4 per cent annual rate (unless

reserves were provided at a rate that would permit money market conditions to

ease sharply by around mid-year). A rise in the funds rate to as high as

11 per cent range would also threaten replication of the conditions of last

summer at thrift institutions. The mortgage commitment policies of



those institutions would again be under considerable restraint

and the viability of the current time and savings deposit ceiling

rate structure would probably come into question if high interest rate

levels- with the 3-month bill rate moving over 9 per cent--were sustained

for some time. There could well be significant feedback effects on GNP

of such developments by late summer, though more particularly by the fourth

quarter.

(14) Under alternative A--which encompasses a 6½ per cent growth

rate for M1 over the next six months--the staff would expect that the

Federal funds rate would not rise from current levels and might, over time,

drop back somewhat. If the funds rate remains around 9¼--9½ per cent,

there may be some further upward rate adjustments in markets, particularly

as the forthcoming Treasury financing is absorbed. A somewhat lower funds

rate would moderate and, perhaps to some degree reverse, recent upward

rate pressures. Short-term rates, particularly bill rates, are likely to

be influenced by the strength of business loan demands and by the way in

which the recycling of oil money affects U.S. markets. Assuming business

loan growth is moderate, banks, under this alternative, would probably

not be a source of pressure on markets in view of the continued availability

of demand deposits and strong growth in time and savings deposits other than

large CD's. Under the circumstances, banks would have little interest

in issuing additional CD's or in borrowing from the Euro-dollar market,

unless rates in that market were to drop sharply with the receipt of Arab

oil money in volume.



-10-

(15) In long-term credit markets, corporate and municipal bond

volume is likely to remain large over the next few months, based on the

current schedule of offerings. Foreign borrowing in the U.S. capital market

remains quite modest thus far, although it could pick up as borrowers become

more familiar with opportunities in the U.S. market. Some further upward

yield adjustments in bond markets might develop under current money market

conditions, while yield adjustments are likely to be considerable under

alternative B and very marked under alternative C. Further increases in

bond yields, as well as a rise of short-term interest rates, would also be

reflected in a tightening of mortgage market conditions.



-11-

Proposed directive language

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section. As will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth

rates in the aggregates "over the past 3 months." For the 3 months through

February, these are as follows: M1, 5.7 per cent; M2, 9.5 per cent; and the

bank credit proxy, 6.3 per cent.

(17) Alternatives B and C include a reference to the prospective

Treasury financing to be announced early in the week of the FOMC meeting. As

noted in paragraph ([13]), this financing will be in the short-term area, so

that there would ordinarily be little, if any, even-keel constraint. The

reference is added parenthetically to the alternatives which contemplate a

further tightening of money market conditions in view of the highly sensitive

state of financial markets.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-

national and domestic financial market developments, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with [DEL: moderate] MODERATELY GREATER growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-

national end domestic financial market developments (INCLUDING

THE PROSPECTIVE TREASURY FINANCING), the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-

national and domestic financial market developments (INCLUDING

THE PROSPECTIVE TREASURY FINANCING), the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]

SOMEWHAT LESS growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS.
