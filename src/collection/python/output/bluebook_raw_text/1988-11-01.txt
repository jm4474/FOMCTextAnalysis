text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the September FOMC meeting, reserve paths have con-

tinued to specify adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $600 million.

Over the two complete maintenance periods since the meeting, borrowing

averaged about $630 million, with borrowing in the first period well

above the targeted level, boosted by unexpectedly strong demands for

excess reserves. Federal funds have averaged around the upper end of

the 8 to 8-1/4 percent range expected to be associated with the borrow-

ing objective. Early in the intermeeting period, this firmness partly

reflected pressures related to the quarter-end. More recently demands

for discount window credit have been weaker than expected. In part this

may reflect some reluctance by larger banks to tap discount credit as a

consequence of unusually heavy borrowing on several successive settle-

ments Wednesdays. In addition discount window usage by smaller banks

has been quite light in October, perhaps in association with reduced

needs for this source of liquidity; credit growth at these banks is

estimated to have slackened, while household deposits have continued to

expand and Treasury note balances have remained at unusually high

levels. The weaker demand for discount credit seems to have persisted

through recent days, with borrowing averaging $440 million in the first

eight days of the current maintenance period and federal funds still

trading around 8-1/4 percent, about 1/8 percentage point above the

average in the weeks leading up to the September FOMC meeting. Seasonal

borrowing has averaged about $300 million in the current period, down

from peak levels of around $430 million a few weeks ago. Total reserves

contracted at about a 2 percent annual rate over September and October

as a drop in required reserves more than offset some increase in excess

reserves, but the monetary base expanded at about a 5-1/2 percent rate,

buoyed by continued moderate growth in currency.

(2) Other short-term interest rates generally climbed 10 to 25

basis points over the intermeeting period, perhaps reflecting the firmer

federal funds rate as well as increased supplies of Treasury bills and

CDs. Bond yields, though, declined somewhat in response to lower oil

prices and the incoming economic data, which were seen by market par-

ticipants as indicating moderate growth and reduced risk of greater

inflation and Federal Reserve tightening. However, rates on many cor-

porate bond issues subsequently rose substantially following announce-

ments of the Kraft and RJR Nabisco buyouts as investors reacted to

concerns about further leveraging. The shift in preference away from

bonds issued by companies now thought vulnerable to restructuring con-

tributed to lower rates on bonds of other issuers, including utilities,

financial corporations, sponsored agencies, and the Treasury. The

recent passage of legislation permitting renewed issuance of Treasury

bonds led to a small backup in yields on such securities, but on balance

Treasury bond rates are down about a quarter of a percentage point over

the period. The merger announcements, along with the drop in yields on

most bonds, tended to boost stock price indexes, which rose 2 percent or

so over the intermeeting period.



-4-

(3) The dollar's exchange value against G-10 currencies de-

clined by 4-1/2 percent since the last Committee meeting. The decline

in the dollar from its summer peak has been relatively orderly,

the dollar still remains 5 percent above its average of last December.

The recent decline was in response to indications of more moderate U.S.

economic growth and to information suggesting that U.S. external ad-

justment may not be proceeding as rapidly as had been thought. Short-

term interest rates abroad were little changed on balance, though in

recent days they have edged down in Germany and Japan. Long-term rates

declined by nearly 1/2 percentage point in Japan and around 1/4 percent-

age point in Germany, influenced by lower oil prices and by reduced

prospects for monetary tightening as the currencies of these countries

have appreciated.

(4) Growth of all the monetary aggregates slowed further in

September, and preliminary data suggest that expansion of M1 and M2 has

remained quite weak in October, as higher interest rates and opportunity

costs continue to curb demands for monetary assets. M3, however, ap-

pears to have rebounded this month in association with a resumption of

growth in bank credit. For the two months combined, M2 has expanded at

about a 1-1/2 percent rate, below the 3 percent August-to-December rate

specified by the FOMC at its September meeting, and M3 has increased at

about a 3 percent rate, compared with its 5 percent path. Since the



-5-

fourth quarter of 1987, M2 has risen at a 5-1/4 pace, placing that ag-

gregate below the middle of its target range, while M3 has expanded at a

6-1/4 percent rate, leaving it a bit above the midpoint of its range.

(5) Retail-type balances within M2 have grown at about a 3-1/2

percent rate over the last two months, about in line with expectations

at the last FOMC meeting. Issuance of consumer CDs has picked up sharp-

ly while liquid deposits have run off, consistent with the further

steepening of the deposit yield curve over the summer. The shortfall in

M2 has been concentrated in its volatile wholesale components--overnight

RPs and Eurodollars--and in demand deposits. With respect to demand

deposits, the decline in compensating balances may be a little stronger

than expected, while the weakness in the other components reflects re-

duced needs for funding owing to a sharp rise in Treasury balances and a

sluggish pace of bank credit growth on balance over the two months.

However, credit growth still has exceeded expansion of core deposits at

large banks; with Eurodollar rates tending to rise relative to domestic

rates as the dollar declined, commercial banks have been issuing large

time deposits in the United States at a rapid pace, helping to sustain

expansion of M3 above the pace of M2.

(6) The slowing in bank credit growth over September and

October combined does not seem to have shown through to overall domestic

nonfinancial debt, as part of the weakness in bank credit was accounted

for by loan sales and a drop in loans to financial borrowers. Debt

growth appears to have remained around its 8-1/2 percent average pace

for the year to date. Issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations



was again relatively light in September and October and sales by invest-

ment-grade industrial corporations have virtually ceased in the last few

days, following the large buyout announcements. Business borrowing from

shorter-term sources, while picking up this month, also has remained

sluggish. The slower pace of business borrowing in the third quarter

occurred despite an estimated widening in the financing gap, and is

mostly explained by a temporary drop-off in completed mergers and

buyouts. However, available data suggest borrowing by the household

sector has been well-maintained in recent months, partly in association

with fairly robust home sales. And, borrowing by both federal and state

and local governments picked up somewhat--the latter in anticipation of

possible expiration of the tax-exempt status of certain revenue bonds.



Policy Alternatives

(7) The standard three policy alternatives are presented

below. Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be built

with seasonal plus adjustment borrowing of $600 million, while under

alternatives A and C reserve paths would incorporate borrowing levels of

$400 million and $800 million, respectively.

(8) The table below presents monetary growth rates over the

September-to-December period associated with the policy alternatives.1

M2 growth, though picking up a bit, would remain sluggish under all of

the alternatives, with its M1 component continuing especially weak.

Further adjustment of portfolios to the previous rise in interest rates

and opportunity costs is expected to continue to restrain retail ac-

counts in M2 over the remainder of this year, while efforts by busi-

nesses to pare demand deposits in association with lowered compensating

balance requirements should depress M1 and to a lesser extent M2 in-

creasingly as year-end approaches. Despite the expected slight acceler-

ation in M2, its earlier weakness should keep growth of this aggregate

from its August base a bit below the 3 percent specification in the

directive issued at the September FOMC meeting. For the year, M2 growth

is expected to come in at around 5-1/4 percent under all the alterna-

tives.

1. The current directive specifies monetary growth expectations from an
August base. However, with monetary data for the entire month of Sep-
tember now available, the standard practice of using the last month of
the previous quarter has been followed in specifying the alternatives.
Growth rates for the aggregates from their August base implied by each
alternative are given in the detailed tables on page 8.

(9) Projections of M2 and M3 incorporate some allowance for

the effects of a surge in merger and buyout activity that now seems

likely in the fourth quarter. Banks are expected to provide a substan-

tial portion of the initial financing, boosting their funding needs.

The overnight Eurodollar component of M2 may be lifted as banks become

more aggressive bidders in Eurodollar markets. In addition, M2 may be

affected temporarily if equity sellers hold liquid balances while decid-

ing on how to realign their portfolios. However, the greater effect is

likely to be on M3, given its broader range of managed liabilities.

This aggregate would have been expected to strengthen even in the ab-

sence of the new buyouts, as bank credit rebounded further and Treasury

deposit balances were drawn down, but the pickup is now seen as somewhat

greater. The effect is likely to be quite uneven, depending on the

timing of the transactions, but on balance M3 over November and December

now is projected to accelerate sufficiently under all three alternatives

to imply growth from August at nearly the 5 percent path specified at

the last FOMC meeting. This growth will keep M3 expansion for the year

at around 6-1/4 percent, a little above its midpoint.

(10) Maintenance of current reserve conditions under alterna-

tive B is in line with market expectations about the near-term course of

policy, and as a consequence any changes in interest rates and dollar

exchange rates are likely to be relatively small. The federal funds

rate under the borrowing specifications of this alternative would be

expected to remain mostly in an 8 to 8-1/4 percent range. While con-

tinuation of the recent firmness cannot be ruled out, the funds rate may

move a little lower in this range as the effects of the temporary fac-

tors that appear to have reduced demands for borrowed reserves wear off.

In this case, other short-term rates would edge down as well. However,

very short-term rates could firm a bit in December as banks and other

borrowers position themselves in anticipation of year-end pressures;

some year-end pressures have already began to show through in short-term

rates, though far less than last year. While rates already have ad-

justed to an extent to anticipated buyouts, further temporary effects

may accompany the financial flows associated with the actual transac-

tions. CD and commercial paper issuance should balloon, possibly

putting some upward pressure on private short-term rates, and substan-

tial new supplies of low-grade corporate bonds also may be forthcoming.

In the Treasury market, some increases in bond rates could occur if the

Treasury were to announce a larger-than-usual offering on the mid-

quarter refunding to take advantage of the shortage of bonds created by

the absence of a long bond at the previous refunding as well as by

skimpy offerings of investment-grade corporate bonds.



-11-

(11) Under alternative B, M2 growth would strengthen modest-

ly--to a 3 percent rate--from the 1-1/4 percent pace of September and

October, largely reflecting some turnaround in overnight RPs and

Eurodollars. In addition, growth in retail accounts in M2 would firm a

little; the damping influence of earlier increases in market interest

rates should diminish, in part as opportunity costs edge down with

rising deposit offering rates. M1 would be expected to be about un-

changed over November and December as demand deposits and OCDs continue

to run off through year-end. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would be

about flat in the fourth quarter and growth in its velocity would

strengthen to a 6-1/2 percent rate given the staff GNP forecast. M2

would grow at only a 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter on this basis,

implying a 4-1/2 percent rate of increase in its velocity. Such an

increase in velocity is a little larger than implied by the staff models

of M2 demand, which show the rise in interest rates from earlier this

year damping M2 growth in the fourth quarter by about 3-1/2 percent, but

within their usual margin of error. Under this alternative, M2 would

enter the year at around the lower end of its provisional range for

1989, and absent a significant subsequent change in policy, would

strengthen only gradually next year, remaining well down in its range

for some time.

(12) M3 growth is expected to pick up to a 6-1/2 percent rate

over November and December under alternative B, implying quarterly

average growth of 4-1/2 percent in the current quarter and a further

rise in its velocity--at a 2 percent rate. Under this alternative, M3



-12-

would begin the year in the upper half of its tentative range. However,

M3 growth might weaken a bit in the early part of 1989 as bank loans to

finance buyouts were repaid or sold to other investors. And, in

general, trend growth in bank and thrift credit should remain damped in

response to capital requirements and regulatory pressures.

(13) Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to

strengthen to a 9 percent pace over November and December, leaving

growth for 1988 at 8-3/4 percent and placing the debt aggregate on a

path around year-end near the middle of its tentative monitoring range

for next year. In addition to the financing of equity retirements,

business demands for funds will be augmented by a larger shortfall of

internal funds in relation to investment spending. Household borrowing

is expected to be well maintained through year-end, with mortgage de-

mands tilting more in the direction of fixed-rate contracts in response

to their narrower spread over ARM borrowing costs. Borrowing by the

federal government should drop substantially on a seasonally adjusted

basis, but this would not represent any abatement of underlying pres-

sures by this sector on financial markets as a somewhat larger deficit

is financed by a drawdown of cash balances. Issuance of tax-exempt debt

is expected to moderate somewhat, especially now that authority to issue

tax-exempt revenue bonds has been extended another year.

(14) Under alternative A, money market interest rates would

decline about 1/2 percentage point, with the 3-month Treasury bill drop-

ping to a little below 7 percent. The dollar would come under sharp



-13-

downward pressure, especially in view of the remote prospects for a com-

parable easing of policy abroad. Long-term interest rates would decline

further but the extent of the drop might be limited by the weaker tone

of the dollar and would depend in any event on market interpretations as

to whether incoming data suggested a sustained easing of pressures on

domestic resources and prices. In the absence of particularly weak

economic data, the yield curve could steepen a bit.

(15) The decline in money market rates and opportunity costs

would strengthen M2 growth over November and December to a 4-1/4 percent

average rate. Its M1 component also would pick up over the final two

months of the year, though demand deposits would still run off as com-

pensating balances were adjusted to previous increases in rates. Early

next year, M2 would be close to the midpoint of its provisional range

and on a trajectory that would lift it into the upper half of that

range. M3 growth would pick up to a 7 percent rate over November and

December, placing this aggregate on a path above the midpoint of its

provisional range early next year.

(16) With little anticipation of a near-term tightening of

policy remaining in the market, short-term interest rates would climb

about 1/2 percentage point under alternative C. The dollar probably

would reverse some of its recent decline, and long-term interest rates

also would rise. The extent of this rise could be relatively small if

the tightening of policy were interpreted as damping activity and reduc-

ing inflationary risks in an economy that was already seen to be

experiencing more moderate growth.



-14-

(17) Under alternative C, M2 would expand at only a 2 percent

rate over the remainder of the year. This aggregate would be well below

the lower end of its provisional range at the beginning of 1989 and

given the lagged effect of the change in interest rates, growth would

remain quite damped for a while. Wider opportunity costs would reduce

inflows to retail accounts, and M1 balances would contract. M3 still

would continue to strengthen under this alternative--the pickup, though,

being limited by rate-induced outflows from money funds--and enter 1989

well within its tentative range.

Directive Language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

usual options, is shown below. Note that, consistent with the specifica-

tions presented above and past practice for meetings at this time of the

year, the suggested base for the monetary aggregates has been moved from

August to September.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain

(Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications

of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expan-

sion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and develop-

ments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets,

somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT),

or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might,

be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth

of M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: August] SEPTEMBER through

December at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 3-and-5] percent,

respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consul-

tation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that reserve conditions during the period before the next

meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6-to-10] percent.
