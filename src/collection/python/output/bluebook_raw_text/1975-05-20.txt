Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 expanded at an annual rate of about 5.9 per cent in April,

1/
and current data suggest about a 9 per cent growth rate for May. Thus,

for the two-month target period M1 appears to be growing at around a 7½ per

cent annual rate, a shade below the mid-point of the Committee's range of

tolerance. The higher rate of growth in M1 for May in part reflects the

substantial volume of tax rebates being disbursed by the Treasury. Growth

in time deposits other than large money market CD's has been somewhat slower

than expected, and M2 appears to be expanding at an annual rate of around

9 per cent over the April-May period, the lower end of its range of

tolerance.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark revision
of monetary aggregates that will be published this coming Thursday. Revisions
in the series (based in large part on the results of the December call report
and new data for foreign agencies and branches) lowered M1 by about $700
million in March of 1975 and as a result first quarter M1 growth at an annual
rate was lowered from 3.5 to 2.4 per cent. Growth in M2 and M3, however,

was little changed by the revision. All tables on subsequent pages of this

report (with the exception of Tables 1 and 2 following the charts) are based
on the new series. The new and old series are compared in Appendix Table VI.

(2) The bank credit proxy appears to be expanding at an annual

rate of about 4 per cent over the April-May period. With business demand

for short-term credit remaining weak and the spread between commercial paper

rates and the bank prime rate continuing relatively wide, bank loans to

businesses contracted further in April and early May. The weakness in loan

demand along with the strength in time and savings deposit flows led

banks to continue adding to their holdings of Government securities, while

allowing further runoffs in CD's. Over the first 4 months of 1975 Government

security portfolios have expanded by about $16 billion, while CD's have

dropped by about $6 billion. Banks have apparently also found it attractive

to advance funds to their branches abroad; preliminary reports from branches

indicate that liabilities to their head offices in the U.S. increased by

about $2 billion in the first quarter.

(3) Following the April 15 FOMC meeting, the Account Manager

initially sought reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate



-3-

of 5½ per cent or a shade lower. In following weeks, with incoming data

on the monetary aggregates suggesting that M1 growth over the April-May

target period would be in the lower half of the Committee's range of

tolerance, the Account Manager sought easier money market conditions.

In doing so, however, the Manager tried to avoid aggressive operations that

might distort market expectations about monetary policy during the course

of the Treasury's large May refinancing. In the statement week just ended,

when the Desk sought a Federal funds rate declining into the 5-5¼ per cent

area, an average rate of 5.20 per cent was realized.

(4) Short-term interest rates, after showing little change in

late April, have since declined 25-50 basis points. Most recently, 3-month

bills have traded around 5 per cent--the lowest level since December 1972--

and 3-month CD's and commercial paper around 5-3/4 per cent. These markdowns

of short rates have reflected the decline in the funds rate, against a

background of continuing weakness in short-term credit demands, the return

to more moderate money growth in April, and somewhat disappointing economic

data. Market reaction to the decline in the discount rate to 6 per cent

was mild.

(5) Bond yields rose in the last half of April, but have since

declined 10-25 basis points. The recent rally began following the May 1

Treasury announcement that its borrowing needs over the May-June period

would be $5 billion less than previously stated, and it has since been

sustained by the decline of short-term rates. Against this background,

the Treasury's sale of $7 billion of coupon issues thus far in May has

gone smoothly. The well publicized problems with respect to New York City

have led to a virtual halt in trading in New York City issues, but have



-4-

thus far had only minor spill-over effects on the municipal market as

a whole.

(6) Deposits at nonbank thrift institutions continued to expand

at a rapid pace in April, reflecting lower market interest rates and the

placement of tax refunds. Growth in deposits at S&L's and MSB's combined

is estimated at an annual rate of 15 per cent in April, the same as the first-

quarter experience. While mortgage lenders have remained cautious, commit-

ments appear to have risen somewhat further in March and April. Mortgage

market interest rates have risen somewhat over the past few weeks.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over various time

periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates computed

on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter

basis.

Prospective developments

(8) Summarized below for Committee consideration are alternative

short-run operating ranges of tolerance for key monetary aggregates and the

Federal funds rate. More detailed figures on monetary aggregates, including

growth rates for six month periods comprising the second and third quarters,

are shown in the table on p. 6a. Appendix table V shows associated figures

for total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, and RPD's.

RPD 3 -5 2¼-4¼ 1¼ -3¼

Federal funds rate
(intermeeting range) 4-5 4¾-5¾ 5½ -6½

(9) The ranges of tolerance summarized above are generally

consistent with the longer-run 12-month growth ranges adopted by the Committee

at its last meeting. These growth ranges for the March '75-March '76 period

included: M1, 5-7½ per cent; M2 , 8½ -10½ per cent; M3 , 10-12 per cent; and

the bank credit proxy, 6½ -9½ per cent. In all three of the alternatives for

short-run operating targets, the two-month monetary growth rates are above

longer-run ranges, mainly reflecting the temporary impact of large tax

rebates paid out by the Treasury in May and June. In some cases, 6-month

growth rates are also above longer-run objectives.

(10) Each of the alternative short-run operating targets would,

of course, imply different patterns of interest rate change and monetary

aggregate growth as the year progresses. Alternative A, which contemplates

a near-term easing of money market conditions, and an 8 per cent rate of growth

in M1 over the second and third quarters, would imply a considerable

turn-around of interest rates later this year if growth in the aggregates

over the 12-month period is to be kept at around the mid-points of the

indicated longer-term ranges, assuming the GNP projection is correct.

Alternative B implies a somewhat smaller rise in interest rates later.

Alternative C involves rising interest rates over the near-term, lower growth

in the monetary aggregates in the second and third quarters, and hence less

upward interest rate pressure later.

(11) The Federal funds rate range for alternative B is centered

near the 5-5 per cent area in which funds have been most frequently

trading in recent days. Given this funds rate, M1 in the May-June period

is expected to increase at a 7½-9½ per cent annual rate. The rate of

growth in M1 is expected to moderate in the third quarter, even though

nominal GNP is projected to expand markedly, as the public reduces balances

temporarily swollen by tax refunds. For the second and third quarters

combined, M1 under this alternative is indicated to expand at about a 7 per

cent annual rate. M2 over the same period would be expected to expand at

about a 10 per cent annual rate, as inflows of consumer-type time and

savings deposits to banks remain sizable.

(12) If the Federal funds rate shows little change over the next

few weeks, we would expect other market interest rates to fluctuate within

a narrow range. After the Treasury auctions $1 billion of 2-year notes



-8-

next week, it will have essentially completed its new cash financing for

this half year (apart from continuing cash additions to bill auctions

through mid-June). The corporate and state and local bond calendars

remain sizable, but recent issues have been accorded good receptions, and

the steepness of the yield curve may continue to encourage some investors to

acquire longer-term issues. Business credit demands on banks and in the

commercial paper market are expected to remain weak, at least into early

summer, as corporations continue to restructure balance sheets and liquidate

inventories.

(12) Credit markets remain highly sensitive, however. U.S.

Government security dealer positions have risen substantially in the wake

of recent financing activity, with positions totaling about $8¼ billion

on May 15 (or $2-3/4 billion more than a month ago). Under the circumstances,

and given the very recent decline in the funds rate, any significant

increase in the rate would probably lead to fairly sharp upward adjustments

of interest rates as market expectations abruptly change.

(13) Alternative C contemplates a rise of the Federal funds

rate into a 5½-6½ per cent range. Under this option, the rise in short-

term interest rates may be substantial over the next few weeks--with the

3-month bill rate rising into the 6-7 per cent area--and long-term rates

would probably also rise significantly. It is expected that such a

tightening of money market conditions would lead to M growth over the
1

second and third quarters at around a 6 per cent annual rate. As market

interest rates rise, net inflows of time and savings deposits to banks

and thrift institutions would also diminish, as compared with alternative B.

Mortgage market conditions would certainly tighten further.



-9-

(14) Alternative A involves a further easing of money market

conditions, which would likely be accompanied by further downward adjust-

ments in market interest rates more generally. Declines in bond rates

might be rather limited, however, as corporate borrowers would be expected

to accelerate offerings in order to take advantage of a more favorable

market environment. Over the second and third quarters, M1 growth would

be projected at around 8 per cent at an annual rate, while growth in M2

might be at an 11 per cent rate. A substantially lower rate of

monetary growth would be required in the fourth and first quarters unless

the Committee were to raise its longer-run targets, and, as noted

earlier, this would probably require a marked upward readjustment in

interest rates later this year.

(15) Securities markets generally, and the municipal market

in particular, have shown little reaction thus far to the prospect of a

default by New York City on its outstanding notes. It is possible,

however, that an actual default could have wider market repercussions

if investors back away from other issues judged to involve a fair degree

of capital risk. In addition, there may be diminished investor con-

fidence in institutions with large holdings of New York City obligations.

Should markets become very unsettled, the Manager might need to engage

in stabilizing operations, taking account of the customary directive

language regarding "developments in domestic and international

financial markets", in which case the aggregate specifications might

temporarily have to be disregarded.



-10-

Proposed directive

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to

delete the reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-May

financing has been completed. As will be noted, alternatives A and B

refer to growth in monetary aggregates "on average in recent months."

Over the first 4 months of this year, growth rates (using revised data)

were 2.9, 8.3, and 10.8 per cent for M1, M2, and M3 , respectively.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the forth

coming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic and

international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: somewhat]

more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

than has occurred on average in recent months.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the forth

coming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic and

international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with somewhat

more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

than has occurred on average in recent months.



-11-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the forth

coming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and inter-

national financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: somewhat more

rapid] MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

[DEL: than has occurred on average in recent months].
