MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1)  Investors had largely anticipated the FOMC’s decision at the November 

meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4 percent, to maintain 

its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable growth were balanced, 

and to retain the “policy accommodation” and “measured pace” references.  As a 

result, financial asset prices changed relatively little immediately after the 

announcement.1  However, expectations for the path of monetary policy dropped in 

response to the release of the minutes on November 22, which cited the potential 

risks of excessive policy tightening and suggested the possibility of changes to the 

statement in the near future.  Inflation data were benign over the intermeeting period, 

while the news on spending and output was generally a little stronger, on balance, 

than investors had expected.  On net over the intermeeting period, market 

participants marked up slightly their path for the funds rate through the middle of 

next year, but policy expectations beyond that horizon fell somewhat (Chart 1).2  

Futures quotes indicate that investors currently expect a 25-basis-point hike in the 

target at the upcoming meeting, attach a high probability to a similar increase in 

January, and place some odds on a quarter-point move at the March meeting.  Half of 

the respondents to the Desk’s latest dealer survey expect the Committee to change the 

“measured pace” language in the upcoming statement, and most anticipate some 

                                           
1 Over the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds rate was close to the target.  The Desk 
purchased $3 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market and $489 million of Treasury bills 
from foreign customers.  The Desk redeemed $189 million of Treasury coupon securities.  The 
volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased $9 billion, to $20 billion, which included a 28-day 
forward RP of $5 billion arranged on December 7 for settlement on December 8. 
2 The discussion in this Bluebook reflects financial market developments through the close of 
business on December 8.

modification to the characterization of policy as “accommodative.”  Option-implied 

uncertainty about the expected path for policy over the next six months edged a bit 

higher over the period. 

(2) Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities fell about 5 basis points over 

the intermeeting period, while those on ten-year nominal Treasury issues declined 

around 10 basis points, on net.3  Thus, the yield curve flattened slightly, leaving its 

slope considerably lower than in recent years (see box entitled “Possible 

Interpretations of the Term Structure of Interest Rates”).  Amid reassuring data on 

core inflation and mixed readings on energy prices, TIPS-based inflation 

compensation for the next five years fell about 10 basis points after adjusting for carry 

effects, while the five-year forward measure moved down a bit further.4  According to 

the Michigan survey, the short- and long-term inflation expectations of households 

retraced a considerable portion of the increases observed after the hurricanes struck 

the Gulf Coast. 

(3) Broad stock indexes advanced about 4 to 6 percent over the intermeeting 

period, propelled by news suggesting continued robust economic growth with 

moderate inflation (Chart 2).  Implied volatility on major equity indexes declined 

substantially, on net, to very low levels.  Apart from mounting troubles in the auto 

industry, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms generally remained solid, given their 

strong balance sheets and profits.  The delinquency rate on C&I loans stayed at a 
                                           
3 The December ten-year Treasury futures contract is the first to trade under the new Chicago Board 
of Trade rule that limits the open interest of any single investor to $5 billion during the last ten days 
of trading, an interval that in this cycle began on December 7.  Unlike during the September cycle, 
trading conditions in the security that is the cheapest to deliver into that contract, the August 2012 
note, have reportedly remained liquid.   
4 Five-year inflation compensation without adjusting for carry effects fell about 30 basis points over 
the intermeeting period.  However, the staff estimates that most of this decline can be attributed to 
the effect of the inflation indexation lag in TIPS—that is, the carry effect—as energy prices caused 
the total non-seasonally-adjusted CPI to spike higher in September, and investors expect the CPI to 
fall back in November, judging from surveys and futures quotes.  Estimates of the magnitude of the 
impact are somewhat imprecise, but making an approximation for carry effects seems preferable to 
no adjustment.

Possible Interpretations of the Term Structure of Interest Rates 
 
The shape of the money market and Treasury yield curves contains information about 
investors’ expectations of the trajectory of policy, economic growth, and inflation in 
coming quarters.  The Eurodollar futures curve currently slopes downward after the 
middle of next year, which suggests that investors attach significant odds to a change 
in the direction of monetary policy around that time.  Under our standard assumption 
for the term premium, futures rates imply about a 25-basis-point decline in the target 
funds rate between mid-2006 and the end of 2007.  Generally in line with futures 
quotes, the average expected target funds rate from the Desk’s recent survey declines 
almost 10 basis points from the middle of next year to the end of 2006.  Investors’ 
anticipation of a modest policy easing sometime after the middle of next year is 
consistent with expectations of a moderate slowing in economic growth or a decline 
in inflation.     
 
Researchers have noted that the Treasury yield curve tends to invert shortly before 
business cycle peaks, and a few commentators have argued that the current shape of 
the term structure is a harbinger of a slowdown or even a recession.  However, the 
yield curve has flattened only a touch over the intermeeting period, and its slope 
remains positive and close to its historical average at most horizons.  Based on simple 
regressions that control for the comparatively low level of the estimated term 
premium, the current slope of the term structure – as measured by the difference 
between three-month and ten-year Treasury yields – implies real GDP growth rates 
that are quite comparable to Board staff and private forecasts.  In addition, the slope 
of the term structure now implies only small odds on a contraction in output anytime 
within the next two years.  For details on the staff’s analysis of the implications of the 
shape of the yield curve and GDP growth expectations, see “Some Perspectives on 
Longer-Term Yields,” memo to the Federal Open Market Committee, June 23, 2005, 
pages 49-67.

historically low level in the third quarter, and bond defaults increased a bit further in 

October, mainly reflecting bankruptcy filings by Delphi and Refco.  Yields on 

investment-grade corporate debt moved about in line with those on comparable 

Treasury securities, leaving risk spreads about unchanged, and speculative-grade debt 

spreads were up only a little, despite intensified credit concerns in the auto sector.  

Year-end pressures in money markets have been minimal (see box entitled “Year-end 

Pressures”).  

(4) The major-currency index of the dollar’s foreign exchange value rose about 

¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).5  The dollar gained more than      

3 percent versus the yen, as Japanese authorities publicly pressured the Bank of Japan 

to delay transition from its quantitative easing policy.  The dollar also appreciated 

about 1½ percent against the euro.  Social unrest in France may have weighed on the 

euro early in the period, and market commentary suggested that an additional negative 

factor for the euro was continued repatriation of funds from Europe by U.S. firms 

prompted by the tax break provided under the Homeland Investment Act.  The 

European Central Bank raised its minimum refinancing rate 25 basis points on 

December 1—its first policy move in almost two and one-half years—but investors 

reportedly interpreted subsequent comments by ECB President Trichet as signaling 

less tightening ahead than they had anticipated.  The dollar depreciated 1¾ percent 

vis-à-vis the Canadian dollar, as Canadian domestic demand continued to be robust.  

The Bank of Canada raised its overnight policy rate 25 basis points on December 6 

and indicated that additional tightening likely will be needed.  Yields on long-term 

government securities in major foreign industrial countries edged down on balance 

over the period.  Stock markets registered substantial gains, led by Japan’s Nikkei

Year-end Pressures 
 
As in 2003 and 2004, year-end pressures in money markets have been muted so far in 
2005.  As shown in the left-hand panel of the chart below, the spread of yields on 
thirty-day A2/P2 commercial paper over those on A1/P1 paper remained low as the 
maturity date crossed year-end.  Although the volume of outstanding commercial 
paper has increased in 2005, the continued strength in business credit quality has 
likely damped the premium investors require to hold lower-rated paper over the turn 
of the year.  In repo markets, there are some signs of special demand for Treasury as 
opposed to other collateral in contracts that extend over year-end, but the spread of 
one-month term federal funds over comparable Treasury RP rates, as noted in the 
right panel, has stayed low and does not point to any significant concerns about year-
end pressures in the funds market.  Indeed, federal funds futures quotes imply that 
investors do not expect the effective federal funds rate to deviate much from the 
expected target over year-end.  The persistent low volatility of the effective funds rate 
in recent years along with expectations that the Desk will provide ample liquidity at 
year-end has probably reduced pressures in uncollateralized overnight funding 
markets.

index, which moved up nearly 10 percent on signs of improving growth and prospects 

for earnings.  Stock prices in the euro area and Canada rose 6 to 7 percent. 

(5) The dollar fell about 1 percent over the intermeeting period against an index 

of currencies of our other important trading partners.  The dollar depreciated          

2½ percent against the Mexican peso amid growing optimism about economic 

performance there.  The dollar also fell 1¾ percent versus the Brazilian real.  Stock 

prices moved up strongly in both countries, and Mexican and Brazilian sovereign yield 

spreads narrowed.  Equity prices also rose substantially in a number of Asian 

emerging market economies, including Taiwan and Korea, although exchange rates 

versus the dollar generally moved in narrow ranges.   

(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt grew at a 9 percent annual rate in the 

third quarter, similar to its pace over the first half of the year, but is expected to 

decelerate somewhat in the current quarter (Chart 4).  Household mortgage debt 

expanded at an annual rate of 14 percent in the third quarter, but it is likely to slow 

somewhat in the current quarter against the backdrop of increases in mortgage rates.  

Bankruptcy filings have remained at very low levels after surging just before the new 

bankruptcy reform legislation became effective on October 17.  Although commercial 

paper outstanding appears to have been about flat on balance in the fourth quarter, 

overall business-sector debt has continued to expand at a fairly brisk pace, reflecting 

strong growth in C&I lending and moderate net bond financing.  Federal debt is 

projected to advance at about a 7¾ percent annual rate in the current quarter, up 

from the 5 percent pace posted in the third quarter, while state and local government 

borrowing is expected to moderate as the pace of advance refundings declines. 

(7) M2 growth slowed in November, reflecting recent increases in the 

opportunity cost of money holdings.  The deceleration was especially apparent in 

liquid deposits and retail money market funds.  Waning mortgage prepayment effects 

stemming from the rise in mortgage interest rates appeared to more than offset a

hurricane-related boost to M2.  An increased relative attractiveness of equity 

investments may also have damped M2 growth.  The rise in share prices in November 

was accompanied by a strong rebound in net inflows into domestic equity funds.  M2 

is expected to expand at about the same pace as nominal GDP in the current quarter.  

Appendix B analyzes the growth of money and nonfinancial debt this year. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 42



Economic Outlook 

(8) Data on spending and production generally came in on the high side of 

expectations over the intermeeting period, leading the staff to trim its assessment of 

the impact of the recent hurricanes on the economy and to mark up somewhat its 

assessment of the near-term momentum to spending.  In addition, recent data on 

productivity prompted the staff to revise up a bit its forecast for structural 

productivity growth.  With the economic expansion seen as a little stronger than had 

previously been forecast, the staff now assumes that the federal funds rate rises into 

early next year before leveling out at 4½ percent, 25 basis points higher than in the 

last Greenbook.  Stock prices are projected to rise at a rate sufficient to provide risk-

adjusted returns comparable to those on fixed-income instruments, and the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar is expected to decline gradually.  With policy assumed to 

be on hold after early next year, longer-term interest rates are about flat over the 

forecast period.  Oil prices are projected to remain near current levels over the next 

two years.  Against this backdrop, the staff sees output growing near potential over 

2006 and 2007, with very little remaining slack in the economy.  The indirect effects 

of this year’s large run-up in energy prices are expected to push core PCE inflation to 

about 2 percent next year, but, as those effects wane and productivity growth remains 

strong, core inflation is projected to slow to 1¾ percent in 2007.  With energy prices 

flattening out, headline inflation roughly matches core inflation over the forecast 

period.     

Policy Alternatives 

(9) This Bluebook breaks with the staff’s usual practice by presenting two 

policy alternatives—B and C—that differ only in their statement language; both entail 

an increase in the target federal funds rate of 25 basis points (Table 1).  Given the absence 

of major surprises in the economic and financial environment during the intermeeting

Rationale 

3. The cumulative rise in energy and other costs 
has the potential to add to inflation pressures; 
however, core inflation has been relatively low 
in recent months and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain contained.    

The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the 
potential to add to inflation pressures; however, c Core 
inflation has been stayed relatively low in recent 
months and longer-term inflation expectations remain 
contained.   Nevertheless, possible increases in 
resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices 
have the potential to add to inflation pressures. 

Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months 
and longer-term inflation expectations remain 
contained.  Nevertheless, relatively high levels of 
resource utilization as well as elevated  T the 
cumulative rise in energy prices have and other costs 
has the potential to add to inflation pressures. ; 
however, core inflation has been relatively low in 
recent months and longer-term inflation expectations 
remain contained. 

4. The Committee perceives that, with 
appropriate monetary policy action, the upside 
and downside risks to the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price stability should 
be kept roughly equal. 

The Committee judges that some further measured 
policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to 
both price stability and sustainable economic growth 
roughly in balance. 

 
[Unchanged] 

 

Assessment 
of Risks 

5. With underlying inflation expected to be 
contained, the Committee believes that policy 
accommodation can be removed at a pace that 
is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the 
Committee will respond to changes in

period, the choice of another 25 basis point firming at this meeting would be 

consistent with the Committee’s indication in November that policy tightening can 

likely proceed at a measured pace.  A policy firming of that dimension would also be 

consistent with the staff forecast, in which modest further tightening is projected to 

be sufficient to contain inflation and foster sustainable growth.  This Bluebook’s 

particular focus on the announcement is motivated by the Committee’s interest in 

modifying its statement language before long, as evidenced by the considerable 

discussion at the last meeting and the ensuing intermeeting survey of meeting 

participants’ preferences for the announcement.  Under Alternative B, the form of the 

assessment of risks would be modified notably, with the Committee indicating 

explicitly a judgment that some further tightening would be necessary to keep the 

risks to both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  By 

contrast, Alternative C retains much of the form as well as important elements of the 

content of the November FOMC statement, including the characterization of policy 

as accommodative and the “measured pace” language.  However, the rationale section 

of Alternative C would convey greater concerns about inflation than the comparable 

portion of Alternative B.  As always, the Committee could choose to use the rationale 

language from one alternative with the assessment of risks language from another, or 

it could adopt different language altogether.    

(10) The Committee might believe that a 25 basis point firming of policy at this 

meeting is appropriate for a number of reasons.  In the staff forecast, output remains 

near potential, and core inflation, though boosted for a time by the indirect effects of 

higher energy prices, ends the projection period near 1¾ percent—a level that many 

members may see as compatible with their price stability objective.  If the Committee 

believes the Greenbook forecast is plausible and acceptable, then it would probably 

find the 25 basis point policy firming at this meeting assumed in that projection to be 

attractive.  Put a bit differently, the Committee may see the current constellation of 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 14 of 42



asset prices and interest rates in financial markets as likely to be consistent with output 

running near potential and inflation remaining contained.  If so, then it might want to 

ratify market expectations of a further 25 basis point tightening at this meeting.  Of 

course, should the Committee’s outlook have changed significantly since the 

November meeting, it might wish to select a different setting for its policy instrument 

than assumed in the alternatives discussed below.     

Alternative B 

(11) The Committee may favor the statement language of Alternative B if it 

thinks that somewhat higher federal funds rates are likely to prove necessary to limit 

pressures on resources and promote price stability but also believes that this 

tightening phase could be ending fairly soon.  The resilience of the economy in the 

face of hurricane-related disruptions, already limited margins of slack in resource 

markets, and the pressures on inflation from elevated energy prices may incline the 

Committee to believe that additional firming will probably be necessary even after a 

25 basis point move at this meeting.  But the Committee may be of the view that, with 

policy accommodation now significantly reduced, the appropriate timing and extent 

of additional policy firming are becoming more uncertain.  Declines in energy prices 

and inflation expectations from their recent peaks may have eased members’ concerns 

about the inflation outlook.  And the real federal funds rate (as measured using lagged 

inflation to proxy for inflation expectations) is now within the range of staff estimates 

of its equilibrium value (Chart 5).  Moreover, with a 25 basis point tightening at this 

meeting, the federal funds rate would be above the range of prescriptions from policy 

rules based on a target for inflation of 1½ percent (Chart 6), and one more tightening 

would bring the rate to the top of the range that the rules would call for even in the 

second half of next year.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter. 
   

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

(12) The rationale portion of the statement for Alternative B notes that the 

expansion in economic activity appears solid despite elevated energy prices and 

disruptions related to the hurricanes.  The reference to policy accommodation has 

been dropped:  If the federal funds rate is seen as nearing its equilibrium value, the 

Committee may no longer wish to suggest that policy accommodation is boosting 

growth.  Members may also want to take this opportunity to remove the reference to 

the support to economic activity provided by robust underlying growth in 

productivity.  In assessing inflation, the Committee may want to acknowledge the 

relatively benign core inflation readings in recent months and again indicate that 

longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.  However, given the apparent 

underlying strength of aggregate demand, members may want to note that “possible 

increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to 

add to inflation pressures.”   

(13) The assessment of risks portion of the statement for Alternative B resolves 

some of the complications and tensions that have arisen in the current language.  It 

starts by removing the arguably tautological statement that “appropriate policy” 

should keep the risks to sustainable growth and price stability balanced, and it also 

drops the indication that “policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is 

likely to be measured.”  Instead, the assessment notes that “some further measured 

policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to both price stability and 

sustainable economic growth roughly in balance.”  The Committee may find this 

formulation attractive because it simplifies the existing wording considerably but does 

not greatly change its message regarding the likely near-term path for policy.  If the 

Committee continues to expect that policy will be adjusted gradually, almost surely in 

increments of 25 basis points, then the retention of the word “measured” would seem 

appropriate.  And the use of the word “some” would suggest that the Committee 

expects that the necessary amount of additional tightening is not large.  Given the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 42



considerable uncertainty about the level of the equilibrium federal funds rate, 

members may no longer be confident that policy is accommodative, and so welcome 

the deletion of the reference to the removal of policy accommodation here as well as 

in the rationale section.  This deletion might seem even more appropriate if members 

see a possibility that the federal funds rate will need to be raised above its equilibrium 

value in order to keep inflation contained.  As in recent announcements, the 

Committee might want to emphasize that policy actions will depend on evolving 

economic conditions.  Along these lines, the last sentence in the statement notes that 

“the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain 

price stability and foster sustainable economic growth.”     

(14) Market participants uniformly expect a 25 basis point rate hike at this 

meeting.  The desk’s survey of primary dealers indicates that most anticipate deletion 

or modification of the references to accommodative policy and that about half 

anticipate that the Committee will drop or modify the “measured pace” phrase.  But 

market participants appear not to foresee a change in the formulation of the 

assessment of risks at this meeting.  Given the extent of the changes proposed for 

Alternative B, it is difficult to be confident of how the new statement will be 

interpreted by investors.  On the one hand, the rationale portion of the statement—by 

downplaying the adverse effects on activity of higher energy prices and the hurricanes, 

and pointing to increases in resource utilization as a potential source of inflation 

pressure—may be seen as somewhat hawkish, leading investors to mark up their path 

for policy.  On the other hand, the indication in the risk assessment that “some 

further measured tightening is likely to be needed” to keep risks balanced would seem 

to be roughly congruent with current market expectations for policy.  And the fact 

that the Committee was making substantial changes to the statement might be seen by 

investors as a sign that it expected to stop tightening soon.  On balance, policy 

expectations could move a little higher, causing modest increases in interest rates, 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 42



declines in stock prices, and strengthening of the dollar.  These market effects could 

be somewhat larger if the removal of the reference to “policy accommodation,” 

coupled with the concerns expressed about the potential inflationary effects of 

increases in resource utilization, led some market participants to conclude that the 

Committee’s intent was not merely to bring the real funds rate to a neutral level but 

rather to move toward outright policy restraint.   

Alternative C 

(15) Should the Committee be particularly concerned about the inflation outlook 

and still see the stance of policy as accommodative, it may prefer Alternative C.  While 

energy prices have eased this fall, they remain much higher than a year ago, and other 

commodity prices have increased as well.  And although labor costs have generally 

been well-behaved of late, the Committee may believe that labor market slack has 

been essentially eliminated.  Aggregate demand has proven quite resilient in the face 

of higher interest rates and hurricane-related disruptions, and it will be boosted 

further in coming quarters by rebuilding in the Gulf region.  Given this apparent 

momentum to economic activity, members may be concerned about the risk that the 

short-term equilibrium real federal funds rate could be considerably higher than most 

of the staff estimates and aggregate demand could significantly overshoot the 

economy’s potential.  Moreover, in current circumstances the Committee may be 

concerned that it will need to boost the federal funds rate to a level above its 

equilibrium if the temporary boost to inflation caused by the run-up in energy and 

other commodity prices begins to be built into expected inflation along the lines of 

the “deteriorating inflation expectations” alternative Greenbook scenario.  As a result, 

the Committee may believe that it is premature to give a signal that the end of this 

policy tightening phase is in sight.    

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 42



(16)   If the Committee takes this view, then it might be inclined to retain some 

of the statement language used at its last meeting.  Such a statement could start by 

indicating that the economic expansion remains vigorous.  Given the strength seen in 

underlying aggregate demand and the possible upward pressures on inflation, the 

statement might continue to characterize the stance of policy as accommodative.  The 

inflation discussion could note that “relatively high levels of resource utilization as 

well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.”  The 

reference to the relatively high levels of resource utilization, in contrast to the 

concerns about possible increases in resource utilization expressed in Alternative B, 

would indicate greater concern about pressures on inflation arising from this source 

and might suggest that monetary policy now would be oriented particularly toward 

slowing growth in aggregate demand to a pace at or below that of potential output.  

The assessment of risks portion of the statement could again indicate that, with 

“appropriate policy,” the risks to both of the Committee’s dual objectives should be 

kept roughly balanced and that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured 

pace. 

(17) Release of the statement for Alternative C would lead market participants to 

boost noticeably their expectations for policy tightening.  As noted previously, 

investors appear to have put some odds on the Committee dropping or modifying the 

“accommodation” and “measured pace” phrases at this meeting as a prelude to 

winding up this tightening phase.  Moreover, the concerns expressed about the 

“relatively high levels of resource utilization” would come as a surprise to investors.  

Regarding near-term expectations, the retention of the “measured pace” language 

could lead investors not only to conclude that a quarter-point move in January was 

virtually certain but also to mark up appreciably the odds on a policy tightening in 

March.  And, beyond that point, the anticipated path for policy would probably 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 42



steepen as well.  Reflecting the change in policy expectations, short- and intermediate-

term interest rates would rise, stock prices decline, and the dollar appreciate.    

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(18) In the staff forecast, M2 growth is projected to rise from 4 percent in 2005 

to 4¾ percent in 2006 and 5¼ percent in 2007 (Table 2).  With monetary policy on 

hold after early next year, the substantial rise in the opportunity cost of M2 seen in 

recent years should start to unwind a bit.  Nonetheless, M2 velocity is forecast to rise 

a little further next year, reflecting lagged adjustments to higher opportunity costs, but 

flatten out in 2007.  Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is forecast 

to slow from 9 percent this year to 7¼ percent next year and 6½ percent in 2007.  

The bulk of the slowdown is in the household sector, where a moderation in the pace 

of house price appreciation is expected to damp growth in mortgage debt.  With long-

term interest rates staying near current levels, state and local government borrowing is 

projected to slow considerably as advance refunding activity tapers off.  By contrast, 

federal government debt growth is expected to pick up a bit, reflecting some 

deterioration in the budget deficit.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(19) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 4 percent.   

Risk Assessments  

B. The Committee judges that some further measured policy firming is 

likely to be needed to keep the risks to both price stability and 

sustainable economic growth roughly in balance.  In any event, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as 

needed to maintain price stability and foster sustainable economic 

growth. 

C. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy 

action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both 

sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  

With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee 

believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is 

likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to 

changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to 

maintain price stability.

 Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.

Appendix B:  Review of  Debt and Money Growth in 2005  

Total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded an estimated 9 percent in 
2005, about the same as in 2004.1  However, the composition of debt growth was 
somewhat different from the previous year, as borrowing by nonfinancial businesses 
picked up this year while federal borrowing dropped back.       

Nonfinancial businesses were able to finance the somewhat tepid rise in capital 
expenditures in 2005 in large part with the increase in internal funds generated by 
substantial profits amid this year’s solid economic expansion.  Nonetheless, business 
borrowing accelerated as net equity retirements surged, reflecting elevated merger and 
acquisition activity and a considerable rise in share buybacks.  Short-term business 
borrowing, particularly from banks, rose significantly, but issuance of long-term debt 
stayed near last year’s moderate rate.  All told, debt of nonfinancial businesses grew an 
estimated 8 percent.  In the household sector, overall debt expanded about           
10¾ percent.  Home mortgage debt grew briskly again in 2005, as fixed-rate mortgage 
rates remained low for most of the year, and house prices continued to rise rapidly 
through the third quarter.  Household bankruptcy filings spiked ahead of the new 
bankruptcy law that took effect in October, but various measures of household credit 
quality generally remained solid.  Borrowing by the Treasury moderated this year as 
higher-than-expected tax receipts contributed to a reduction in the federal budget 
deficit, even after substantial federal outlays related to Hurricane Katrina. 

M2 growth slowed in 2005, owing to the widening in the opportunity cost that 
accompanied the rise in short-term market interest rates during the year.  Although 
significantly below growth in nominal income, the expansion in M2 was a bit above 
that suggested by the historical relationship of M2 with income and opportunity cost.  
Annual M2 growth was probably buoyed by a rise in mortgage prepayments that 
began in the second quarter, by the flattening of the yield curve this year, and by 
increased currency and liquid deposit holdings in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.               

Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt 

The pace of borrowing by nonfinancial businesses picked up somewhat in 
2005, reflecting a rise in short-term borrowing.  In particular, business lending by 
commercial banks surged, with considerable increases registered by both large and 
small banks.  In survey responses throughout the year, senior loan officers reported 

                                           
1 Annual growth rates for 2005 cited in this appendix are current estimates based on 
available data.

further easing of business lending standards and terms as well as continued 
strengthening of loan demand, although the pace of these changes slowed toward the 
end of the year.  Most survey respondents attributed the stronger demand to 
borrowers’ increased financing needs for inventories and accounts receivable as well 
as for investment in plant and equipment; a substantial fraction of respondents also 
pointed to a pickup in merger and acquisition activity.  Growth in commercial paper 
outstanding was more modest, but it nonetheless picked up a little relative to 2004.  In 
contrast, net bond issuance was tepid this year, as modest capital expenditures, strong 
balance sheets and profits, and, later in the year, rising longer-term interest rates 
apparently limited the demand for longer-term financing.   

Gross equity issuance remained moderate in 2005, while net equity issuance 
dropped into deeply negative territory amid soaring equity retirement activity.  Cash-
financed mergers surged and share repurchases hit new records, spurred partly by the 
substantial liquidity that firms had accumulated in recent years.  In addition, equity 
retirements may have been boosted this year by repatriated earnings from foreign 
subsidiaries under a temporary tax break.     

Commercial mortgage debt grew rapidly in 2005, owing to improved 
fundamentals in the commercial real estate market.  Rents on commercial properties 
rose this year following significant declines earlier in the decade, vacancy rates edged a 
bit lower, and nonresidential construction picked up.  Gross issuance of commercial- 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) has likely reached a record pace in the fourth 
quarter, prompting a modest increase in spreads.  Credit quality appeared to remain 
solid, as delinquency rates for commercial mortgages held by banks and for those 
pooled into CMBS trended down over the year, while delinquencies for mortgages 
held by insurance companies remained low.  

Outside of the automobile and airline sectors, indicators of credit quality for 
nonfinancial companies remained quite favorable in 2005, reflecting robust profits 
and solid economic expansion.  Although the downgrades of the debt of General 
Motors and Ford garnered a lot of attention over the course of the year, the net 
proportion of total outstanding corporate debt that was downgraded this year was 
relatively small.  After trending down over most of the year, the six-month trailing 
bond default rate moved up noticeably in the fall, owing in part to the bankruptcies of 
Delta and Northwest Airlines, as well as Delphi, the largest auto parts supplier.  While 
these bankruptcies were largely anticipated, their timing may have been advanced to 
avoid changes in the federal bankruptcy code that became effective in October.  
Despite these high-profile difficulties, expected defaults over the coming year, as 
estimated by KMV, are quite low.  Risk spreads on corporate bonds were consistent 
with this relatively upbeat assessment of credit quality and remained generally low 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 42



throughout the year.  Spreads of speculative-grade corporate yields over comparable-
maturity Treasury yields rose a good bit in the spring amid reports of troubles at GM 
and Ford and concerns that high energy prices could damp the economic expansion, 
but a substantial portion of that increase was subsequently reversed.  Spreads on 
investment-grade corporate securities widened modestly through the spring and were 
little changed thereafter.  Strains in the credit derivatives markets were also evident in 
the spring, particularly following the sharp change in default correlation implied by 
the prices of tranches of synthetic collateralized debt obligations, but these strains 
subsequently eased.       

In 2005, household debt expanded nearly 11 percent, about the same brisk pace 
registered in 2004.  House price appreciation remained robust through the first three 
quarters of the year, and home mortgage debt continued its rapid growth.  Meanwhile, 
consumer credit expanded again at a modest pace this year.  Overall, the expansion in 
household debt outpaced the growth in disposable personal income; as a result, the 
financial obligations ratio edged higher, although it remains below the peak it reached 
earlier this decade.     

Households stampeded to file for bankruptcy in the weeks leading up to 
October 17, the date when the new bankruptcy law took effect.  The law was designed 
to make it more difficult for households to discharge their debts through Chapter 7 
filings.  Including the elevated filings during the spring, when the legislation was 
passed, bankruptcy reform appears to have boosted filings by about 750,000.  Since 
the new law became effective, filings have been significantly below their average of 
recent years.  The surge in bankruptcies does not seem to signal a deterioration in 
household credit quality, as various measures of delinquencies remained relatively low 
this year.  Nonetheless, chargeoffs on consumer loans are widely expected to jump in 
the fourth quarter, reflecting the surge in bankruptcies.  Consistent with that 
expectation, some large banks stated in their third-quarter earnings reports that they 
had increased provisioning for losses on consumer loans, especially credit card loans.  
When asked about the impact of the new legislation, respondents to the October 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that they expected lower credit losses 
on new loans to households going forward.  The survey respondents generally 
reported that they did not foresee changing their lending policies, nor did they foresee 
a change in loan demand from their existing customers as a result of the new 
bankruptcy law.                                

The expansion in households’ assets outstripped the increase in household debt 
through the third quarter of 2005, and the ratio of household net worth to disposable 
personal income moved a bit further above its long-run average.  Household wealth 
was boosted by the substantial home price appreciation through the first three 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 40 of 42



quarters of this year and by moderate gains in equity prices.  Net purchases of equity 
mutual funds were subdued, with the bulk of the net inflows going to international 
funds.  Net purchases of bond mutual funds were relatively strong. 

Financing activity by state and local governments picked up in 2005.  Gross 
issuance of municipal securities was brisk through the third quarter, supported by 
relatively low intermediate- and long-term interest rates.  Advance refundings were 
elevated over this period relative to last year, but as interest rates moved higher in the 
fourth quarter, refunding issues slowed significantly.  The bulk of the new-capital 
issuance reportedly was earmarked for education-related projects.  Credit quality in 
the state and local sector generally remained stable over the year.  Reflecting the 
difficulties of GM and Ford, the obligations of numerous municipal issuers in 
Michigan, most recently the city of Detroit, were downgraded this year.  In addition, 
several hurricane-related downgrades were made in the fourth quarter, and some 
bonds from the affected regions remain on watch.  Despite these isolated troubles, 
rating upgrades slightly outpaced downgrades in 2005.   

Borrowing by the Treasury moderated somewhat in calendar year 2005, with 
federal debt rising 7 percent.  The improvement reflected a surge in tax receipts, 
which contributed to a reduction in the budget deficit.  On net, the federal deficit is 
expected to total about $325 billion this year, down from around $400 billion in 2004.  
As widely anticipated, the Treasury announced in August that it would reintroduce 
regular semiannual issuance of a thirty-year nominal bond; the first such auction will 
occur on February 9, 2006.  The federal debt ceiling did not need to be raised this 
year, but staff estimates suggest that debt subject to limit could reach the ceiling 
during the first quarter of next year.       

Bank Credit 

Commercial bank credit expanded briskly again in 2005, rising about 
10¼ percent, quite a bit above the growth in total domestic nonfinancial sector debt.  
Commercial and industrial loan growth jumped to 14 percent, the fastest pace in more 
than two decades.  As noted above, loan officers reported in quarterly surveys that 
they had eased terms and standards on business loans this year and that demand had 
strengthened.  Real estate lending by banks was also brisk again this year, but cooled 
somewhat in the fourth quarter as longer-term interest rates backed up.  In contrast, 
after a strong first-quarter expansion, consumer loans on banks’ books rose more 
moderately over the balance of the year.                     

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 41 of 42



M2 Monetary Aggregate2 

 M2 rose 4 percent in 2005, significantly less than the growth in nominal 
income and the lowest annual rate of expansion in about a decade.  Reflecting the 
tightening in the stance of monetary policy over the year, the opportunity cost of 
holding M2 assets increased significantly as changes in rates on M2 assets lagged those 
in market rates, as is typical.  Consequently, growth in liquid deposits was damped 
considerably after a double-digit expansion over the previous several years.  Some 
offset was provided by a rapid increase in small time deposits, rates on which 
remained better aligned with short-term market rates.  After having contracted sharply 
in the past couple of years, retail money market mutual fund shares were about flat on 
net, as the relative return on such balances improved.     

M2 growth did not slow quite as much as would be expected based on its 
historical relationship with nominal income and opportunity cost, likely reflecting, at 
least in part, several identifiable factors.  First, relatively low longer-term interest rates 
resulted in a mild pickup in mortgage prepayments beginning in the second quarter.  
Mortgage prepayment activity tends to boost M2 because some of the funds are held 
in liquid deposits for a time before being distributed to holders of mortgage backed 
securities.  Second, the substantial flattening of the yield curve this year may have left 
households relatively less tempted to seek returns by shifting assets out of deposits in 
favor of longer-term instruments.  Finally, Hurricane Katrina likely added a little to 
the growth rate of M2 this year, as funds for living expenses provided by the federal 
government to displaced households, funds advanced by insurance companies, and a 
rise in currency usage probably buoyed M2 over the last four months of the year.  

                                           
2 The Board announced in November that it would cease compilation and publication of the 
M3 monetary aggregate in March 2006.
