RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

SUMMARY 

Financial market conditions generally became more supportive of economic 

activity over the intermeeting period, as investor sentiment improved and strains in 

several markets eased further.  Equity markets rallied in response to second-quarter 

earnings reports that were substantially stronger than analysts had expected and other 

indications that the economy may be stabilizing.  Meanwhile, despite the near failure 

of a major middle-market lender in July, the yields and spreads on corporate debt 

declined, credit default swap (CDS) spreads narrowed, and conditions in short-term 

funding markets continued to improve.  Rates on conforming fixed-rate mortgages 

decreased somewhat, and the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities 

(CMBS) showed some limited signs of recovery following the inclusion of legacy 

CMBS in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and the release of 

additional details regarding the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP).  

In spite of these improvements, however, bank credit is still very tight, and the 

functioning of some financial markets remains strained. 

In reaction to earnings reports, generally mixed economic data, and various 

Federal Reserve communications, policy expectations and yields on Treasury coupon 

securities were somewhat volatile over the intermeeting period; on net, however, both 

the expected path of the federal funds rate and the nominal yield curve were little 

changed.   

In the second quarter, as in the first, household debt shrank a bit, while debt of 

nonfinancial businesses was essentially unchanged.  Nonetheless, owing to a very large 

expansion of government borrowing, the growth of total domestic nonfinancial sector

debt increased in the second quarter.  Commercial bank credit contracted across all 

major loan categories, and banks further tightened standards and terms on loans to 

businesses and households over the past three months.  M2 fell in July, as investors 

unwound further the shift toward safe monetary assets that occurred during the 

height of the crisis. 

International financial markets continued to exhibit signs of improved sentiment 

and decreased risk aversion over the intermeeting period.  Global stock markets rose, 

and the dollar depreciated somewhat as investors’ demand for foreign assets 

increased.  

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

The Committee’s decisions at its June FOMC meeting to leave the target range 

for the federal funds rate unchanged and to maintain the size of the large-scale asset 

purchase (LSAP) programs were largely anticipated.  However, investors had 

reportedly placed some odds on the Committee increasing the size of the Treasury or 

mortgage-backed security (MBS) purchase programs.  In addition, a number of 

analysts interpreted the statement as suggesting that the Committee believed 

economic activity to be in the process of bottoming out.  Accordingly, nominal 

Treasury yields and rates on longer-dated Eurodollar futures contracts rose 

moderately following the statement.  The release of the minutes on July 15 occasioned 

little additional market reaction, but monetary policy expectations declined during the 

Chairman’s testimony on July 21, as investors reportedly took note of his remark that 

“the FOMC believes that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be 

appropriate for an extended period.”  FOMC communication over the period also 

seemed to contribute to greater market confidence that the Committee had the tools 

necessary to withdraw policy accommodation in a smooth and timely manner when 

needed.

1 Over the intermeeting period, RBC Capital Markets and Nomura Securities International 
were added to the list of primary dealers and thus were included in this survey for the first 
time, along with Jefferies & Company, which was added to the list of primary dealers 
during last period.  Dresdner Kleinwort Securities withdrew its name from the list of 
primary dealers in late June. 

2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.16 percent over the intermeeting period, and its 
intraday volatility averaged 6 basis points.  The changes in Regulation D that were 
implemented on July 2 appeared to have only limited effects on the overnight federal funds 
market.  Federal funds trading volumes spiked in early July following the change to 
Regulation D but subsequently returned to their recent ranges. 

Other incoming economic information had little net effect on policy expectations, 

and the market-implied path of the federal funds rate ended the period about the 

same as at the time of the June FOMC meeting (Chart 1).  Futures quotes, along with 

the staff’s usual assumptions regarding term premiums, still suggest that market 

participants expect the target rate to remain within its current range until the first 

quarter of 2010.  However, term premiums may well be larger than assumed by the 

staff, implying a lower expected path of policy than that depicted in Chart 1.  Indeed, 

most respondents to the Desk’s dealer survey in August anticipated that the federal 

funds rate would remain in its current range until at least the fourth quarter of next 

year, as they did in the June survey.1, 2 

Yields on Treasury coupon securities were somewhat volatile, responding to 

Federal Reserve communications, better-than-expected corporate earnings reports, 

and economic data that were mixed relative to expectations.  Still, on balance over the 

intermeeting period, the nominal yield curve was largely unchanged, with only a small 

upward shift in long-term yields.  Implied volatility of long-term interest rates 

moderated, although it remains relatively high. 

Near-term inflation compensation fell early in the intermeeting period, partly due 

to a weak employment report and declines in energy prices.  Although it subsequently 

retraced a portion of this drop, inflation compensation for the next five years was

down 9 basis points on balance over the intermeeting period.  Meanwhile, ten-year 

inflation compensation increased 13 basis points.  Those changes resulted in an 

increase of 38 basis points in the five-year forward measure of inflation 

compensation.3   Liquidity in the TIPS market reportedly continues to be poor.  

Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations held steady over the period.  

Short-run measures of inflation expectations were also little changed; the median 

forecast of core PCE inflation through 2011 from the primary dealer survey registered 

a small uptick while near-term inflation expectations measured by the 

Reuters/Michigan survey fell slightly over the period. 

The Treasury auctioned $252 billion in coupon securities across the term structure 

during the intermeeting period, and its net marketable debt (including bills and 

coupon securities) increased by $216 billion.  Several of the auctions were for record 

amounts, and—apart from two tepid receptions in late July—demand was reportedly 

stronger than market participants had anticipated.  Measures of foreign participation 

mostly continued to suggest solid demand from abroad.4   

CAPITAL MARKETS 

Amid signs of improvement in the economic outlook, broad equity indexes rose 

significantly, ending the intermeeting period about 11 to 12 percent higher (Chart 2).  
                                           
3 There is some dispersion in readings from various market-based measures of inflation 
compensation this period.  The figures reported in the text are based on Board staff’s usual 
calculations from fitted off-the-run TIPS and nominal yield curves, and information from 
the inflation-swaps market is generally consistent with these readings.  Barclay’s measures 
of break-even inflation (which are based on on-the-run yields) show the same general 
pattern but suggest a smaller increase in the five-year forward rate. 

4 In its August refunding statement, the Treasury announced that auction sizes would likely 
continue to rise gradually over the medium term.  It also reaffirmed its commitment to 
regular and predictable TIPS issuance and reported that it would consider replacing 20-year 
TIPS with 30-year TIPS.  Finally, it announced that it expected to reach the statutory debt 
ceiling in the fourth quarter of this calendar year.

5 On June 30, the FDIC implemented a special assessment of 5 basis points on assets less 
Tier 1 capital at insured institutions, which significantly affected the earnings of some 
banks. 

Earnings in the second quarter were substantially better than analysts had anticipated, 

with about three-quarters of reports exceeding expectations, often by large margins.  

Reported revenues were close to analysts’ estimates on average, suggesting that the 

earnings surprises reflected larger-than-expected cost reductions.  Implied volatility of 

equity prices, as measured by the VIX index, declined 5 percentage points to about 

the levels that prevailed in early 2008, and the equity premium—measured by the 

staff’s estimate of the expected real equity return over the next ten years relative to the 

real 10-year Treasury yield—continued to narrow, although it remained high by 

historical standards. 

In the financial sector, second-quarter earnings results were mixed.  Several large 

banking organizations reported higher-than-expected profits, mainly due to revenues 

from investment banking, trading activities, and fees from the wave of mortgage 

refinancing during the spring.  Although regional banks generally have higher 

exposure to commercial real estate than larger banks, the regional-bank sector 

generally met earnings expectations.  Within this sector however, earnings varied 

widely.  Overall, bank profits in the second quarter were weighed down by high 

provisions for loan and lease losses as well as a number of one-time charges.5  

Meanwhile, earnings reports for insurance companies generally met expectations.  

Stocks of banks and insurance companies outperformed the broader market, and, in 

general, the CDS spreads for such institutions narrowed considerably. 

Inflows into bond mutual funds increased in recent months, and yields on 

investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds continued their steep decline, 

producing a further narrowing of spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury issues 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 7 of 71



 

 

over the intermeeting period.  Indexes of corporate CDS spreads, which had widened 

somewhat in early June, retreated to near their pre-Lehman bankruptcy levels.  

Despite prominent budget problems at some state and local governments, yields on 

municipal bonds were down modestly, and gross issuance of municipal debt was solid. 

Nonfinancial corporate bond issuance remained solid in June and July.  However, 

commercial paper issuance continued to decline, and commercial and industrial (C&I) 

lending registered another significant drop, leading to a slight decrease in the overall 

pace of net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations in July.  Meanwhile, debt 

issuance by financial firms remained sluggish, and issuance through the Temporary 

Liquidity Guarantee Program declined further.  Equity issuance in both the financial 

and nonfinancial sectors was weak in July. 

Auctions of agency debt securities were generally well received during the 

intermeeting period.  Spreads on senior agency debt narrowed slightly, reportedly due 

in part to continuing Federal Reserve purchases.  On July 10, Freddie Mac announced 

that it would tender offers for all of its $4.4 billion of outstanding subordinated debt, 

and it subsequently reported purchasing about 86 percent of these issues.  The firm 

reportedly viewed the offer as a means of retiring a portion of its liabilities at relatively 

low cost.  Some market participants expected that a similar announcement from 

Fannie Mae could be forthcoming, and the prices of agency subordinated debt 

climbed. 

Spreads on highly rated tranches of CDS indexes on CMBS narrowed over the 

intermeeting period, as market participants focused on the expansion of the TALF to 

cover legacy CMBS, as well as on additional details released by the Treasury regarding 

the PPIP.  Nevertheless, the market for new-issue CMBS was still moribund.  

Commercial real estate markets remained under considerable stress, as sales of 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 8 of 71



 

 

commercial properties continued to drop in the second quarter, the delinquency rate 

on securitized commercial mortgages rose further, and price indexes fell to about two-

thirds of their peak level from late 2007. 

Interest rates on 30-year conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages declined to 

about 5¼ percent over the period but remained higher than they were from January 

through April.  Spreads between primary mortgage rates and yields on agency MBS 

narrowed somewhat to about 50 basis points, while spreads between MBS and (on-

the-run) ten-year Treasury yields were little changed at about 100 basis points.  

Following the release of the minutes, which noted that the FOMC had discussed 

possible purchases of agency MBS backed by adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) under 

the MBS LSAP program, secondary-market spreads on ARM products reportedly 

narrowed.  However, spreads for adjustable-rate mortgages remained elevated, and 

applications for such loans, though slightly higher than in June, stayed at a very low 

level.  Agency MBS issuance rose slightly in May, but the private-label RMBS market 

remains closed. 

Conditions in the consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) market were roughly 

stable over the period.  Spreads of AAA-rated consumer ABS to swaps were 

unchanged at levels comparable to those in the first half of 2008, and the recent 

volume of ABS issuance—most of which has been facilitated by the TALF—has been 

nearing levels observed prior to the second half 2008.  Nevertheless, interest rates on 

consumer loans have yet to retreat, and consumer debt growth is estimated to have 

remained negative through the second quarter. 

MARKET FUNCTIONING 

Measures of functioning and liquidity in most financial markets improved further 

over the intermeeting period.  Conditions in short-term funding markets continued to

6 The Federal Reserve’s Treasury LSAP program may have contributed in part to the decline 
in the magnitude of fitting errors of late, as this program has utilized fitted yield curves as 
one benchmark in judging securities that are relatively attractive for purchase. 

7 After obtaining the $3 billion in commitments from lenders, CIT received the minimum 
required participation in a cash tender offer for its outstanding floating rate senior notes 
due August 17, 2009.  CIT reported that, had the tender offer not been successful, it would 
likely not have been able to make the August 17 maturity payment on the notes. Still, the 
longer-term prospects for CIT remained uncertain, its common equity price hovered 
around $1 per share, its CDS spreads widened up to 5000 basis points, and bid-asked 
spreads on its debt surged.   

 

recover, as spreads between three- and six-month Libor rates and overnight index 

swaps (OIS) edged down, and participation in Federal Reserve liquidity programs 

declined further (Chart 3).  Bid-asked spreads and haircuts for most types of 

transactions in the repo market also ticked down.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated 

commercial paper and AA-rated asset-backed commercial paper were little changed 

since late June, remaining at the low end of their ranges over the past two years.  In 

Treasury markets, a decline in the fitting errors of staff nominal yield-curve models 

suggested that investors were increasingly willing and able to engage in arbitrage.6  

Still, trading volumes reportedly remained low, although they picked up somewhat 

since June, and the elevated spread between on- and off-the-run ten-year yields 

pointed to continued strains.  Quarter-end pressures facing financial institutions in 

late June appeared to be quite modest. 

In mid-July, investors became increasingly concerned about the financial 

condition of CIT Group, one of the largest lenders to middle-market firms, as it 

appeared potentially unable to roll over maturing debt and failed to receive public 

support.  Subsequent negotiations with bondholders succeeded in procuring $3 billion 

in private rescue financing, which may have averted a near-term default.7  Broader 

financial markets appear to have been largely unaffected by these developments.

The corporate bond market continued to function reasonably well.  The basis 

between the CDX investment-grade index of CDS spreads and investment-grade 

corporate bond spreads—a rough gauge of possible arbitrage opportunities in 

corporate debt markets—narrowed further, and the range of quotes reported by CDS 

dealers tightened.  Some further improvements occurred in the leveraged loan market, 

with average bid prices rising about 4 percent and bid-ask spreads falling by about 35 

basis points over the intermeeting period.  Although conditions in this market have 

improved substantially in recent months, they remain quite impaired relative to pre-

crisis experience. 

Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Reserve assets were little changed at 

about $2 trillion, with an increase in securities purchased under the LSAP program 

about offsetting declines in credit supplied under liquidity facilities.  (See box entitled 

“Balance Sheet Developments During the Intermeeting Period.”)  In the most recent 

primary dealer survey, respondents placed very low odds on increases in the size of 

the LSAP program at the upcoming FOMC meeting.  Usage of most of the System’s 

liquidity facilities shrank further, although TALF credit continued to expand, with the 

first extensions of CMBS-backed loans occurring in July.  On June 25, the Federal 

Reserve announced extensions of and modifications to a number of its liquidity 

programs.  Market participants reportedly viewed these actions as appropriate given 

the recent improvement in financial conditions, and the response in financial markets 

was minimal. 

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 

On net, foreign stock markets rose and the dollar depreciated mildly against most 

currencies over the intermeeting period (Chart 4).  European and Japanese stock 

indexes increased 8 to 10 percent, as positive U.S. earnings reports and news of strong 

growth in emerging Asia lifted investor sentiment since the June FOMC meeting.  

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 12 of 71



Balance Sheet Developments During the Intermeeting Period 

Since the June FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve’s total assets have edged 
just below $2 trillion and their composition has continued to shift.1  As a result of 
the ongoing asset purchases, securities held outright increased $149 billion, but this 
increase was more than offset by a $177 billion decrease in lending through 
liquidity and credit facilities. 

The Open Market Desk purchased $60 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, 
$14 billion in agency debt securities, and $76 billion in agency mortgage-backed 
securities during the intermeeting period.2  In contrast, most of the System’s 
liquidity and credit programs contracted further, likely reflecting continued 
improvements in global bank funding markets.  Term auction credit declined 
$49 billion, foreign central bank liquidity swaps declined $46 billion, and primary 
credit declined $6 billion.  Lending under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility 
remained at zero, and securities lent through the Term Securities Lending Facility 
(TSLF)—which do not affect on-balance sheet assets because the Federal Reserve 
retains ownership of the securities lent—fell by $4 billion to $3 billion, the lowest 
level since the inception of the program.   

The facilities aimed either directly or indirectly at the commercial paper market 
also declined.  Credit extended through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
(CPFF) declined $65 billion, as a large amount of maturing commercial paper was 
not rolled over in the facility.  This decline is likely a sign, at least in part, of some 
substitution of longer-term credit for commercial paper, as well as some 
deleveraging by commercial paper issuers.  Loans extended under the Asset-Backed 
Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) 
decreased by $17 billion, leaving only $113 million outstanding.  In contrast to the 
other facilities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which 
conducted two subscriptions during the intermeeting period, expanded in size.  The 
first loan subscription, totaling $5 billion, financed the issuance of asset-backed 
securities collateralized by auto, credit card, student, small business, and servicing 
advance loans.  The second loan subscription, totaling $636 million, was associated 
with the first legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) operation.3

facility.  The closing date of this operation is August 13, 2009.

Regarding other assets, the second-quarter revaluation of the Maiden Lane 
portfolios led to an unrealized revaluation net gain of $1.35 billion on the three 
Maiden Lane portfolios, largely because of a substantial upward revision in 
valuation of Maiden Lane III assets that more than offset continued declines in 
valuations of the Maiden Lane and Maiden Lane III portfolios.  The reported value 
of the revolving AIG credit extension was reduced by a loan adjustment of about 
$1.3 billion to reflect the lower interest earnings from the loan related to the most 
recent modification of the terms of the facility in April 2009. 

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account decreased $70 billion.  The Treasury’s supplementary financing 
account remained unchanged at $200 billion, while most other categories recorded 
small changes.  The net result of these changes to the balance sheet was an increase 
of $39 billion in reserve balances of depository institutions 

Following the June FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve announced extensions 
of and modifications to a number of its liquidity programs and credit facilities. 
Specifically, the Federal Reserve approved extension through February 1, 2010, of 
the AMLF, CPFF, PDCF, TSLF, and the foreign central bank liquidity swaps.4 
Furthermore, it was announced that Term Auction Facility (TAF) auction amounts 
would be reduced gradually if market conditions continued to improve.  Auction 
amounts were set at $125 billion for the July auctions, down from $150 billion 
previously, and have been set at $100 billion for the August auctions.  

 

  

                                           
4 TSLF Schedule 1 auctions and TSLF Options Program auctions were suspended, and the frequency as well 

as the offered amount of Schedule 2 TSLF auctions was reduced.  The authorization for the Money Market 
Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) was not extended, and an additional administrative criterion was 
established for use of the AMLF.  The expiration date for the TALF currently remains set at December 31, 
2009.  The TAF does not have a fixed expiration date.

European financial stocks, which were further boosted by early reports of better-than-

expected profits by some European banks, increased more than 20 percent.  The 

improvement in global sentiment appeared to encourage investors to move further 

into foreign assets, placing some downward pressure on the dollar.  The major 

currencies index of the dollar declined 3¼ percent since the June FOMC meeting.  

The June 24 auction by the European Central Bank (ECB) of unlimited one-year 

funds at a fixed rate of 1 percent was met with very strong demand.  Banks bid for a 

record €442 billion in loans at the auction, increasing the ECB’s total amount of 

outstanding refinancing operations by 45 percent, and as a result the effective 

overnight interest rate in the euro area has declined to about 35 basis points.  The 

ECB also began its purchases of covered bonds, buying €5 billion of bonds so far; 

yields on intermediate-term European covered bonds have declined by roughly 20 

basis points since the purchases began in early July.  In contrast, yields on longer-

dated gilts rose as much as 19 basis points immediately after the Bank of England 

(BOE) surprised markets by leaving the size of its Asset Purchase Facility (APF) 

unchanged at £125 billion at its July Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.  

Gilt yields continued to edge higher over July as the bank’s purchases neared their 

limit under the facility; however, the completion of purchases at the end of July, 

which was expected, had little apparent impact on the gilt market.  Market participants 

were divided as to whether the BOE would authorize any further purchases at its 

August meeting, but the MPC did decide to renew its purchases.  Citing the depth of 

the recession, the BOE raised the size of the APF to £175 billion and widened the set 

of gilts it would purchase, stating that it expected to conduct its additional purchases 

over the next three months.  Benchmark gilt yields fell about 20 basis points on the 

announcement.   On net, benchmark yields in the United Kingdom are about 

unchanged when compared to their levels at the time of the June FOMC, while they 

have declined by 8 basis points in the euro area.

Mutual fund flows to the emerging markets turned positive again after a brief 

period of outflows in late June, and the dollar depreciated about 1¼ percent against 

the currencies of our other important trading partners.  The larger emerging Asian 

and Latin American stock markets increased 12 to 18 percent, and EMBI Global 

spreads declined by about 100 basis points.  Several Latin American central banks 

lowered their policy rates further over the intermeeting period, and but have signaled 

that they intend to pause before considering any further reductions.   

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervened  

 

 since announcing in March that it would purchase foreign assets as part of 

its monetary policy operations; . 

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY 

The level of private domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to have 

declined again in the second quarter.  Household debt is estimated to have dropped at 

an annual rate of 1¼ percent, and nonfinancial business debt appears to have been 

essentially unchanged (Chart 5).  In contrast, the federal government issued debt at a 

rapid clip, and state and local government debt expanded moderately.  All told, the 

growth rate of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have increased from 

an annual rate of about 4 percent in the first quarter of this year to 5½ percent in the 

second quarter.   

Commercial bank credit contracted at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the second 

quarter and 13¼ percent in July.  The declines in June and July were widespread 

across all major loan categories but were particularly pronounced for C&I loans amid 

subdued originations and broad-based paydowns that may reflect, in part, substitution 

into bond issuance.  Commercial real estate loans also declined.  Residential real estate

loans on banks’ books dropped further, likely reflecting tighter standards, higher 

mortgage rates in recent months, continued securitization activity, and additional 

reductions in the home equity credit lines of some existing customers.  The stock of 

consumer loans originated by banks decreased in June and July, amid reported weaker 

loan demand and tighter credit standards and terms.  The decline in bank credit, 

combined with further increases in core deposits, has allowed banks to pare their 

managed liabilities substantially in recent months.  Banks’ allowance for loan and lease 

losses continued to rise through late July, suggesting that banks see further 

deterioration in loan performance as likely. 

The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in July indicated that banks 

continued to tighten their lending standards and terms over the past three months on 

all major categories of loans to businesses and households.  However, the net 

percentages of banks that tightened declined further.  With respect to C&I loans, 

respondents again cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, along 

with a worsening of industry-specific problems and a reduced tolerance for risk, as the 

leading reasons for the continued tightening.  Demand for loans reportedly continued 

to weaken across all categories except for prime residential mortgages.  In response to 

a special question, most banks said that they expected lending standards to remain 

tighter than long-run norms until at least the second half of 2010; for below-

investment-grade firms and nonprime households, standards are expected to remain 

tighter for longer, with many banks reporting that standards for such borrowers will 

remain tighter than average for the foreseeable future. 

After growing at an annual rate of 13 percent in the first quarter, M2 increased at 

a rate of just 2½ percent in the second quarter and contracted at a 3½ percent rate in 

July, likely reflecting in part a reversal of safe haven demands for M2 assets that had 

boosted money growth in previous quarters.  The recent sluggishness has been 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 71



 

 

evident in all components of M2 but has been most prominent in small time deposits 

and retail money market funds, both of which have declined at double-digit rates over 

the last several months as yields on these instruments have dropped to very low levels.  

The monetary base expanded at a 24 percent rate in the second quarter, a somewhat 

less rapid pace than had been observed over previous months, and fell at a 6 percent 

rate in July; these rates reflect the declining usage of several Federal Reserve liquidity 

and credit facilities.

8 The BEA estimated in late July that real GDP declined 1 percent at an annual rate in the 
second quarter, but subsequently published data on construction and merchandise trade 
now suggest a somewhat larger decline.  

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

Information received since the June meeting suggests that the downturn in 

economic activity is drawing to a close.  The staff estimates that real GDP declined  

at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the second quarter, compared with a 6½ percent 

contraction in the first quarter.8  As in June, the staff outlook assumes that the federal 

funds rate will remain at its current level for the next few years and that the Federal 

Reserve will not make any significant changes in the size or timing of its large-scale 

asset purchase (LSAP) programs.  The staff continues to anticipate that the spending 

and tax changes authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 

will contribute about 1 percentage point to the annualized growth rate of real GDP 

growth during the second half of this year and about ¾ percentage point to real GDP 

growth next year.  

In the staff’s projection, longer-term Treasury yields edge up through 2010.  

Mortgage rates are expected to increase about ¼ percentage point as spreads over 

longer-term Treasury yields widen slightly from unusually low levels.  In contrast, risk 

spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds are projected to narrow a bit more than  

½ percentage point.  With the equity risk premium also continuing to decline over 

coming quarters, stock prices are projected to rise at a brisk annual rate of about 15 

percent.  The availability of bank credit to firms and households is expected to 

improve over time but remain quite tight by historical standards.  The real foreign 

exchange value of the dollar, which declined about 2 percent over the intermeeting 

period, is assumed to fall about 2 percent annually during the remainder of this year 

and in 2010.  The current and projected price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is

9 The comprehensive NIPA revision of July 31 substantially reduced the estimated level  
of real GDP in recent quarters; thus, the staff estimates that the GDP gap is now about 
-7¾ percent, more than a percentage point wider than in the June Greenbook.   

10 Consumer spending on “food away from home” has now been moved into the services 
category of personal consumption expenditures, implying that this food item now enters 
the core PCE price index.  We estimate that this redefinition raised 2008 core PCE inflation 
by ¼ percentage point but is expected to add only 0.1 percentage point to core PCE 
inflation rates for 2009 and 2010.     

little changed from the time of the June Greenbook; based on readings from futures 

markets, the staff expects oil prices to rise gradually through the end of next year.  

Against this backdrop, the staff now expects real GDP to grow at an annual rate of 

1¼ percent during the second half of 2009.9  The unemployment rate, which rose a 

notch during the intermeeting period, is projected to reach a peak of 10 percent late 

this year.  Economic activity is expected to pick up modestly next year, with real GDP 

rising a bit more than 3 percent and the unemployment rate declining to about  

9½ percent by the end of next year.  In light of the current and prospective level of 

economic slack, the staff projects core PCE inflation to decline to an average annual 

rate of 1¼ percent in the second half of this year and to 1 percent in 2010.10  The 

corresponding rates for overall PCE inflation are projected to be 2¼ percent in the 

second half of 2009 and 1¼ percent in 2010.     

Looking further ahead, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will remain  

at its effective lower bound through 2011 and then move up to about 4 percent over 

the next two years.  The staff forecasts that real GDP will expand at an average rate of 

about 5 percent from 2011 through 2013, outpacing a rise in potential output that 

averages 2½ percent per year.  As a result, the unemployment rate declines steadily, 

falling to around 5 percent—the staff’s current estimate of the NAIRU—by late 2013.  

As real activity recovers, total PCE inflation slowly rises to about 1.4 percent by 

2013—still noticeably below the assumed long-run inflation goal of 2 percent.

11 The short-run estimates also reflect a one-quarter shift forward since the June Bluebook of 
the twelve-quarter time frame for measuring r*.  (The equilibrium real rate r* is defined as 
the rate that closes the output gap twelve quarters ahead.)  The window now stretches one 
quarter further into the recovery period, which has the effect of raising the level of 
economic activity at the end of the window and boosting r*. 

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

Measures of short-run r* for this round were influenced by two sets of 

countervailing factors.  First, the comprehensive NIPA revision lowered recent 

readings on the level of output, leading the staff to revise down substantially its 

estimate of the output gap in the second quarter to about -7½ percent.  Other things 

equal, the wider output gap tends to push short-run measures of r* lower.  Second, 

incoming data, a lower value of the dollar, an improvement in other financial market 

conditions, and a stronger forecast for foreign growth put upward pressure on short-

run measures of r*.11  The net effect of these factors depends on the model used to 

generate the r* measures and on whether or not the estimates are conditioned on the 

staff outlook.  Nonetheless, all of the r* measures are appreciably lower than the real 

federal funds rate, which currently stands at -1½ percent. 

As shown in Chart 6, the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run r* 

computed using the FRB/US model remains at about -2¾ percent.  Of the r* 

measures not conditioned on the staff outlook, those derived from the FRB/US and 

EDO models increased about 1½ percentage points to -4 and -2¼ percent, 

respectively.  Similarly, the measure of short-run r* from the small structural model 

rose by ½ percentage point and now stands at -3 percent.  In contrast, the r* estimate 

from the single-equation model and the Greenbook-consistent measure of r* from the 

EDO model declined appreciably.  In both cases, the downward revisions (of about a 

percentage point) were heavily influenced by the downward revision in the staff’s 

estimate of the output gap.

Chart 7 shows the result of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model 

that use the extended staff forecast as a starting point.  In these simulations, 

policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 

to their 2 percent inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and 

on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  As in recent Bluebooks, optimal 

monetary policy remains severely constrained by the zero lower bound, with the 

nominal funds rate remaining at the lower bound until late 2012 (black solid lines).  As 

a result, the unemployment rate stays significantly above the NAIRU until 2012, and 

core PCE inflation remains noticeably below the 2 percent goal. 

Chart 7 also displays the optimal control results that would be obtained if the 

nominal funds rate was not constrained by the zero bound (blue dashed lines).  Under 

this unconstrained policy, the funds rate falls to about -6 percent next year and stays 

below zero until mid-2012, while the real funds rate decreases to about -7¾ percent in 

2010.  These trajectories imply somewhat less negative values for the nominal and real 

funds rate than depicted in the previous Bluebook.  This change reflects both a higher 

average rate of inflation in the extended staff projection and a shift forward in the 

start of the simulation period.  Relative to the constrained policy, the unconstrained 

path for the funds rate leads over the next two years to a reduction of about 1½ 

percentage points in the unemployment rate.  Under this unconstrained policy, core 

PCE inflation would follow a higher trajectory but would still be noticeably lower 

than the 2 percent goal. 

As shown in Chart 8, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes that the funds rate 

stays at its effective lower bound until the end of 2011.  Consistent with the widened 

estimates of the output gap, the period over which a near-zero funds rate is prescribed 

lasts two quarters longer than in the previous Bluebook.  Financial market 

expectations for the funds rate path through the first half of 2010 appear to have

12 For this Bluebook, the expected funds rate path has been estimated from Eurodollar 
quotes—instead of the previously used forward rate agreements—as well as implied three-
month forward rates from swaps.  To facilitate comparison, the upper right panel of Chart 
8 displays the expected path and the confidence intervals for the current and previous 
Bluebooks based on the revised estimation procedure. 

shifted down by about 15 basis points since the previous Bluebook.12  Still, futures 

quotes appear to price in a significant probability that the eventual policy tightening 

could be more rapid than is suggested by FRB/US simulations with the outcome-

based rule.  As in the previous Bluebook, the 70 percent confidence intervals include a 

funds rate of 3 percent for the end of 2010. 

The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple policy 

rules.  As shown in the left-hand columns, all of the prescriptions are at the effective 

lower bound.  The right-hand columns show the prescriptions that would be implied 

by these rules if the lower bound was not imposed.  These unconstrained rules 

uniformly imply negative funds rates.  With the exception of the first-difference rule, 

the prescribed interest rates are markedly lower than in the June Bluebook, reflecting 

the downward revision in estimates of the output gap.  The funds rates implied by the 

Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules are affected most strongly by the output gap 

revision: their average second-half 2009 values decreased by about ¾ percent and 1½ 

percent, respectively, compared to the June Bluebook.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents three main policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for 

the Committee’s consideration.  A variant of B, labeled B', also is presented.  Table 1 

gives an overview of key policy elements of these alternatives, and draft statements 

are provided on the following pages. 

Each of the three main alternatives maintains an unchanged target range of 0 to ¼ 

percent for the federal funds rate, but the alternatives differ with respect to the size 

and timing of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs).  Under 

Alternative A, the Committee would increase its purchases of Treasury securities and 

potentially extend the period of time over which it expects to hold the funds rate at a 

very low rate.  Alternative B would essentially maintain the current stance of monetary 

policy while specifying a phase-out strategy for the purchases of Treasury securities.  

Under Alternative C, the Committee would trim the size of the LSAPs and shorten 

the anticipated period of time over which its target range for the funds rate would be 

likely to remain extraordinarily low.   

All of the alternatives refer to the recent improvements in financial market conditions 

and provide generally similar descriptions of the incoming information on economic 

activity and inflation, but each alternative provides a distinct characterization of the 

economic outlook.  Alternative A states that “the pace of economic contraction has 

abated significantly,” whereas Alternatives B and C adopt a somewhat more optimistic 

tone and note that “economic activity is leveling out.”  Alternative C also indicates 

that “downside risks are diminishing.”  As in June, all three alternatives reiterate the 

Committee’s expectation that inflation “will remain subdued for some time.” 

In characterizing the LSAP program, Alternatives B and C note that the Federal 

Reserve is currently in the process of buying the previously announced maximum

13 At the point when the Committee considers the strategy for completing its purchases of 
agency MBS and agency debt, it could adjust this language to indicate that these 
transactions would likely taper off into early 2010, as recommended by the Desk.  See the 
August 4, 2009, Desk memorandum “Tapering of Large-Scale Asset Purchases.” 

amount of $300 billion in Treasury securities.  These two alternatives introduce new 

language stating that the Committee has decided to “gradually slow the pace” of 

purchases to promote “a smooth transition in markets” and that these transactions are 

now expected to be completed by the end of October.  Alternative B' preserves the 

same language regarding the phase-out strategy for the current program of purchases 

of Treasury securities but indicates that the Committee is “prepared to consider 

resuming” its purchases of Treasury securities.  In contrast, Alternative A raises the 

amount of purchases of Treasury securities by $150 billion and indicates that the “full 

amount” of $450 billion will be purchased by year-end; this alternative does not 

mention a phase-out strategy for these transactions. 

Under Alternatives A and B, the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of 

agency MBS and agency debt would remain at the previously announced levels of 

$1.25 trillion and $200 billion, respectively.  However, Alternative A would indicate 

that the Committee anticipates completing the “full amount” of agency MBS 

purchases, whereas Alternative B leaves open the possibility that total purchases will 

not reach the maximum amount; moreover, by not specifying a phase-out strategy, 

this alternative preserves more scope for the Committee to choose to expand these 

purchases at a later date.  Alternative C states that the Committee has decided to 

“gradually slow the pace” of its purchases of agency MBS and agency debt and now 

anticipates that these purchases will only cumulate to about $1 trillion and $150 

billion, respectively.  All alternatives state that these transactions would be completed 

by the end of this year.13

June FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that 
the pace of economic contraction is slowing. Conditions in financial markets have generally 
improved in recent months. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but 
remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. 
Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making 
progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic 
activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy 
actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and 
market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a 
context of price stability.  

The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial 
resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation 
will remain subdued for some time. 

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate 
for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending 
and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal 
Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and 
up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve will 
buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn. The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving 
economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring 
the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and 
liquidity programs as warranted.

 August FOMC Statement – Alternative A

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June 
suggests that the pace of economic contraction has abated significantly.  
Conditions in financial markets have improved somewhat further in recent weeks.  
Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains 
constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, 
and tight credit.  Businesses appear to have made progress in bringing inventory 
stocks into better alignment with sales but are still cutting back on fixed investment 
and staffing. 

2. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial 
resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that 
inflation will remain subdued for some time. 

3. With the anticipated economic recovery likely to be weak initially and inflation 
expectations well-anchored, the Committee has decided to provide additional 
monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of Treasury securities to $450 
billion, up from the previously announced amount of as much as $300 billion.  
To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall 
conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of 
purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee 
anticipates completing the full amounts of its purchases of Treasury and 
mortgage-backed securities by year-end.  The Committee will also buy up to 
$200 billion of agency debt by the end of this year.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the 
evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  [The Committee will 
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to 
anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of 
the federal funds rate for an extended period. | The Committee anticipates that 
economic conditions are likely to warrant maintaining the 0 to ¼ percent 
target range for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2010].

August FOMC Statement – Alternative C 

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June 
suggests that economic activity is leveling out and that downside risks are 
diminishing.  Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but 
remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing 
wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and 
staffing but have made progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment 
with sales.  Meanwhile, conditions in financial markets have improved further in 
recent weeks.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the 
Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and 
institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will continue to 
contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of 
price stability.  

2. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial 
resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that 
inflation will remain subdued for some time. 

3. In view of the improved economic outlook, the Committee has judged that 
some reduction in overall monetary stimulus is appropriate.  The Committee 
now expects that its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
and agency debt will cumulate to about $1 trillion and about $150 billion, 
respectively, somewhat less than the previously announced maximum 
amounts.  The Federal Reserve is nearing completion of its purchase of roughly 
$300 billion of Treasury securities.  To promote a smooth transition in markets as 
its purchases of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS come to an 
end, the Committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these 
transactions.  Consistent with these adjustments, the Committee now expects 
that its purchases of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of 
October, and it continues to anticipate that its purchases of agency debt and 
MBS will be completed by the end of the year.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the 
evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve 
is carefully monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make 
adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.  The Committee now 
anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant maintenance of the 
current 0 to ¼ percent range for the federal funds rate at least through the end of 
this year.

14 See the August 4, 2009, Desk memorandum “Tapering of Large-Scale Asset Purchases.” 

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 

If policymakers believe that the policy stimulus already in train will likely be 

sufficient to foster a satisfactory economic recovery, the Committee could decide to 

reaffirm its forward guidance regarding the funds rate, continue implementing its 

previously announced LSAPs, and provide additional information about its plan for 

winding down purchases of Treasury securities, as in Alternative B.  Maintaining the 

current stance of monetary policy might be particularly appealing if the Committee 

shares the staff’s assessment that economic growth will gradually pick up in coming 

quarters as the financial system continues to heal and the housing sector shows 

further signs of improvement.  Since the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury 

securities are scheduled to be completed by autumn, the Committee may view this 

meeting as the appropriate time to clarify its strategy for phasing out these purchases, 

while deferring consideration of the strategy for completing its other LSAP programs 

to a subsequent meeting.  In particular, as recommended by the Desk, the Committee 

might want to slow the pace of transactions so that these purchases taper off instead 

of ending abruptly, thereby minimizing the risk of financial market dislocations.14 

While economic and financial news since June has generally been positive, the 

Committee—like the staff—may interpret this information as largely confirming its 

modal outlook for economic activity and inflation and hence may see no compelling 

reason to modify the current stance of monetary policy.  Indeed, the Greenbook-

consistent measure of short-run r* from the FRB-US model is the same as in June.  

Moreover, reiterating that the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low 

“for an extended period” remains consistent with the funds rate path implied by the 

estimated outcome-based rule (Chart 8).  Even if meeting participants believe that 

prospects for economic growth have improved somewhat further since June, the 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 38 of 71



 

 

Committee may still see considerable uncertainty about the outlook and may prefer to 

wait for more definitive signs of recovery before modifying its forward policy 

guidance. 

Policymakers may view the strength of the prospective recovery as not fully 

satisfactory, but they may nonetheless believe that providing further monetary 

stimulus through expanded LSAPs would entail costs that would likely outweigh the 

potential benefits.  For example, Committee participants may be concerned that 

additional purchases of longer-term assets could magnify the size of losses on the 

Federal Reserve’s portfolio under scenarios involving a sharp increase in short-term 

interest rates over the next few years.  Expanding the System’s purchases of Treasury 

securities might be viewed as particularly problematic if policymakers judged that such 

an announcement could trigger renewed concerns about possible future monetization 

of federal budget deficits and hence push up inflation risk premiums.  Even a modest 

increase in the size of the LSAPs might be viewed by investors as signaling a greater 

likelihood of further expansions that could threaten the viability of the Committee’s 

exit strategy. 

Alternative B indicates that the Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and 

overall amounts of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency debt and agency MBS 

but does not mention further adjustments to the purchases of Treasury securities; the 

absence of any such reference might well be seen by market analysts as suggesting that 

the Committee would not be inclined to resume large-scale purchases of Treasury 

securities even if financial or economic conditions deteriorated.  However, if 

policymakers perceive an appreciable probability that additional purchases of Treasury 

securities could become warranted in coming months, they might prefer language like 

that of Alternative B', which states that the Committee is “prepared to consider 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 71



 

 

resuming its purchases of Treasury securities in light of the evolving economic 

outlook and conditions in financial markets.”       

The release of a statement such as that suggested for Alternative B should have muted 

effects on financial markets.  The Desk’s survey of primary dealers indicates that 

investors generally expect the Committee’s statement at this meeting will include 

some reference to recent improvements in economic and financial conditions.  

Moreover, investors expect the Committee to reiterate its forward policy guidance and 

place very low odds on the announcement of any substantial change in the size of the 

Federal Reserve’s LSAP programs.  Accordingly, there would likely be little change in 

short- and long-term yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.       

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

If policymakers are concerned that the economic outlook is unacceptably weak 

and judge that additional monetary stimulus would be appropriate, the Committee 

could decide to expand the total amount of purchases of Treasury securities and to 

extend the timeframe for conducting those purchases, as in Alternative A.  Although 

the staff has marked up slightly its forecast for economic growth, the output gap in 

the Greenbook remains in excess of 7 percent over the next two years, the 

unemployment rate declines only slowly from its projected 10 percent peak, and core 

inflation hovers around 1 percent.  With protracted resource slack and inflation below 

levels seen by most participants as consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, 

this outlook suggests that further monetary stimulus might be appropriate.  According 

to the optimal control simulations depicted in Chart 7, the real federal funds rate 

would be substantially lower and would foster significantly better outcomes for 

employment and inflation were it not for the fact that the nominal funds rate is 

constrained by the effective lower bound.  Furthermore, the Committee may judge 

that signs of economic and financial stabilization are quite tentative and that

significant uncertainties remain as to the timing and extent of the economic recovery, 

perhaps along the lines of the “Intensified Financial Fragility” scenario in the 

Greenbook.  Given these considerations, the Committee might consider it 

appropriate to apply more monetary stimulus by expanding the LSAP programs. 

Even though the Committee did not modify the stance of monetary policy at the June 

meeting, policymakers may judge that an expansion of LSAPs is appropriate at the 

present juncture.  In particular, the Committee’s uncertainty about the effects of these 

purchases on the economy may have diminished since March—the last time the 

Committee adjusted the size of the LSAPs.  Also, since June investors have apparently 

become more confident about the viability of the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy, 

perhaps giving the Committee greater flexibility with regard to expanding the size of 

its balance sheet.  In these circumstances, the Committee may see increased LSAPs as 

a useful tool to strengthen aggregate demand and to promote a return of inflation to 

rates that the Committee considers most consistent with the dual mandate.   

The Committee may see expanded purchases of Treasury securities as the most 

suitable means for providing additional monetary stimulus while minimizing adverse 

effects on financial market functioning.  The current flow of the Federal Reserve’s 

purchases of Treasury securities is relatively small compared with new issuance of 

those securities, suggesting that purchases could be increased without a significant risk 

of creating market distortions.  In contrast, the Desk has already encountered 

challenges in maintaining a pace of agency MBS purchases consistent with reaching 

the previously announced maximum amount; hence, expanded purchases of those 

securities might not be feasible or desirable.  Expanded purchases of agency debt 

could generate significant distortions in the markets for those securities, especially in 

the absence of significant balance sheet growth of the housing GSEs. 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 41 of 71



 

 

An announcement along the lines of Alternative A is not expected by market 

participants and predicting the effects of such a statement is difficult.  Judging by 

recent experience, the announcement of an additional $150 billion in Treasury 

purchases is likely to reduce longer-term yields about 10 to 20 basis points.  Equity 

prices would probably edge up, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might 

well decline.  Inflation compensation could increase if the Committee’s decision 

prompted renewed investor concerns about possible monetization of the debt.  All of 

these effects could be magnified if market participants saw the increase in asset 

purchases as opening the door to yet further increases in such transactions.   

In considering ways to provide additional monetary stimulus, policymakers could also 

choose to indicate that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate 

would likely be warranted “at least through mid-2010,” rather than reiterating that 

“economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 

funds rate for an extended period.”  Futures quotes indicate that some financial 

market participants anticipate a much earlier onset of funds rate tightening than 

assumed in the Greenbook.  Thus, such an adjustment of the Committee’s forward 

policy guidance would likely cause some investors to mark down their expectations 

regarding the degree of tightening that is likely to occur over the next year or so.  

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 

If policymakers are substantially more optimistic than the staff regarding the 

economic outlook, the Committee might choose to trim the size of the LSAPs and to 

adjust its language regarding the anticipated period over which the funds rate would 

be likely to remain extraordinarily low, as in Alternative C.  Under this alternative, the 

Committee would begin a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus by announcing a 

tapering off of the LSAP program.  It would also revise its stated expectation for a 

very low federal funds rate so that it extends “at least through the end of this year.”  

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 42 of 71



 

 

This language would likely be seen by market participants as pointing to a somewhat 

earlier end to the period of very low funds rates than implied by the Committee’s 

recent statements.   

With economic activity leveling off and conditions in financial markets improving 

steadily, members may anticipate a more rapid unwinding of financial strains than 

assumed by the staff, a possibility explored in the “Faster Pace of Financial Recovery” 

scenario in the Greenbook.  Members may be especially concerned that, should 

bankers’ attitudes toward lending improve rapidly, the large amount of reserves in the 

banking system could bring about a strong expansion of bank credit, providing 

considerable stimulus to aggregate demand.  Members may believe that such risks 

would be moderated by reducing the Committee’s planned asset purchases and thus 

lowering the accumulation of reserves in the banking system. 

A less optimistic outlook for aggregate supply—especially in light of the 

comprehensive NIPA revisions—and the attendant consequences for inflation might 

also incline the Committee to begin withdrawing monetary stimulus sooner rather 

than later.  For example, the Committee might see substantial benefits of moving 

preemptively towards a firmer stance of monetary policy to help ensure that long-term 

inflation expectations do not rise above levels consistent with price stability.  (The 

“Higher Inflation Expectations” scenario in the Greenbook illustrates this possibility.)  

Indeed, survey measures of long-term inflation expectations and the five-year forward 

measure of inflation compensation have edged higher over recent months, despite 

high levels of unemployment and resource slack.  Policymakers may see a reduction in 

the Committee’s planned asset purchases as likely to reduce market concerns about 

the Federal Reserve’s strategy and capacity for winding down the LSAP program, 

reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and eventually raising the 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 43 of 71



 

 

federal funds rate.  A reduction in such concerns could help ensure that inflation 

expectations remain well anchored.            

The publication of Alternative C would come as quite a surprise to market 

participants.  The Desk’s survey indicates that primary dealers uniformly expect that 

the Committee’s statement at this meeting will reiterate the same forward policy 

guidance as in recent FOMC statements.  Only a quarter of survey participants 

indicated that they expect the federal funds rate to be raised above its effective lower 

bound by next June, while another half expect the initial rate increase to occur later 

this year, and the remainder do not expect tightening before 2011.  Thus, the release 

of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and longer-

term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, while the exchange value 

of the dollar would probably appreciate.  Forward inflation compensation might 

decline if the Committee’s decision caused investors to mark down their inflation 

expectations at longer horizons.

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

Under the Federal Reserve’s current policy approach, the size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet is driven by the evolution of its assets, specifically, the scale of 

asset purchases and demand for Federal Reserve liquidity programs and credit 

facilities.  Total liabilities are determined by total assets, and the composition of 

liabilities depends on currency demand and other factors on the liability side, with 

reserve balances determined as a residual.   

Three balance sheet scenarios are presented here; they differ in their assumptions 

regarding asset purchases.  The first scenario is a baseline scenario, which includes 

large-scale asset purchases roughly in line with the quantities previously announced by 

the FOMC:  $300 billion of Treasury securities by October; $150 billion of agency 

debt by the end of this year; and $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities 

(MBS) by the end of this year.  This baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in 

the Policy Alternatives section of this Bluebook.  The second scenario corresponds to 

Alternative A in the Policy Alternatives section, in which purchases of Treasury 

securities are increased by $150 billion to $450 billion, and the purchases continue 

through the end of this year.  The third scenario corresponds to Alternative C in the 

Policy Alternatives section, in which the total quantity of agency MBS purchases is 

reduced by $250 billion to $1 trillion.   

To construct the projections, we made assumptions about all components of the 

balance sheet other than reserve balances, which are the residual item.  Details on the 

assumptions are available in Appendix C.  On the asset side of the balance sheet, the 

baseline scenario path of large-scale asset purchases matches the assumed path in the 

Greenbook.  In this scenario, Treasury securities purchases are expected to taper off 

gradually through October and to cumulate to $300 billion.  All three scenarios 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 45 of 71



 

 

assume that the assets purchased are held to maturity and not replaced.  Reflecting 

concerns that a higher level of purchases could distort pricing and compromise 

market liquidity, agency debt purchases are projected to cumulate to $150 billion, 

somewhat less than the $200 billion announced upper limit of the program.  

Thereafter, agency debt holdings decline slowly for the remainder of the forecast 

period as they mature.  Purchases of agency MBS are scheduled to be completed by 

the end of this year; however, due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, 

agency MBS holdings under Alternatives A and B peak at $1.24 trillion in March 2010, 

a slightly lower level than the total amount purchased and a few months after 

purchases have ceased.  For the Alternative C scenario, although total purchases are 

less, the pattern for agency MBS holdings is similar, and holdings peak at $960 billion.  

For all scenarios, a slower-than-historical-average path for the prepayment of agency 

MBS implies that more than half of the agency MBS purchased are still on the balance 

sheet in 2016. 

The projections for liquidity and credit programs are the same in all three 

scenarios.  The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is assumed to 

reach a peak of $165 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2010, with 

$120 billion in three-year loans and $45 billion in five-year loans at the peak.  TALF 

loans outstanding reach zero in 2015.  The Commercial Paper Funding Facility 

(CPFF), the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity 

Facility (AMLF) and the foreign central bank liquidity swap lines are assumed to 

expire on February 1, 2010; loans outstanding from these facilities wind down to zero 

by mid-year 2010.  Credit extended to AIG and the Federal Reserve’s ownership of 

preferred stock interests in AIG reach zero by 2013.  The assets held by Maiden Lane 

LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are assumed to be sold over 

time; they reach a minimal level by 2016.  Primary, secondary, and seasonal credit sum 

to about $1 billion from the end of 2010 forward.  Only the Term Auction Facility

15 A discussion of the issues related to the SDR allocation can be found in the memo to the 
FOMC, “Implications of upcoming SDR allocations,” August 4, 2009. 

(TAF) remains sizable at the end of the forecast period.  It is projected to swell at 

year-end 2009 before dropping down to reach a steady-state level of $20 billion at the 

end of 2010.  Finally, the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate account is 

projected to increase to $27.2 billion, as a result of an assumed monetization of $25 

billion in SDRs that is expected to be implemented at the end of August.15   

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, all three scenarios 

assume that currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows at the same rate as 

the staff forecast for money stock currency through 2011 and after that point expands 

at the projected growth rate of nominal GDP in the extended Greenbook forecast.  

Consistent with the Treasury’s most recent quarterly financing estimates, the 

Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account is projected to remain at $200 billion 

through December 2009, after which point it is assumed to wind down to zero by the 

third quarter of 2010.  The U.S. Treasury’s general account is assumed to return to its 

historical target level of $5 billion by the end of 2009.  All other liabilities other than 

reverse repurchase agreements and reserve balances are assumed to be constant at 

their level as of July 31, 2009.  Federal Reserve Bank capital is projected to grow in 

line with its average pace of expansion over the past ten years.   

These projections for liabilities and capital, combined with the assumed path for 

assets, imply a path for reserve balances under each scenario.  In all three scenarios, 

the implied level of reserve balances rises rapidly until the end of 2009 and then 

increases at a more moderate rate during the first quarter of 2010.  In the baseline 

scenario and Alternative A, reserve balances decline through the end of the forecast 

period, while in Alternative C, a resumption of open market purchases is required in 

2016 to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion. 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 47 of 71



 

 

                                           
16 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably 
from historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 
percent of assets and the Federal Reserve did not hold any agency mortgage-backed 
securities.  By contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasuries are projected to account for 
only around 30 percent of total assets at the end of 2009 and rise to just 36 percent of total 
assets at the end of the projection period.  Even under Alternative A, Treasury securities 
account for only about one-third of assets at the end of 2009. 

17 The calculated growth rates of the monetary base presented in the table are based on an 
approximation for month-average values.  

Under all scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands rapidly over the 

course of 2009.  For the baseline scenario, the balance sheet reaches a peak of 

$2.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2010 and then declines to a level of $1.5 trillion at 

the end of the projection period.  For Alternative A, the peak occurs on the same 

date, but at a higher level of $2.8 trillion.  Assets then decline to roughly the same 

level as in the baseline scenario.  For Alternative C, the balance sheet peaks at $2.4 

trillion at the end of 2009, and assets decline to $1.4 trillion at the end of the 

projection period.16 

Projections for the growth rates of the monetary base are derived from these 

balance sheet projections as the growth rate of the sum of Federal Reserve notes in 

circulation and reserve balances.17  Under all scenarios, the monetary base expands in 

the second half of 2009 and into early 2010.  In the second half of 2010, however, as 

increases in asset holdings cease and the liquidity facilities wind down, the monetary 

base begins to contract; the base continues to decline through the remainder of the 

projection period despite continued growth in currency. 

Relative to the June Bluebook, there are a number of notable changes to the 

projections.  The starting point is different because the size of the balance sheet in 

July was lower than expected at the time of the last Bluebook, primarily because 

agency MBS purchases and settlements were smaller than forecasted, and the CPFF 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 48 of 71



 

 

wound down faster than expected.  For asset purchases in the baseline scenario, three 

changes affect the forecast: The rate of Treasury securities purchases was modified, 

and the completion date of the program was extended from September to October; 

agency debt purchases were reduced; and some agency MBS settlements were pushed 

from 2009 into 2010 in order to reflect expected settlement lags.  For liquidity and 

credit programs, the projection for TAF now includes an uptick in demand at the end 

of the year.  Also, TAF is assumed to become a permanent policy tool, remaining at a 

level of $20 billion through the end of the forecast period.  The TALF is assumed to 

extend a somewhat lower volume of loans than previously.  Some of the other lending 

facilities are now seen as running off slightly faster than was projected last round in 

light of the improvement in financial markets.  In contrast, the SDR certificate 

account was revised upward by $25 billion from about $2 billion reflecting the 

monetization of the assumed allocation of SDRs.  On balance, total assets at year-end 

2009 are about $240 billion lower in this projection compared with that presented in 

the June Bluebook, mostly a result of the change in assumptions about agency MBS 

settlement.  By the end of the projection period in 2016, however, total assets are a 

little above that in the June Bluebook projection, reflecting the permanent addition of 

the TAF and the monetization of the SDRs.   

On the liabilities side, the staff has made only modest changes to the projections 

relative to the June Bluebook.  The growth rate of currency was marked down 

somewhat in 2011, reflecting a reassessment of currency growth for the last year of 

our money projection period.  The Supplementary Financing Account is now 

assumed to stay at its current level of $200 billion somewhat longer, based on 

statements made by the Treasury in its last quarterly financing estimates.  The level of 

reserve balances is somewhat lower at the end of this year, primarily reflecting the 

shift in agency MBS settlement timing.  However, from mid-2010 forward, the 

increases in TAF outstanding and in the SDR certificate account balance, as well as a 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 49 of 71



 

 

  

lower projected level for currency, lead to a somewhat higher level of reserve 

balances.   

The extended Greenbook projection shows the target federal funds rate rising 

from the current 0 to ¼ percent range to 2.45 percent over the course of 2012.  

Under the operating procedures employed before the financial crisis, the projected 

level of reserve balances at the end of 2012 of approximately $850 billion would not 

have been consistent with a federal funds rate significantly above zero.  If the interest 

rate paid on excess reserve balances becomes an effective floor for the federal funds 

rate, a higher target rate could be achieved even with quite elevated reserve balances 

simply by raising the excess reserves rate.  The experience last autumn, however, may 

suggest that other tools may be needed to augment the rate paid on excess reserves to 

control the funds rate.  The projection for the balance sheet implicitly assumes that 

alternative operating procedures can be put into place to achieve the path for the 

federal funds rate assumed in the Greenbook projection; such procedures might 

employ a range of tools such as reverse repurchase agreements, outright sales of 

securities, a term deposit facility, or other strategies.  The balance sheet effects of 

these tools, however, are not included in these projections.

BANK CREDIT, DEBT, AND MONEY FORECAST 

The outlook for nonfederal debt growth and bank credit expansion is relatively 

weak, consistent with continued financial market strains and the staff’s forecast of a 

quite anemic economic recovery.  M2 is also likely to be weak as a result of slow 

income growth and a continued gradual reallocation of household wealth toward 

riskier assets. 

Bank credit is projected to decline at an average annual rate of about 2 percent 

over the second half of this year, reflecting persistent weakness in all major loan 

categories.  In 2010, as economic activity strengthens and lending standards gradually 

ease, growth of bank credit is forecasted to step up to around 3¾ percent, slightly 

lower than the rate of expansion in nominal income.  C&I loans are expected to 

follow the same general trajectory, contracting at an average annual rate of almost 

4 percent in the second half of 2009 and growing only about 1 percent in 2010.  Real 

estate loans on banks’ books, a category that includes loans secured by both 

commercial and residential real estate, are projected to run off through the end of 

2009, reflecting slowing refinancing activity and continued loan sales to the GSEs.  In 

addition, the continued deterioration in the credit quality of banks’ commercial real 

estate loan portfolios is projected to exert considerable drag on real estate lending, 

which is expected to remain very weak until the second half of 2010.  With weak 

demand and tight credit conditions, consumer loans are expected to contract about 

5¼ percent over the second half of this year and then grow about 2½ percent next 

year as consumer spending increases and unemployment levels off.  Growth in 

securities holdings is expected to be fairly strong through 2010 as banks continue to 

favor safe and liquid assets amid weak demand for loans and concerns about credit 

quality. 

August 6, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 55 of 71



 

 

 

  

Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand at an average annual 

rate of about 5 percent in the second half of this year, reflecting rapid growth of 

federal debt and a moderate rise in state and local government debt.  In contrast, 

private-sector debt is expected to remain nearly flat.  Staff projects that federal debt 

will continue to increase rapidly through the end of 2010 but that borrowing by 

households will continue to contract and debt growth of nonfinancial businesses will 

remain extremely light by historical standards.  Although the level of overall 

household debt is forecasted to begin to edge up next year as the economy improves, 

the rise will be limited by the elevated unemployment rate, continued deleveraging by 

households, and lending standards that ease only gradually.  Despite the expected 

further improvement in conditions in capital markets, borrowing by nonfinancial 

businesses will also likely remain sluggish through the end of the forecast period, in 

part because the low level of capital expenditures should limit the demand for external 

funds. 

M2 is projected to contract over the second half of this year as households 

continue to reallocate some of their wealth toward riskier assets.  The runoff in M2 is 

accounted for by declines in small time deposits and money market mutual funds 

amid very low interest rates on those instruments, as well as a slowing in the rate of 

growth of liquid deposits.  In 2010, M2 is forecast to increase less rapidly than 

nominal GDP, as improvements in economic and financial market conditions 

continue to reduce demand for M2 assets.

DIRECTIVE 

The June directive and draft language for the August directive are provided below. 

JUNE FOMC MEETING 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 

during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit 

markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should 

depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment 

of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that the combination 

of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of 

the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The 

Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt by the 

end of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS 

by the end of the year.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to $300 billion of 

longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the third quarter.  The System Open 

Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of 

ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the 

attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 

price stability.

Measure  Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation. 

APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL RATE 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS   
For the following rules

  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

Outcome-based rule it

Forecast-based rule it

Taylor (1993) rule it

Taylor (1999) rule it

First-difference rule it

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS   
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  

NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND 
MONETARY BASE  

This appendix presents more detail on the assumptions underlying the long-run projections of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the monetary base shown in the section entitled “Long-Run 
Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from August 2009 to December 2016.  The 
few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be constant over the projection 
period at the level for July 31, 2009.  The projections for all major asset and liability categories are 
summarized in the charts and table that follow the bullet points. 

ASSETS 

Asset Purchases 

• The baseline scenario incorporates only those asset purchases roughly in line with those that 
have been announced. 

o The Desk purchases a total of $300 billion of Treasury securities, $150 billion of 
agency debt, and $1.25 trillion of agency MBS. 

o Purchases of Treasury securities are expected to be completed by October 2009, and 
purchases of agency debt and agency MBS are to be completed by year-end 2009. 

o The maturity distribution of the Treasuries purchases is based on FRBNY Markets 
Group internal forecasts.  The maturities of most purchases are between two and ten 
years, with the weighted average maturity being a little over six years. 

o No sales are assumed, and maturing securities are not rolled over.  As a result, total 
holdings of Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Treasury securities 
previously held in the SOMA portfolio are assumed to be reinvested as they mature.  
Agency debt holdings peak at $150 billion in 2009, and decline slowly over the 
remainder of the forecast horizon.   

o Due to expected settlement lags and forecasts of dollar rolls and prepayments, 
agency MBS holdings peak at $1.24 trillion in March 2010, a slightly lower level than 
the amount purchased.  For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on rough 
estimates from the Desk.  The historically low coupon on these securities implies a 
relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a result, at the end of 2016, $785 billion of the 
$1.25 trillion of MBS purchased remains on the balance sheet. 

•  In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, purchases of Treasury securities are 
increased by $150 billion to $450 billion by the end of the year.  No other changes to the 
assumptions are made, and securities mature at the same rate as in the baseline scenario.   

• In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, purchases of agency MBS are decreased by 
$250 billion to $1.0 trillion by the end of the year.  No other changes to the assumptions are

1 On March 2, the Federal Reserve and Treasury jointly announced a restructuring of the government’s 

assistance to AIG.  As part of this restructuring, the revolving credit facility will be reduced in exchange for 
preferred interests in two SPVs created to hold all the common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.  It is 
assumed that the total size of the assistance to AIG is unaffected by this restructuring, and thus there is no 
impact on reserves and the monetary base. 

 

made, and securities mature at the same rate as in the baseline scenario.  However, by the 
end of the projection period, the expansion of currency and capital combined with a runoff 
of other assets necessitates the resumption of standard open market purchases to maintain 
reserve balances at a level of $25 billion.  It is assumed that the Desk purchases shorter-
dated Treasury securities to satisfy this need. 

Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 

• Primary credit is assumed to decline moderately from its current level to $1 billion by the 
end of 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero for 
the entire projection period. 

• Term Auction Facility (TAF) credit is assumed to increase temporarily in response to year-
end pressures at the end of 2009 before dropping down to reach a steady state level of 
$20 billion at the end of 2010, remaining there until the end of the projection period.   

• Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decline with improved market functioning and fall to 
zero a few months following the expiration date of the program on February 1, 2010.   

• Credit extended to and preferred stock interests in AIG wind down by the end of 2013.1  In 
addition, the assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III 
LLC are assumed to be sold over time and reach a nominal level by 2016.   

• The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), based partly on its slow initial 
uptake, is assumed to peak at $165 billion, well below the $1 trillion limit. 

o TALF loans with a three-year maturity reach $120 billion by the program’s assumed 
expiration date of March 31, 2010.  A portion of these loans are expected to prepay, 
and the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the end of 2012. 

o TALF loans with a five-year maturity reach $45 billion by the end of June 2010.  
These loans are assumed to be held to maturity, and the quantity outstanding reaches 
zero by the end of 2015. 

• Reflecting improvements in market conditions, the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money 
Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) is expected to wind down to zero by 
September 2009.  Credit extended through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) 
winds down to zero a few months after the facility expires on February 1, 2010.   

LIABILITIES 
• Currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows in line with the staff forecast for 

money stock currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the projection 
period, currency grows at the same rate as nominal GDP as projected in the extended 
Greenbook forecast.

• The U.S. Treasury’s general account returns to its historical target level of $5 billion by the 
end of 2009.  This account remains constant at that level over the forecast period. 

• The Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account is projected to wind down to zero by the 
third quarter of 2010, and remain at zero for the rest of the of the forecast period.  

• Reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official and international accounts are expected 
to decrease to $30 billion by the end of 2010 as these funds move to other investments.   

• Capital is expected to grow at 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 

• Reserve balances of depository institutions are assumed to be determined by the evolution of 
the assets and other liabilities of the Federal Reserve.  As the asset side of the balance sheet 
contracts, so do reserve balances.  Over the projection period, reserve balances in the 
baseline scenario are expected to fall to $91 billion.
