STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

DECEMBER5, 2002

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

BYTHE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



1 The federal funds rate averaged close to 1-1/4 percent over the intermeeting
period.  To counteract reserve drains from the year-end increase in currency, the Desk
expanded outstanding long-term RPs from $6 billion to $18 billion.  The Desk also
purchased $653 million of Treasury coupon issues in the market and $250 million of
Treasury bills from foreign central banks.

Strictly Confidential (F.R.) December 5, 2002
Class II – FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Market participants had expected that the FOMC would cut its target for

the federal funds rate 25 basis points at the November meeting and retain a balance of

risks toward weakness, and then ease policy again early next year.  Consequently, they

were caught off guard by the immediate 50 basis point cut and the shift to an

assessment of balanced risks.  Treasury coupon yields initially fell following the

announcement but rebounded later that afternoon, as investors focused on the shift

to balance and lowered the odds on pronounced economic weakness, in part

reflecting the policy action.  Over most of the intermeeting period, incoming

economic data and earnings news further reassured market participants about the

outlook.  In recent days, however, markets absorbed more mixed economic reports

and downbeat information on prospects in the tech sector.  Still, interest-rate futures

suggest that investors continue to expect monetary policy tightening to commence

next year and, indeed, now anticipate a higher path for the federal funds rate after

midyear than they did before the last meeting (chart 1).  Options on those futures

indicate less near-term uncertainty about the path for rates and, in particular, little

likelihood of outcomes requiring very low funds rates next spring (see the box on

page 2).  Futures quotes and survey results suggest that market participants put slim

odds on a policy easing at the December meeting.1

The FOMC’s decision to lowerthe target rate to1-1/4 percent at its November
meeting and theprevailing conditions of low inflationand sluggish globaleconomic
growthhavespurred discussion in thepressand in marketsabout the possibility that
U.S. monetarypolicy could be constrained by thezero bound onnominal interest
rates. Most recently, however, investors apparentlyhaveput lowodds onsuch an
outcome. Thedashed and solid lines in the left-hand panelbelow depict the
estimated probabilities embedded in the prices of optionson interest-rate futures that
the target fundsratewill moveto or below100 basis points and 50 basis points,
respectively, over thenext five months. Those probabilities rose in early October
amid thedowndraft in equitypricesand jumped again late that month following news
reports suggesting that theFOMCwaspreparing to easepolicyat its November
meeting. Since then,however, theprobability of a rateat or below50 basispointshas
fallen toquite low levelsas investors’ fearsabout downside risks for the economy
seemto have diminished. Such reduced concerns also seemto be evident in equity
index options. As noted in the bottomright panel, the probability that investors
attach to a significant drop in equitypriceshas fallen overthe past twomonths but
remains elevated.

(2) Reflecting the upward shift in the expected path for the target federal

funds rate after the middle of next year, yields on two-year Treasury notes climbed

about 15 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Yields on ten-year nominal and

inflation-indexed Treasuries both were about unchanged on balance, suggesting that

long-term inflation expectations were stable.  The improved outlook for the economy

and earnings initially buoyed stock prices, but equity markets sold off over the past

few days in response to the mixed readings on the economy and signs of a less

buoyant path for earnings than previously expected.  On balance, broad stock price

indexes edged down ½ to 1 percent, while the Nasdaq was up about ½ percent,

implying that earnings-price ratios remained fairly high relative to real interest rates. 

Expected stock market volatility implied by options prices was about unchanged on

net.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade issues over Treasuries declined 10 to 40

basis points, while those on speculative-grade bonds dropped more than 100 basis

points (chart 2).  Nonetheless, credit spreads stayed wide, probably reflecting concerns

that default rates could remain high and recovery rates low for some time.  Overall

market conditions generally improved in the weeks prior to the November FOMC

meeting and have improved somewhat further over the intermeeting period, helping

to keep year-end pressures subdued thus far (see the box on page 4). 

(3) The dollar’s value against major foreign currencies strengthened about

3/4 percent on a trade-weighted basis over the intermeeting period.  In the euro area,

signs of increasing economic weakness prompted the European Central Bank to lower

policy rates 50 basis points today, somewhat more than had been built into market

prices.  For the period as a whole, yields on long-term government debt in the Euro

area fell 10 to 15 basis points, stock price indexes declined a little, and the euro’s value

against the dollar was about unchanged.  Financial markets in Japan fluctuated mainly

in response to speculation about fiscal policy measures and banking sector reforms.

Year-end Pressures and Credit Market Conditions

As shown in thebottom-left panel, term funding pressuresover year-end in the
commercialpapermarket havebeen rather muted todate. Thesharp contraction
over thepast year in paper outstanding and theexit of riskier credits fromthemarket
havereportedly damped year-end premiums. In the interbank market,many
institutionsare experiencing strong coredeposit growthand thusmay feel little
pressure to secure term funding over the turnof theyear. Moreover, futuresmarket
quotes suggest that market participants anticipate that the Systemwill againbe quite
generous in theprovisionof reservesat year-end,with the implied fundsrateexpected
at year-end at least 50 basis pointsbelow the target.

The recent improvement in credit market conditionsmore broadlyhas
probably also been a factor tending to damp year-end pressures by reducing concerns
that intermediationcould be impaired and that lower-rated borrowers might not be
able to obtain funding overthe turn. Spreads on credit default swapsof major
intermediaries (shownat theright) and on the subordinated debt of large banks have
continued to shrink overthe period. Anecdotal informationcollected by theDesk
suggests that liquidityconditions are about normalin theTreasurymarket and have
improved considerably in the investment-grade corporate bond market. Liquidity in
the junkbond market reportedly remainssub-par,but some market participantshave
noted an improved tone of late accompanying the sizable inflows to junk bond mutual
funds.

     .  The Desk did not intervene for the accounts of the

System or the Treasury.

The announcement of reforms in late November omitted some key details, but

market participants judged that the full plan will be inadequate to the task.  After the

announcement, bank stock prices staged a modest recovery but finished well down on

the period.  Broad indexes of Japanese share prices were off only slightly.  The Bank

of Japan indicated that it now would aim at the upper end of its target range for

reserve balances and began to implement its previously announced plan to purchase

equities from banks.  On net, the dollar gained about 2-1/2 percent versus the yen,

with a sizable move late in the period following comments by Japanese officials that

seemed to favor yen weakness.  Against an index of the currencies of our other

important trading partners, the dollar moved up a touch over the period.  Early in the

period, pro-market statements by associates of the Brazilian president-elect

contributed to a substantial narrowing of that country’s EMBI+ spread, but that move

was retraced partially as markets became jittery about the staffing of key economic

posts; although stocks rose about 6 percent, the real declined 5-1/2 percent against the

dollar.2

(4) With the U.S. corporate bond market more receptive, gross bond

issuance by nonfinancial firms in November recovered to the fastest pace since June. 

In markets for shorter-term business credit, both commercial paper and bank loans

were about unchanged last month after sharp declines over most of the year.  The

sum of outstanding bonds, paper, and business loans appears to be increasing this

quarter after the first quarterly declines ever recorded for this series in the previous

two quarters.  Investor appetite for riskier corporate securities apparently has

increased, with both equity and junk bond mutual funds experiencing inflows in

November following outflows in several recent months.  In the household sector,

indexes of mortgage applications suggest that households have continued to take on

mortgage debt at a rapid clip.  Growth in consumer credit slowed further in October

from its modest third-quarter pace, likely held down by paydowns of consumer debt

with the proceeds of cash-out mortgage refinancing.

(5) M2 posted an 8-3/4 percent annual growth rate in November following

a 10-1/4 percent increase in October, with the advance again concentrated in liquid

deposits.  The demand for liquid assets continued to be lifted by the low level of their

opportunity costs and heavy mortgage refinancing.  Over the four quarters of 2002,

M2 is estimated to have expanded about 7 percent after rising 10-1/4 percent in 2001. 

Growth in M2 has again outstripped that of nominal GDP, which is expected to

expand 4-1/4 percent, but by less than in 2001.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt

likely will rise 6-3/4 percent in 2002, a bit faster than in 2001, but its nonfederal

component is expected to decelerate about a percentage point to 6-1/2 percent.  The

appendix contains a more detailed discussion of developments in money and credit

over the year.



7

Policy Alternatives

(6) The FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy at the November

meeting, some improvement in financial market conditions on balance, and an

assessment that fiscal policy could be somewhat more expansionary have led the staff

to boost its projection of economic activity over the next two years.  The assumed

funds rate target is now 50 basis points lower than in the previous projection and

remains at that level until mid-2004, when the FOMC begins tightening.  Treasury

bond and mortgage rates are roughly flat over the forecast period, while investment-

grade corporate yields move down considerably as risk premiums fall further in an

environment of strengthening growth.  Equity prices rise at about the same pace as in

the last Greenbook, but from an upwardly revised base.  The exchange value of the

dollar, as before, is seen as edging down in this forecast.  Real GDP growth, projected

at 3-1/4 percent next year and 4-1/4 percent in 2004, is up a little more than 1/4

percentage point from the last Greenbook.  The forecast for unemployment has been

revised down correspondingly, with the rate now seen as declining from a high of 6

percent in the first three quarters of next year to just below 5-1/2 percent by the end

of the forecast period, still above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU.  As a

consequence of the lessened slack in resource use, prices are predicted to decelerate a

shade less than in the previous projection, with core PCE inflation expected to drift

down to a 1-1/4 percent rate in 2004. 

(7) Should the Committee share the staff’s assessment of the underlying

forces shaping the economy and be of the view that the monetary stimulus in the

pipeline is adequate to support satisfactory economic growth with low inflation, it may

want to stand pat at this meeting on both the funds rate target and the risk

assessment.  Standard relationships suggest that, given the lags in the effects of

monetary policy, last year’s easings are still supporting growth in aggregate demand,



8

and November’s action, which moved the real federal funds rate more distinctly into

negative territory, created a larger gap below the band of estimated equilibrium real

rates (chart 3).  In view of the stimulus that is already in place, the Committee may

wish to await the arrival of more information, possibly including the economic

implications of any military conflict, before adjusting its policy stance.  The

Committee may believe that, given the current stance of policy, the low odds but high

costs of marked further disinflation (or even outright deflation) and the economic

weakness that presumably would attend such a development roughly balance the

arguably higher odds but lower costs of increased inflation and an unsustainable pace

of growth.  Thus, the Committee may believe that retaining the current degree of

policy accommodation would be consistent with an assessment of balanced risks. 

(8) If the Committee sees a need for additional insurance against excessive

disinflation and economic weakness, it may want to implement a further 25 basis

point reduction in its funds rate target at this meeting while maintaining an

assessment of balanced risks.  The available evidence suggests only a small increase in

real GDP this quarter, and the recovery in GDP growth from the current “soft spot”

is still largely a forecast, so that a much weaker outcome cannot be ruled out.  Some

combination of anemic real growth and a more favorable inflation-output tradeoff

could cause the inflation rate over the next couple of years to run noticeably below the

staff projection, potentially constraining the Committee’s ability to lower real interest

rates if the need were to arise.  Even abstracting from uncertainties, the Committee

might concur with the Greenbook’s revised projections for output and resource use

under the policy assumption of that forecast but still regard them to be unacceptably

weak and to warrant further stimulus, as in the policymaker perfect foresight

simulations portrayed in chart 4.  Should the further policy easing eventually prove to

have been unnecessary, the likely persistence of some economic slack for at least the

The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) through 2008:
      ●      potential output grows at about 3-1/2 percent per year
      ●      the relative price of oil stabilizes at its end of 2004 level
      ●      the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
      ●      federal budget deficit relative to GDP declines gradually

rate as a proxy for inflation expectations.

next several quarters suggests that the move could probably be reversed before any

damage was done to the Committee’s longer-run inflation objectives.

(9) Given that market participants see little chance of a shift in either the

funds rate target or the assessment of risks at this meeting, a choice that matches this

expectation should not have any appreciable effect on market prices.  An easing of 25

basis points, however, would surprise investors, and the resulting fall in short-term

interest rates could carry over in part to bond yields.  Stock prices could rise as

prospective earnings are discounted at lower interest rates and, perhaps, as investors

revise up their outlook for earnings.  The value of the dollar might move lower in line

with the reduction in fixed-income yields.  However, if equity markets rally strongly,

these effects on bond yields and the dollar could well be reversed. 

(10) Under the Greenbook forecast and its assumption of an unchanged

policy stance though mid-2004, the projected growth of M2 from November through

March, at 7 percent, would be a bit slower than in recent months.  An ebbing of

mortgage refinancing and renewed attractiveness of investment in the stock market

should damp the expansion of liquid accounts.  Reduced home mortgage growth is

projected to cause a falloff in overall borrowing by households in coming months. 

Consumer credit growth should remain moderate, as the effects of a slowdown in

spending on durables are roughly offset by smaller paydowns of consumer loans from

cash-out mortgage refinancing.  For businesses, the staff anticipates a small upturn in

borrowing, reflecting a wider gap between capital spending and internal funds and

some revival of merger activity.  Corporate bond issuance, in particular, is likely to

show some vigor, as investors’ risk aversion diminishes further, while bank loans and

commercial paper stay about flat.  Nonfederal debt is projected to expand at a 6

percent rate in the first quarter, down a little from this year’s pace.  With federal debt

growth likely to remain near this year’s rate, overall domestic nonfinancial sector debt

growth is projected to edge down 1/2 percentage point from this year’s pace to 6-1/4

percent in the first quarter.

Appendix
Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2002

Declines in long-term interest rates, which brought yields to forty-year lows,
importantly shaped private credit flows this year.  In the business sector, low interest rates on
corporate bonds helped sustain a brisk pace of gross bond issuance through mid-year,
although the proceeds were largely used to refinance existing debt.  Subsequently, mixed
readings on the strength of the economic expansion, reports of deficiencies in corporate
governance, a worsening of corporate credit quality, and heightened geopolitical risks pushed
risk spreads sharply higher and brought issuance to a virtual halt.  For the year as a whole,
overall business borrowing was quite weak, mainly owing to sagging capital expenditures, an
evaporation of merger and acquisition activity, and an increased reliance on liquid assets that
had been built up previously. 

Household borrowing, by contrast, remained robust in 2002.  Credit flows in the
residential mortgage market picked up from an already brisk pace as borrowers took
advantage of low mortgage interest rates, and as strong motor vehicle sales boosted the
expansion of consumer credit.  Against the backdrop of weak tax receipts and increased
outlays, the federal government tapped markets in heavy volume for the first time in several
years.  Meanwhile, greater safe-haven demand for liquid assets that likely reflected investors’
disenchantment with the stock market supported the broad monetary aggregates this year,
although their expansion slowed, owing to the waning effects of the substantial monetary
policy easing of 2001.

Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt

The aggregate debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded 6¾ percent in 2002, a
bit faster than in 2001.  Spurred by weak tax receipts and an acceleration in spending, federal
debt grew 7½ percent this year after contracting slightly in 2001.  The growth of nonfederal
debt, by contrast, slowed to a 6½ percent pace in 2002 from 7½ percent last year, owing for
the most part to a sharp slowdown in business borrowing.
   

Anemic business borrowing this year was largely attributable to weak demand for
credit, reflecting depressed capital expenditures and modest increases in internal funds, as
well as the tendency of some firms to draw on liquid assets—which began the year at high
levels—rather than to seek external financing.  Over the first half of the year, gross issuance
of corporate bonds by nonfinancial corporations moderated somewhat from the rapid clip
set in 2001, but still remained brisk.  Firms used the proceeds to refinance higher-cost
long-term debt at more attractive interest rates and to strengthen their balance sheets by
paying down short-term obligations such as bank loans and commercial paper.  Issuance of
bonds by higher-rated speculative-grade firms outside the beleaguered telecom and energy
sectors also held up reasonably well in the first half.



A-2

Both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond issuance, however, slowed
dramatically in the second half of 2002, as investors’ demand for corporate debt weakened
because of concerns about the reliability of financial statements and the quality of corporate
governance, deteriorating credit worthiness, and historically low recovery rates on defaulted
bonds in some sectors.  Worries about the possibility of additional earnings restatements
diminished after the SEC’s August 14 deadline for certification of financial statements passed
without any significant new revelations of corporate chicanery.  However, with a weaker tone
of economic data and heightened geopolitical risks early in the fall, spreads of lower-tier
investment-grade and high-yield issues over Treasuries climbed to their highest levels in
more than a decade, evidently reflecting both greater expected losses and some pullback
from risk-taking.  Trading conditions in the corporate bond market also deteriorated
somewhat during this period, with debt issued by auto manufacturers and their finance
subsidiaries especially hard hit at times.  As the fall progressed, however, more upbeat news
about the economy sparked a rally in equity prices and renewed investors’ appetite for
corporate debt, pushing risk spreads sharply lower and leading to a rebound in bond
issuance.

In the commercial paper market, companies perceived as having questionable
accounting practices experienced significant investor resistance and most discontinued their
programs, while others shifted to alternative forms of finance in an effort to strengthen their
balance sheets.  In addition, commercial banks reported that they tightened standards and
terms on commercial paper backup lines of credit, citing heightened concerns about possible
deterioration in the credit quality of issuers and a higher probability of lines being drawn
upon because of potential strains in the commercial paper market.  All told, nonfinancial
commercial paper outstanding declined 39 percent in 2002, after dropping almost a third the
previous year.

The runoff of business loans at commercial banks that started early last year
intensified in 2002.  Large banks reported a further weakening of demand for C&I loans
over the course of the year, mainly owing to reduced outlays on capital equipment and
inventories and moribund merger activity.  These institutions attributed the striking decline
in C&I loans not only to the reduced funding needs of creditworthy borrowers that found
bond financing or a runoff of liquid assets more attractive, but also to a reduction in the pool
of creditworthy borrowers that stemmed from a deterioration in asset quality and a
tightening of banks’ lending policies over the course of the year.  A significant net percentage
of banks pointed to the possibility of further revelations of accounting problems as a reason
for tightening their lending policies during the first half of the year.  However, the
proportions of banks that tightened lending standards and terms on C&I loans declined
noticeably in 2002.
 

After having surged late in 2001, growth in commercial mortgage debt dropped
sharply during the first quarter of 2002, as nonresidential construction spending fell.  Despite



A-3

the continued contraction in outlays on nonresidential structures, commercial mortgage debt
expanded briskly over the remainder of 2002, reflecting in part substitution for other
corporate debt and supporting a robust issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities. 
Although vacancy rates moved somewhat higher, delinquency rates on commercial
mortgages remained at historically low levels, and banks firmed standards on commercial real
estate loans in 2002, on net.

Expansion of overall household debt picked up in 2002 to the fastest pace since 1989. 
With mortgage rates at very low levels by historical standards, new purchases of homes and
mortgage refinancing activity were elevated throughout the year, spurring a rapid 11½
percent advance in home mortgage debt.  Reportedly, a significant number of households
that refinanced home mortgages took the opportunity to extract equity to repay other debt as
well as to finance home improvements and other expenditures.  Still, consumer credit
expanded at a 4¼ percent pace in 2002, supported in part by the automakers’ cut-rate
financing incentives and generous rebates.  Hefty growth of overall household debt offset
declines in the cost of debt, on net, to keep the household debt-service burden near its mid-
1980s peak over the year.

Despite the elevated debt-service burden, household balance sheets stayed in
relatively good repair.  Although the rate of personal bankruptcy fillings has risen, on net,
this year and delinquency rates remain high for subprime borrowers, broad measures of
delinquencies on home mortgages and consumer loans have edged down.  The ratio of
household assets to disposable income fell this year, as steep losses in equity markets
outweighed solid gains in house prices and disposable income rose.  Households continued
net purchases of equity mutual funds through the spring, despite the falling and volatile stock
market.  Further net declines in equity prices since then, however, led to enormous
withdrawals from equity mutual funds, which evidently were partly redirected toward
government bond funds.

State and local government debt accelerated this year from the already brisk pace of
2001.  Strong issuance of long-term municipal debt for new capital projects and advance
refunding was bolstered by an appreciable decline in yields on both revenue and general
obligation bonds.  Fiscal difficulties in many states meant that short-term issuance also was
well maintained.  Credit quality in the municipal sector worsened somewhat in the second
half of 2002, with the ratio of long-term municipal bond yields to Treasury yields rising
significantly late in the year, reflecting deteriorating fiscal positions and the heavy pace of
municipal issuance.

After it resumed net borrowing in the second half of 2001, the Treasury continued to
tap markets in volume this year.  Federal debt grew at an 8½ percent pace in the first half of
the year, fueled by a significant weakening of tax receipts owing to reduced tax rates and
sluggish income growth, the paucity of taxable capital gains, as well as increased outlays for



A-4

defense and homeland security.  In the spring, the Treasury had to resort to emergency
accounting devices to create financing room within the existing $5.95 trillion statutory debt
limit, which the Congress raised to $6.4 trillion on June 27.  Federal borrowing remained at a
brisk 6½ percent pace over the second half of 2002.      

Depository Credit

The expansion of depository credit moderated in 2002.  Credit at thrift institutions
decelerated somewhat from last year’s pace, though the slowdown can be attributed for the
most part to a large thrift institution’s conversion to a bank charter.  The growth of bank
credit picked up significantly from the anemic pace in 2001, driven by a robust acquisition of
securities, especially mortgage-backed securities, as well as a surge in home equity and
residential real estate loans.  Business loans at commercial banks, by contrast, continued to
run off.  The pricing of new business loans indicated that banks remain particularly
concerned about lower-quality borrowers, consistent with the selectivity observed in the
bond and syndicated loan markets.  In lending to households, moderate net percentages of
domestic banks also tightened credit conditions for credit card and other consumer loans in
2002.  The proportion of domestic banks that tightened credit standards on residential
mortgage loans rose late in the year to the highest share in the past decade, but nonetheless
remained quite low.

Commercial banks registered strong profit gains this year, reflecting robust fee
income from mortgage and credit card lending, more stringent cost controls, as well as the
relatively less expensive funding offered by inflows of core deposits.  Loss provisioning and
nonperforming loans increased overall, although banks generally remained very well
capitalized.          

Monetary Aggregates

M2 grew 7 percent this year, considerably below the 10¼ percent rate of increase in
2001.  The growth of M2 dropped in the first half of 2002, owing to a sharp slowdown in its
liquid components, as the opportunity cost of holding M2 leveled out, because deposit rates
caught up with the earlier fall in market interest rates.  M2 accelerated significantly in the
second half, as households, apparently in response to falling and volatile equity prices,
moved large sums from domestic equity mutual funds.  M2 growth was also supported by
another wave of mortgage refinancing activity, as mortgage interest rates fell to new lows. 
With the expansion of M2 continuing to outrun that of nominal income, M2 velocity
declined for the fifth year in a row.
