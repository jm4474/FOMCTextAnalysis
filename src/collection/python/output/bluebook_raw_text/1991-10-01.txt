MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC September 27, 1991

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In the weeks immediately after the August FOMC meeting,

the Desk sought to maintain existing reserve pressures, basing reserve

targets initially on an allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrow-

ing of $375 million and expecting federal funds to continue to trade

around 5-1/2 percent. Through September 12, the federal funds rate

averaged around that level, while the borrowing allowance was reduced

to $300 million in two technical adjustments, reflecting an abatement

of seasonal borrowing needs. On September 13, the Board lowered the

discount rate to 5 percent in response to weakness in the monetary and

credit aggregates, the improving inflation environment, and concerns

about the strength of the economic expansion. Accompanying that

action, the federal funds rate was expected to decline to around 5-1/4

percent, with the borrowing allowance increased to $325 million to

reflect the partial pass-through of the discount rate cut. Through

the first eight days of the current maintenance period, federal funds

have averaged 5.31 percent, and borrowing $341 million.1

(2) Market interest rates rose slightly in the days after

the August meeting, reflecting both the absence of an immediate policy

easing and the strong durable goods report. Rates declined in

subsequent weeks, however, as incoming nonfinancial and monetary

1. In the two complete maintenance periods since the August
meeting, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged about $360
million, including $46 million of special situation borrowing.

2. Treasury bill rates rose substantially over these days as the
flight to quality and liquidity prompted by the coup attempt in the
Soviet Union unwound.



indicators were seen as increasing the likelihood of a sluggish expan-

sion, damped inflation, and an early move toward an easing of policy.

With data seen as still somewhat on the soft side, rates have con-

tinued to drift lower since the mid-September easing. On balance over

the intermeeting period, private short-term market rates are down 10

to 20 basis points, and intermediate- and long-term rates are off

about 1/4 percentage point. The prime rate was reduced by 1/2

percentage point to 8 percent subsequent to the policy action, but it

remains high relative to the cost of bank funding. The average com-

mitment rate on fixed-rate mortgages fell to 8.92 percent, its lowest

level since 1977, stimulating substantial refinancing activity.

Broader stock price indexes reached record levels shortly after the

meeting, but then lost part of their gains, finishing with increases

of 2 to 4 percent over the intermeeting period.

(3) The dollar declined against all major currencies, par-

ticularly the German mark and other EMS currencies, over the inter-

meeting period. On a weighted average basis, the dollar's deprecia-

tion was 5-3/4 percent. Of that, about half was a reversal very early

in the period of a spike occasioned by the attempted Soviet coup. The

subsequent course of Soviet events seemed to lessen further the risk

attached to mark assets. Relative monetary policy stances and pros-

pects also served to depress the dollar against the mark. German

interest rates held fairly steady, and market participants anticipated

no near-term change in the Bundesbank's monetary policy stance. In

3. Private three-month rates very recently become an exception to
this generalization, when they increased appreciably as their
maturity date moved past year-end; these rates are now little changed
on balance over the period. All financial market quotes in the
bluebook reflect data through noon, September 27.



Japan, indications of further slowing in economic growth and reserve

market operations by the Bank of Japan led to significant declines in

market interest rates and expectations of a further easing of monetary

policy. Still, the dollar has fallen 2-1/4 percent against the yen

since after the collapse of the coup, reflecting to some extent

increased market focus on Japan's burgeoning external surplus.

(4) The broad monetary aggregates have more or less levelled

out after sizable declines earlier in the summer. M2 is estimated to

have risen only slightly over August and September, and M3 to have

fallen at a 1 percent average rate. Both aggregates were somewhat

weaker than anticipated at the last FOMC meeting, leaving them around

the lower bounds of their respective annual ranges in September.4

By contrast. M1 grew at a 7 percent pace over August and September--in

line with its growth earlier in the year. On average for the

third quarter, M2 fell at a 1/4 percent annual pace and M3 at a 2-1/2

percent rate. To an extent, weak money reflects the relatively

slow expansion of nominal GNP, which is now estimated at 4-1/2 percent

in the third quarter, only a little above its pace in the second

4. Estimates of monetary growth in September are based on actual
data through the first two weeks of the month and preliminary data
for the third week.

5. Like the broader aggregates, M1 did accelerate noticeably from
a weak performance in July, lifting the growth of both required and
total reserves to a 9 percent rate over August and September. Non-
borrowed reserves rebounded to an average 11-3/4 percent pace over
the two months, as adjustment plus seasonal borrowing declined.
Aided by stronger currency growth, the monetary base is estimated to
have grown at a 7-1/2 percent rate over August and September.

6. This quarterly decline in M2 is the first since the official
series began in 1959 and nearly 2 percentage points below the
previous weakest quarter. The decline in M3 is only the second in
its official series.



quarter. But even given GNP, the behavior of M2 has been extraordi-

nary, as suggested by the nearly 5 percent rate of increase in its

velocity during the third quarter, in the face of the substantial

declines over previous quarters in the usual measure of opportunity

costs. The error for M2 growth in the staff money demand model

amounted to an unprecedented 6-1/4 percentage points for the quarter.

(5) The unusual weakness in M2 growth relative to that of

income in recent months reflects a variety of factors, many of them

difficult to quantify. Household portfolio shifts into higher-

yielding capital market instruments have been spurred by the lowest

yields on M2 assets in many years and a steeply upward-sloped yield

curve. Heightened demand for longer-term securities is indicated by

heavy flows into bond and equity mutual funds and an appreciable

increase in noncompetitive tenders for Treasury notes. In addition,

households may be using M2 assets to pay down debt and to finance

consumption, given the relatively high effective rates on consumer

credit and many existing mortgages. Low net returns on M2 assets have

resulted in part from declines in market rates, and also from unag-

gressive pursuit of deposits by banks and thrifts. Continued contrac-

tion of the thrift industry, along with weak bank credit, imply re-

duced demands for funding by depositories. While these developments

are primarily reflected in declines in large time deposits, they like-

ly have effects on the growth of M2 as well, through reduced advertis-

ing for retail deposits, higher service fees, a cutback in brokered

deposits at many institutions, and increased availability of alterna-

tive investments through bank offices. A portion of the shrinkage of

thrifts has resulted from stepped-up RTC activity, involving abrogated

contracts and disrupted thrift-depositor relationships. These iden-

tified shifts in household and depository behavior do not seem to

account for the entire shortfall in money growth, and they do not



themselves indicate whether this shortfall has implications for future

income. No doubt some portion of the shortfall reflects a reshuffling

of portfolios without clear implications for spending. However, the

behavior of M2 also may reflect weak prospective loan growth at

depositories, high real interest rates on longer-term instruments, or

low spending plans.

(6) Borrowing by nonfederal sectors appears to have remained

anemic in recent months, below the estimated growth of income, consis-

tent with the notion that credit supplies are still constrained and

spending is being supported in part by drawdowns of financial assets.

Consumer credit continued to decline in July and commercial bank data

suggest no growth in August and September. Bank real estate loans

fell over August and September; however, some of this decline undoub-

tedly is in commercial mortgages, and estimates of aggregate residen-

tial mortgage activity for the third quarter indicate that growth is

continuing at about the subdued second-quarter pace. Business borrow-

ing remains quite weak, likely reflecting continued sizable reductions

in inventories and reduced merger activity. Businesses continued to

raise substantial amounts in bond and equity markets, partly to fund

short-term debt. Supported by heavier borrowing by the federal

government, domestic nonfinancial debt growth appears to have picked

up to a pace of more than 5-1/2 percent in August, lifting the debt

aggregate to the lower end of its monitoring range.

incorporate adjustments for discontinuities associated with
changes in reserve requirements.



Policy Alternatives

(7) Two short-run policy alternatives are presented below

for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, the federal funds

rate would be expected to remain centered on 5-1/4 percent, in as-

sociation with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing of $325 million.7  Under alternative A, federal funds

would tend to trade around 4-3/4 percent, which could be fostered

either by lowering the borrowing specification by $50 million to $275

million or by lowering the discount rate by a further 1/2 point to

4-1/2 percent. The latter approach to alternative A would preserve

the present spread of the funds rate over the discount rate and thus

the current degree of cushioning of transitory shocks to the supply

and demand for reserves.

(8) Market participants in recent days appear to have built

in some prospects for additional easing of monetary policy in the

period ahead. Nonetheless, the unchanged federal funds rate associ-

ated with alternative B is unlikely to engender a marked backup in

yields in financial markets over the intermeeting period, so long as

incoming nonfinancial and monetary data are mixed, as would be the

case under the staff's forecast. Under those circumstances, the re-

cently lower exchange value of the dollar, too, probably will be

sustained. With elevated federal borrowing needs over the intermeet-

ing period continuing to place upward pressure on Treasury yields,

rate spreads on private instruments over Treasury securities also

would be anticipated to stay relatively narrow.

7. Over the intermeeting period, seasonal borrowing would be
expected to diminish, necessitating downward technical adjustments to
the borrowing specification.



(9) The size and timing of the 1/2 percentage point drop in

the federal funds rate of alternative A would tend to catch financial

markets unawares, inducing almost as large a drop in other short-term

interest rates. In the context of weak money growth, such an easing

might be seen as signifying Federal Reserve concern that financial

conditions, including credit availability, were not consistent with a

moderate expansion of the economy. In these circumstances, long-term

rates would be likely to drop, at least initially, in normal propor-

tion to the decline in short-term rates. Should subsequent data

suggest, however, that the recovery is already on track and inflation

progress only moderate, long-term rates might back up a bit, as the

lower level of short-term rates appeared unsustainable. The value of

the dollar on exchange markets would ratchet lower in response to the

downward movement of interest rates in the United States relative to

those abroad.

(10) The sizable overpredictions of M2 and M3 growth over

recent months have heightened the uncertainty surrounding the staff's

projections of money growth. This experience has reinforced the

suspicion that the relationships are changing or that there are

factors affecting M2 demand--such as promotional activity for retail

deposits and opportunity costs with respect to long-term rates or tax-

adjusted consumer credit rates--that have not previously been given

sufficient weight. However, assessing the magnitude of their effects

is extremely difficult given the limited period of anomalous M2

behavior.

(11) In making its projections, the staff has assumed that

the effects of some of these special factors will lessen a little in

coming months, so that somewhat faster growth in the broad aggregates

will resume. In particular, the stock adjustment to the current con-

stellation of various opportunity costs is seen as likely to abate



gradually, since holders of very liquid assets have already had ample

opportunity and incentive to shift portfolio holdings. In addition,

in light of the lengthening economic recovery and more certain income

prospects, money holders may be more willing to take on debt and thus

to resist a further steep decline in their real balances. On the

deposit-supply side, some recovery in bank credit seems in store for

coming months, which should show through to a more buoyant M2 as well

as M3. Finally, a little impetus to M2 in the fourth quarter is

likely to be provided by a pickup in growth in nominal GNP and spend-

ing. The staff's expectations for growth of the monetary aggregates

under the two policy alternatives are given in the table below, both

from September to December and from the fourth quarter of 1990 to

December. (The table and charts on the following pages contain more

detailed data.)

growth is projected to pick up to a 3 percent rate over the last three

months of the year, leaving this aggregate at the lower bound of its

long-run range. M1 is expected to grow at a 6-1/2 percent pace

from September to December, producing a similar growth rate on a

quarterly average basis and another decline in M1 velocity in reflec-

tion of the recent drop in its opportunity costs.9  On a quarterly

average basis, a 2-1/4 percent rate of M2 growth would be implied for

the year's final quarter, up from the slight decline posted in the

third quarter. The gain in the velocity of M2 in the fourth quarter--

given the staff's projection of 6 percent growth for nominal GNP--

would be somewhat below the estimated 4-1/2 percent annual rate of

increase in V2 estimated for the third quarter. The implied 3-1/2

percentage point error in the staff's standard econometric model for

M2 growth would be about half the size of the record miss of the third

quarter.

(13) Under alternative B, growth in M3 from September to

December is expected to strengthen to a 1-1/2 percent annual rate.

The runoff of commercial bank loans posted over the third quarter is

forecast to cease over the fourth quarter. With the strengthening of

bank capital positions progressing, and the default risk on some loan

applicants tempered by improving income prospects, bank lending terms

and conditions should remain stable and perhaps even start to ease a

8. We have made no allowance for unusual runoffs of time deposits
in October, when, according to news stories, there will be a bulge in
maturing retail CDs. The staff has no data to assess whether such a
bulge will indeed occur. Seasonally adjusted time deposits have not
exhibited unusual volatility in past Octobers relative to the ad-
jacent months, nor did they last April when another bulge was said to
be in train and time deposit rates had already decreased substan-
tially.

9. Total reserves are projected to grow at an 8 percent annual
rate from September to December. Combined with a 7 percent growth of
currency, the monetary base is anticipated to expand at a 7 percent
annual rate.

little. Bank funding needs would be bolstered, cutting into the

paydown of their managed liabilities. The contraction of thrift

balance sheets, however, is likely to continue unabated in the fourth

quarter, in association with sustained heavy RTC activity, assuming

congressional appropriation of requested funding. Large time deposits

would still run off, albeit at a slower pace than over recent months,

and M3 expansion would continue to be lower than growth of M2.

(14) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors under alter-

native B is projected to grow at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate from

August to December, somewhat faster than the pace now estimated over

July and August. The implied growth from the fourth quarter of 1990

of 5-1/4 percent to December would move this aggregate further into

its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent annual monitoring range. With the pickup

in GNP expansion, nonfederal debt growth is projected to rise to

around a 4 percent rate over the last four months of this year. The

strengthening is expected in a number of components, though growth

continues to be relatively sluggish, reflecting persisting credit

supply restraint and high spreads of lending over borrowing rates at

intermediaries. In the household sector, home mortgage debt growth

strengthens a little through year-end in the forecast, as the recovery

in housing sales remains subdued. Consumer credit is expected to

continue to contract, albeit at a slower rate. For businesses,

issuance of long-term debt should be sustained if intermediate- and

longer-term interest rates remain around current levels, while

business loans at banks and commercial paper outstanding should fall

noticeably less rapidly as inventory liquidation abates.

(15) The 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds

rate under alternative A would promote faster money growth than under

alternative B, improving the odds that the aggregates would end up in

the ranges. However, relative to previous bluebooks, the staff has



-13-

scaled back its estimate of the response of M2 growth to such a policy

easing. Rather than the customary 1-1/2 percentage point increment to

the growth rate of M2, we now estimate that the added growth would be

more on the order of 1 percentage point at an annual rate. With

returns on non-M1 components of M2 reaching their lowest levels in

several years and falling further relative both to rates on capital

market instruments and to household borrowing costs, households will

have stronger incentives from these channels to pare holdings of non-

transactions M2. This reasoning yields projected M2 growth over the

next three months under alternative A of 4 percent at an annual rate.

Our estimate of the responsiveness of M1 and M3 growth to monetary

policy easing, however, remains approximately unchanged, implying

growth rates of these aggregates of 8 and 2 percent, respectively,

from September to December.
