Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

CLASS I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Immediately following the September 22 FOMC meeting, non-

borrowed reserve paths continued to be constructed assuming $600 million of

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing. Actual borrowing in the first complete

maintenance period, ending October 7, averaged somewhat above the assumed

level, owing in part to unusual borrowing related mostly to Reserve Bank

computer problems. Apart from higher levels around quarter-end, federal

funds traded mainly in a 7-1/4 to 7-1/2 percent range during that maintenance

period, about 1/4 of a percentage point higher than just before the September

meeting. Federal funds and other interest rates subsequently rose further

through mid-October as market participants appeared to anticipate another

monetary tightening in an environment of firmer policy abroad, concerns about

the dollar, and pessimism about U.S. inflation prospects.

(2) Stock prices declined appreciably in the first half of Octo-

ber and, on October 19, share prices plunged in chaotic trading. Investors

attempted to shift large amounts of funds into fixed-income assets, especi-

ally Treasury securities, driving down interest rates sharply. The Federal

Reserve pledged to provide liquidity to the economic and financial system,

and injected reserves aggressively on the following days, amid continuing

volatile market conditions. Federal funds dropped from above 7-1/2 percent

to 7 percent and below immediately following the stock market collapse.

During those days, late in the reserve maintenance period ending October 21,

the Desk sought to avoid the surge in borrowing implied by the formal reserve



path. Actual borrowing rose substantially on the final day of the period,

however, owing to sizable misses in estimates of market factors and required

reserves, boosting borrowing for the two weeks to $525 million. Reflecting

cautious reserve management by depository institutions, excess reserves in-

creased to $1.0 billion.

(3) In the current maintenance period the borrowing assumption

has been reduced to $500 million and then to $450 million, consistent with a

more generous provision of liquidity and easier money market conditions in

the unsettled market environment. The Desk has continued to provide reserves

each day through System repurchase agreements, frequently underscoring its

intentions by entering the market at an early hour. Federal funds traded

mostly in a 7 to 7-1/4 percent range over the early part of the current

maintenance period, but more recently have moved below 7 percent following

massive injections of reserves by the Desk. Total reserve growth in October

accelerated appreciably to a 12 percent annual rate, reflecting the large

increase in required reserves associated with a surge in transactions deposits,

as well as greater demand for excess reserves.

(4) Equity prices have fluctuated sharply over an extraordinar-

ily wide range following their collapse on October 19; with some recovery in

recent days, most major stock indices are now around 10 to 15 percent above

their October lows. Even so, these indices are about 25 to 35 percent below

their peaks of late August, which had implied price-earnings ratios and divi-

dend yields around record levels. Although prices of fixed-income securities

generally rose substantially in the aftermath of the stock market collapse,

these markets also were quite volatile as investor sentiment shifted rapidly

and market-makers were reluctant to take positions. Yields on long-term



Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds have fallen around one percentage

point since stock prices collapsed, reversing much of the run-up since August.

However, with concerns about credit quality accentuated, yields on some low-

rated corporate issues have risen on balance since October 16. With market

participants apparently reassessing the outlook for the economy, inflation,

and monetary policy, bond markets generally have retained their earlier gains

despite some stock market recovery and a sharp drop in the dollar in recent

days. In short-term markets, Treasury bill rates have shown net declines of

1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percentage points since October 16, in association with actual

and anticipated easing of monetary policy as well as increased demands for

safe and liquid instruments, while rates on many private money market instru-

ments have fallen somewhat less. Although securities markets have been less

volatile in recent days, the uncertain effects of previous developments

apparently have led some market participants to limit exposure to some nonbank

dealers by exercising greater caution in lending securities or funds or in

when-issued trading.

(5) The dollar edged lower during the first half of October,

especially after the release of U.S. trade data intensified market concern

over the failure of the U.S. current account balance to improve. Doubts over

the status of the Louvre accord were heightened by Secretary Baker's public

criticisms of German monetary tightening. Though the dollar firmed somewhat

during the worldwide stock market collapse, by the end of that week the dol-

lar again came under downward pressure amid widespread rumors that dollar

exchange rates under the Louvre accord would be allowed to adjust downward.

In addition, interest rates in the United States had dropped substantially

relative to those in other major industrial countries. As the dollar con-



tinued to fall, U.S. monetary authorities intervened in size.

Over the entire intermeeting period, the dollar declined by about 4 percent

on a weighted average basis. U.S. intervention came to $460 million,

; the Bank of England also reduced its official

lending rates by 1/2 percentage point, and U.K. short-term market rates

dropped by about 1-1/8 percentage points from mid-October. Money market

rates in Japan were little changed during the period, while those in Germany

declined substantially very late in the period. Long-term bond rates dropped

by 70, 110, and 90 basis points in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom,

respectively.

(6) Preliminary data indicate an acceleration in the growth of

all the monetary aggregates in October, associated in large measure with

massive portfolio adjustments in the wake of the collapse in equity prices.

Demand deposits rose sharply after midmonth as financial transactions volumes

surged. In addition, there were strong flows into currency, and money market

funds jumped reflecting shifts to more liquid assets. Managed liabilities of

banks also increased, partly to finance a sharp rise in security loans.

These loans picked up appreciably right after midmonth, perhaps to fund en-

larged stock inventories in the hands of specialists and temporary liquidity

needs of mutual funds as well as to substitute for dealer RP borrowing when

that market turned less hospitable; in addition, banks reported that some

dealers were taking down loans to test existing credit arrangements. Ml is

estimated to have increased at around a 15 percent rate in October, while M2



-5-

and M3 picked up to 6-3/4 and 7-1/4 percent rates, respectively. Growth of

the broader aggregates over September and October averaged about 6 percent,

as compared with the Committee's short-run paths of 4 percent and 6 percent

for M2 and M3, respectively. By October, M2 had increased at a 4-1/2 percent

rate from the fourth-quarter 1986 base of its longer-run range and M3 at a

5-1/2 percent rate.

(7) Growth of the aggregates had slackened in September from

their relatively strong August pace. Flows into liquid deposits generally

were subdued, extending the pattern since this spring of substitution into

higher yielding instruments as market rates rose and the bank deposit yield

curve steepened. Reflecting the effects of the uptrend in interest rates

earlier in the year, the velocities of the broader aggregates rose in the

third quarter at a pace close to their increases over the first half of the

year. M1 velocity turned up sharply in the third quarter, to a 6 percent

rate, following its 2-1/2 year drop.

(8) Growth of nonfinancial debt picked up a bit in September

to a 7-3/4 percent pace, owing in part to an increase in financial restruc-

turing activity by businesses and some strengthening of consumer credit.

September's growth left the debt aggregate near the middle of its 8 to 11

percent annual range. In October, bond offerings by well-rated firms had

been very light over the first half of the month but burgeoned following the

drop in interest rates, and hundreds of firms have announced stock repurchase

programs in light of lower share prices. Tax-exempt bond issuance, on the

other hand, had not yet picked up by month-end despite the decline in muni-

cipal bond yields. Federal borrowing ballooned in October as the Treasury

made up for offerings that had earlier been deferred owing to debt-ceiling

constraints.

Policy alternatives

(9) Securities markets have been somewhat less volatile in recent

days, but investor psychology remains unsettled and financial markets are

likely to stay skittish for quite awhile. Moreover, the effects of the

stock market crash on financial institutions and nonfinancial sectors are

uncertain, and are likely to surface only gradually. In these circumstances,

a greater element of flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy would

seem appropriate, at least over the near term. In addition to standing

ready to provide liquidity should it be required in the event of particular

financial strains, the Federal Reserve also may need to be more prepared

than usual to adjust the basic stance of monetary policy as emerging economic

trends become more apparent.

(10) The three policy options presented in this bluebook embody

the staff's working assumption that conditions in financial markets will

gradually return more to normal, as the fears and dislocations that accom-

panied the plunge in stock prices subside further. Thus, as usual, the

options are keyed to the various borrowing assumptions, though, as noted

above and embodied in Variant I of the draft directive discussed in para-

graph (19), policy may well have to be implemented with greater flexibility

than under less uncertain conditions. One additional source of uncertainty

is the relationship between a given borrowing assumption and the associated

pressures in money markets. An increased reluctance by depository institu-

tions to be seen at the discount window would lead to more vigorous bidding

for funds in the market and higher federal funds rates for any particular

borrowing level. In the discussion, the staff has assumed that the return

to less turbulent conditions will be consistent with no more than a slight



drawing back from the discount window. If market conditions remain un-

settled or depository institutions are concerned about perceptions of their

safety and soundness, the assumed borrowing levels would be associated with

higher federal funds rates; alternatively in such conditions, the federal

funds and money market rates discussed under each alternative would require,

at least temporarily, somewhat lower borrowing objectives. With markets

particularly sensitive to incoming information, shifting expectations about

the course of monetary policy could also affect the federal funds rate for

a time. In these circumstances the borrowing-funds rate relationships given

in paragraph (11) are subject to considerable uncertainties.

(11) Alternative B would maintain the easier reserve conditions

that have come to prevail recently; the assumption for adjustment and sea-

sonal borrowing would remain at $450 million, with federal funds trading

expected to center at 7 percent or a bit below. Additional easing would be

sought under alternative A, either through a further reduction in the bor-

rowing assumption to $250 million or a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate;

the funds rate would be likely to fall to, or a little below, the 6-1/2

percent area. Alternative C would involve some slight firming of reserve

conditions, with borrowing being increased to $550 million and the funds

rate probably moving back to around 7-1/4 percent.

(12) The table below presents outcomes for money growth from

September to December that might be expected to accompany each of these

alternatives.1/ The margin of uncertainty surrounding these point estimates

1. The current directive references FOMC expectations for money growth
from August to December. However, with monetary data for September now
essentially complete, the usual practice of using the last month of the
previous quarter as the base has been followed in specifying the alter-
natives in this bluebook. Implied growth rates under each alternative from
August to December, and from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth
quarter of 1987, can be found on the detailed table on page 10.



is considerably larger than usual. The extent to which heightened liquidity

preferences together with substantial variations in the volumes of financial

transactions could affect future demands for the monetary aggregates is

difficult to gauge at present. How quickly money markets and depositories

will re-establish a more normal structure of short-term market and deposit

interest rates--and therefore the movement of opportunity costs--under each

alternative also is hard to assess.

(13) Under alternative B, persistence of the federal funds rate

near 7 percent implies that a substantial rise of Treasury bill rates would

accompany a partial restoration of normal interest rate relationships. As

exceptional demands for short-term Treasuries unwind, the 3-month bill rate

could move from the current 5-1/4 percent level to perhaps around 6 percent,

while private rates might rise relatively little. Even with a rate backup,

short-term rates would be 1/2 to 1 full percentage point below their aver-

age levels prior to the stock market crash. As a consequence, opportunity

costs of liquid deposits would still be appreciably below early fall peaks.

Interest rate incentives could thus begin to reinforce the impact of any

added liquidity preference in bolstering inflows to the liquid deposit and

money market fund components of the aggregates. At the same time, however,

a return toward more normal volumes of financial transactions would tend to

depress demand deposits from recently elevated levels. Under these condi-

tions, M2 might expand from September to December at around a 6 percent

annual rate. This outcome would bring M2 growth for the year to 4-1/2 per-

cent, compared with its 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent long-run range. Growth of

its M1 component would be expected to slow substantially following its

October bulge, with growth at 8 percent over the September to December

period and about 7 percent for the year.

(14) M3 growth over the fourth quarter at around 7 percent is

expected under alternative B, bringing growth for the year to 5-3/4 per-

cent, just within its annual range. Bank and thrift assets are expected

to grow at a moderate pace. The recent bulge in security loans at banks

is likely to be at least partly reversed; business loans might be fairly

strong, however, despite somewhat greater issuance of investment-grade

bonds, as inventory accumulation boosts financing needs and planned funding

with junk bonds of loans for leveraged buyouts is postponed. Overall, the

debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at around an

8 percent rate from September to December, implying growth of 9 percent

from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987.

(15) Under the reserve market conditions of alternative B, most

bond yields might edge higher as the increased preference for fixed-income

securities subsides and the possibility of further near-term monetary ease

is seen as diminishing. However, market concerns about potential softness



-12-

in economic activity and the associated scaling back of inflation expecta-

tions could keep long-term rates below their levels at the time of the last

FOMC meeting. Downward pressures on the value of the dollar in foreign ex-

change markets could continue as market attention focuses on U.S. external

imbalances, and would be accentuated by any perceptions that foreign mone-

tary authorities were unwilling to adopt more expansionary policies. If

dollar weakness occurred in the context of subdued growth in the U.S. econ-

omy and, particularly around the time of the Treasury's midquarter refunding,

of continued foreign participation in U.S. securities markets, bond prices

might be little affected. But if pressures on the dollar are accentuated

by disappointing progress in federal deficit reduction or if U.S. economic

activity remains robust, an inverse relationship between the dollar and

bond yields could reemerge.

(16) Under alternative A, the further easing of the funds rate

could help allay investor concerns about immediate financial strains. Other

private rates in money markets would slip off further, although the 3-month

bill rate might rise into the 5-1/2 percent area. Precautionary demands for

liquid monetary assets might unwind more rapidly under this alternative.

But the sharply narrower spreads of market over deposit rates would seem

likely to encourage large inflows into liquid accounts. Growth in OCDs

would be especially affected, with expansion in M1 likely to average 9 per-

cent over September to December. M2 would be expected to increase at a

6-1/2 percent rate over this interval as its nontransaction components

picked up noticeably from September when inflows had been damped by pre-

vious increases in interest rates.



-13-

(17) Under alternative A, long-term bond yields would likely

continue to decline as market perceptions of impending weakness in the

economy tended to work against a revival of inflation concerns. However,

should the dollar fall precipitously on foreign exchange markets or the

further easing of policy be seen at some point as imparting substantial

strength to the outlook for the economy or prices, any drop in long-term

yields might be quite limited. While downward pressure on the dollar

could well intensify under this alternative, foreign central banks might

be more likely to ease monetary policies as the outlook for their export

industries weakens further.

(18) Alternative C calls for a slight firming of reserve pres-

sures, indexed by an increase in borrowing of only $100 million, and a rise

in the federal funds rate to 7-1/4 percent. The small increase in reserve

pressures under this alternative would better guard against substantial

further weakness in the exchange value of the dollar, but would leave bor-

rowing and the federal funds rate a bit below levels prior to the stock

market crash. Even so, the choice of alternative C before any dollar

decline were generally linked with renewed inflation concerns would risk

further disquieting domestic financial markets. A downward movement of

prices in private credit and equity markets would be likely, although if

the tightening were seen as contributing to economic weakness or damping

any incipient inflation, the rally in the Treasury bond market could be

extended. The 3-month Treasury bill rate could move into the 6-1/2 per-

cent area, with private short-term rates also rising appreciably. Growth

in the aggregates under alternative C would be retarded a little over the

rest of the quarter by the renewed upward movement in opportunity costs



-14-

on monetary assets. M2 growth would be expected to be around a 5-3/4

percent rate over September to December, though its M1 component still

would register growth around 7-1/2 percent given its October bulge. Both

aggregates would be entering the new year on fairly slow underlying growth

paths. The restraining effect on M3 would be muted as business credit

demands shifted more to banks and other short-term sources in response to

less attractive long-term financing.

Directive language

(19) Draft language for the operational paragraph is shown

below, with two variants proposed for Committee consideration. Variant I

takes account explicitly in several ways of the possible need to continue

to implement policy with special flexibility over the coming intermeeting

period, given unusual uncertainties about conditions in financial markets

and the economy. It also addresses the potential for exceptional demands

for liquidity.

Variant II follows the language of the current directive much

more closely, with relatively minor modifications to take account of

heightened market and economic uncertainties. This variant is shown with

proposed changes and additions in the usual strike-through and capitalized

form.

In keeping with the asymmetric specifications in the bluebook,

alternative A calls for decreasing "somewhat" and alternative C for increas-

ing "slightly" the degree of pressure on reserve positions.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

Variant I

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to [decrease somewhat (Alt. A)] [maintain (Alt. B)]

[increase slightly (Alt.C)] the existing degree of pressure on reserves

positions; the Committee anticipates that this approach to operations

will prove consistent with its desire to ensure the provision of

adequate liquidity in the present economic and financial environment.

The Committee recognizes that the volatile conditions in financial



-16-

markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may call for a special

degree of flexibility in open market operations. Somewhat/slightly lesser

reserve restraint would/might, or somewhat/slightly greater reserve

restraint would/might, be acceptable depending on conditions in financial

markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflation-

ary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the

behavior of the monetary aggregates. The outlook for monetary growth

over the months ahead is subject to unusual uncertainty. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3

over the period from September through December at annual rates of around

____ percent and around ____ percent, respectively, but more rapid growth is

possible should preferences for liquidity be particularly strong. Over

the same period, growth in M1 is expected to be well above its average

pace in the previous several months. The Committee anticipates that

relatively frequent consultations might have to be called by the Chairman

over the coming intermeeting period, particularly if unsettled market

conditions imply the need for unusual flexibility in the implementation

of policy. The Chairman may also call for Committee consultation if it

appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions

during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____to ____ per-

cent.

Variant II

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SLIGHTLY (Alt. C) the EXISTING degree of pressure on reserve



-17-

positions [DEL: sought in recent weeks]. Somewhat (slightly) greater reserve

restraint or somewhat (slightly) lesser reserve restraint would (might)

be acceptable depending on CONDITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, indications

of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, develop-

ments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the MONETARY

aggregates. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2

and M3 over the period from [DEL: August] SEPTEMBER through December at annual

rates of around [DEL: 4] ____ percent and around [DEL: 6] ____ percent, respectively. OVER

THE SAME PERIOD, GROWTH IN M1 is expected to [DEL: continue to grow relatively

slowly] BE WELL ABOVE ITS AVERAGE PACE OF THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL MONTHS. The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager

for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before

the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of [DEL: 5 to 9] ___ to ___ percent.
