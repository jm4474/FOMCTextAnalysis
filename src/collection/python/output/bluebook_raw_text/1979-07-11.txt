Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 growth slowed to a ¾ percent annual rate in May but

picked up sharply in June, and for the two-month policy period is estimated

at about a 7 percent annual rate, well above the 0 to 5 percent range

selected by the FOMC. M-2 is estimated to have grown at a 9 percent

annual rate over May and June, also above its 4 to 8 percent range

specified by the Committee. Bank sales of money market certificates (MMCs)

have strengthened considerably since the March regulatory changes eliminated

the differential in ceiling rates favoring thrift institutions so long as

the 6-month bill rate was 9 percent or above. In addition, outflows from

other small time deposits have nearly stopped in recent weeks, and a gain

was recorded in savings deposits in June for the first time since last

September. As banks have captured a larger share of the MMC market, growth

of such deposits at S&Ls has eroded, but flows into other small-denomination

accounts at thrifts have improved recently. On balance, deposit growth at

thrift institutions has accelerated in the last two months from the

unusually slow pace of April, reaching a 7 percent annual rate in June

on a monthly average basis.

(2) Banks have continued to account for a relatively large

share of overall credit flows. Total loans and investments expanded at

a 12 percent annual rate, on average, in May and June, funded mainly by

demand deposits and money market certificates. Commercial banks paid down

about $12 billion of outstanding large denomination time deposits in

May and June, which was about offset by increases in Eurodollar takings

from foreign branches and in domestic nondeposit borrowing.

(3) After the May FOMC meeting, the Federal funds rate continued

to be held at around 10¼ percent. By mid-June, projections for the growth

rates of both M-1 and M-2 indicated that both would be above their

respective short-run ranges. On June 15 a majority of the FOMC concurred

in the Chairman's recommendation that the objective for the funds rate

remain about 10¼ percent in view of the many indications of a weakening

in economic activity and the uncertainties in the financial and economic

outlook. Accordingly, the Desk has continued to aim for this funds rate

level in the past three weeks. In the latest statement week, however,

the funds rate averaged 10.42 percent, even while banks' excess reserves

rose to $621 million, in reflection of pressures and uncertainties associated

with the mid-year statement date and the July 4 holiday.

(4) Reserves required against private demand deposits increased

at a 10¼ percent annual rate over the May-June period, reflecting the

accelerated growth of such deposits. Nonetheless, total reserves contracted

at about a 2¾ percent annual rate, as reserves held against total time and

savings deposits declined sharply in association with the run-offs of



large time deposits over the last two months. The monetary base expanded

at about a 4 percent annual rate over the May-June period, close to

the pace set in the earlier months of the year and about half the growth

rate of last year. Currency held by the nonbank public, which rose at a

7¼ percent annual rate, together with vault cash at nonmember banks continued

to account for all of the growth of the monetary base.

(5) Despite the stability of the Federal funds rate, market

interest rates declined substantially following the May FOMC meeting. The

pervasive declines in interest rates apparently reflected growing acceptance

of the view that the economy had weakened and that interest rates had peaked.

However, in the last few days interest rates have backed up somewhat. On

balance, over the intermeeting period, Treasury bill rates have fallen 40 to

75 basis points, private short-term yields 20 to 50 basis points, and the

prime rate was reduced 25 basis points to 11-1/2 percent. The particularly sharp

decline in bill rates appears to have been associated with the Treasury's

paydown of cash management bills in late June and the resumption of purchases

of bills by foreign central banks. In bond markets, corporate and Treasury

yields declined some 40 basis points. Despite these declines, mortgage

yields have risen steadily, and the average rate on new commitments at

S&Ls is now above 11 percent.

(6) The dollar's exchange value has declined 3¼ percent on a

weighted average basis, and somewhat more against the mark and the Swiss

franc, since the last meeting of the Committee. All of these declines

occurred in the last half of June. They were triggered by the surge in

U.S. monetary aggregates in an environment of declining U.S. short-term

interest rates at a time when money market conditions in many major



-4-

industrial countries were firming.

rates of change, in percent, for related monetary and financial flows over

various time periods.

Prospective developments: long-run

(8) The Humphrey-Hawkins Act requires the Federal Reserve to

report to Congress in July any revision in its growth ranges for the

aggregates for the current calendar year. In addition, the Act requires

as part of the July report "a statement of ... objectives and plans with

respect to the ranges of growth ... of the monetary and credit aggregates

for the calendar year following the year in which the report is submitted."

Thus, at its July meeting the FOMC will need to reassess the ranges pre-

viously set for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 policy period and establish initial

ranges for the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period.

(9) As background for the Committee's deliberations, it may be

noted that growth rates of the key monetary aggregates in the first six months

of the current policy period are within their longer-run ranges adopted in

February, as shown in the table below. Bank credit, however, has grown at

a rate above the upper end of its range, as credit demands on banks and

banks' use of nondeposit funds have been stronger than expected.

Actual Annual Rate of Current Longer-run Ranges
Growth QIV '78 to QII '79 for QIV '78 to QIV '79 Period

M-1 2.7 1½ to 4½

M-2 5.2 5 to 8

M-3 6.3 6 to 9

Bank Credit 11.5 7½ to 10½



(10) Shown below for Committee consideration are three

alternative longer-run ranges applicable to the current QIV '78 to

QIV '79 policy period.1/

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

M-1 3½ to 6½ 3 to 6 2½ to 5½

M-2 5 to 8 5 to 8 4½ to 7½

M-3 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9 5½ to 8½

Bank Credit 9 to 12 8½ to 11½ 8 to 11

(11) The ranges for the money supply aggregates under

alternative B are the same as those adopted by the Committee in February,

except that the M-1 range has been revised upward to reflect a changed

projection of ATS account growth (including New York state NOW accounts).

At the time of the February meeting, shifts from demand deposits to ATS

accounts were expected to reduce measured M-1 growth by about 3 percentage

points over the year. Thus, the 3 percent midpoint of the FOMC's current

1 to 4 percent longer-run range for M-1 was consistent with a

6 percent rate of growth in M-1 adjusted for ATS effects. The retardation

in measured M-1 growth caused by ATS is now expected to be about half

as large as estimated in February. The midpoint of the 3 to 6 percent

proposed alternative B range plus the revised, lower ATS effect also is equal

to an M-1 growth adjusted for ATS effects of about 6 percent.

1/ All of the proposed ranges are 3 percentage points in width--the same
as the ranges adopted in February. An argument can be made, however,
that the ranges should be narrowed since the policy period now contains
two quarters of known results and, therefore, the Committee should be
more certain of the rate of growth in the aggregates over the entire
period. On the other hand, it can be argued that the considerable
uncertainties about the current money-income relationship suggest the
desirability of maintaining the existing width of the ranges.



(12) Alternatives A and C, respectively, represent somewhat

easier and tighter policies with regard to the aggregates. Alternative A

is indexed by measured M-1 growth centered around 5 percent (6-1/2 per-

cent after adjustment for ATS effects) and alternative C by measured

growth of around 4 percent (5-1/2 percent after ATS effects). These

growth rates can be viewed as representing orderly movement toward rates

of increase in M-1 (adjusted for ATS effects) of 7 and 5 percent respectively

in 1980, with the slightly different growth rates for 1979 reflecting

the relatively short period remaining this year in which to influence

the growth of the aggregate. For alternatives A and B, the M-2 ranges

are the same because the lower interest rates under alternative A more

promptly open the ceiling rate differential on MMCs favoring thrift

institutions, thereby diverting funds from commercial bank time deposits

to thrift deposits. In all alternatives, growth ranges for bank credit

are above the current range, because of the relatively rapid growth in

such credit thus far this year.

(13) The table below presents three alternative longer-run

ranges for next year (the policy period from QIV '79 to QIV '80). These

ranges represent a continuation into 1980 of the policies toward the

Alt. A' Alt. B' Alt. C'

M-1 4½ to 7½ 3½ to 6½ 2½ to 5½

M-2 6½ to 9½ 5½ to 8½ 4½ to 7½

M-3 7½ to 10½ 6 to 9 4½ to 7½

Bank Credit 7½ to 10½ 6½ to 9½ 5½ to 8½



aggregates as indexed by M-1, represented by the proposed paths for 1979,

after adjustment for ATS effects. Thus, alternative B' essentially repre-

sents continuation of growth in M-1 at about 6 percent: the midpoint of

the alternative B' range is 5 per cent, and we have assumed that ATS

effects retard M-1 growth by only about 1 percent. Of course, the

projection of ATS effects into next year is highly uncertain, depending

as it does on as yet unknown Congressional or further judicial responses

to the recent court decision terminating ATS and similar accounts beginning
1/

January 1 of next year. Alternatives A' and C' are indexed by measured

M-1 growth of 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, or 7 and 5 percent

after adjusting for assumed ATS effects. These growth rates for 1980

basically extend the A and C paths for 1979, as explained in the preceding

paragraph.

(14) The Federal funds rate patterns through 1980 associated

with the proposed longer-run monetary ranges, given the related GNP pro-

jections, are shown in appendix I. For simplicity, these patterns assume

that the growth path for the aggregates adopted for 1979 will continue

into 1980. Thus, they assume that alternative B for 1979 is followed by

1/ If the court decision does become effective, measured M-1 growth in
the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period could be increased by 1 to 2 percentage
points, depending on how much of the funds shifted from demand deposits
to ATS accounts returned to demand deposits. On the other hand, if the
Congress authorizes nationwide NOW accounts, the staff estimates that
measured M-1 growth in the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period could be retarded
by as much as 3 to 4 percentage points rather than the 1 percentage
point if ATS accounts are extended.



-10-

1/
alternative B' for 1980, A by A', and C by C', Under alternative

B/B'--an unchanged policy with respect to the aggregates--the Federal

funds rate is expected to decline somewhat by early 1980 (to a level

of around 9-1/2 percent), assuming economic activity weakens about as

projected. As growth in nominal GNP accelerates in 1980, this decline

is projected to be reversed in order to constrain growth in the

aggregates to around the midpoints of the B' range. It should be noted

that the upward pressure on interest rates re-emerges even though we

have assumed a rather substantial downward shift in money demand

relative to income in 1980.

Prospective developments: short-run

(15) Three alternative short-run specifications for the

monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate are presented below for

Committee consideration. (More detailed and longer-run data are shown

in the tables on pages 11 and 12.)

alternatives over the 1979 and 1980 period that can be constructed
from those presented in the blue book. The paths that are shown
represent the tightest and easiest alternatives with respect to the

aggregates that can be constructed from those presented, as well as
an unchanged alternative.

(16) Alternative II contemplates no change in the current 9-3/4

to 10-1/2 percent Federal funds rate range, nor in the Desk's current

10-1/4 percent objective within that range. Under those conditions,

M-1 in the July-August period is expected to increase in a 2-1/2 to 6-1/2

percent annual rate range--slower than the average rate of expansion in

recent months, reflecting the projected further slowdown in expansion

of nominal GNP. In the third quarter M-1 is expected to expand about

in line with nominal GNP and V-1, therefore, to show little net change
1/

for the second consecutive quarter.

(17) As illustrated by the top panel of the chart on page 14,

growth in measured M-1 at the 4-1/2 percent midpoint of its projected

July-August alternative II range would leave M-1 in the upper half of

its current longer-run range. The lower panel of the chart compares

the projected July-August expansion with the proposed alternative B

longer-run range. In that comparison, by August M-1 would be in the

lower half of the longer-run range. The dotted line in the chart also

shows annual growth rates needed from the actual June level to reach

targeted midpoint levels by the fourth quarter of 1979 under the

current longer-run range and proposed alternative B; these growth rates
2/

are 2 percent and 5-1/2 percent, respectively.

the current and three proposed longer-run alternatives growth
ranges for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 policy period.

(18) The staff expects M-2 to expand in a 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 per-

cent annual rate range in July-August under alternative II. As shown in

the upper panel of the chart on page 16, M-2 in June was at a level

slightly below the midpoint of its longer-run range. Growth at the

midpoint of the alternative II range would bring M-2 to about the mid-

point of its current (and also proposed alternative B) longer-run

growth range by August.

(19) Virtually all of the expected slowing in M-2 in July-

August, relative to May-June, reflects the more modest growth of M-1.

Growth of the interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to remain

strong, accounted for mainly by continued sizable bank issuance of

MMCs. Inflows of funds to banks through MMCs are expected to remain

large, since the staff is projecting that the 6-month bill rate under

alternative II will remain near or above 9 percent and thus that no

significant differential will emerge in ceiling rates on these instru-

ments favoring thrift institutions. As in other recent months, large-

denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute to growth

in M-2 as banks continue to supplement their demand and small denomination

time deposits growth with Eurodollars and RPs.

(20) Deposit growth at thrifts in coming months is expected

to remain near the second quarter pace, but--with banks continuing to

capture an enlarged share of net MMC sales--well below the pace set in the

second half of 1978 and early 1979 prior to the change in MMC regulations.

As a result, as shown in the lower panel of the chart on page 16, M-3

growth is likely to stay near the low end of its longer-run range. S&Ls

can be expected to continue to draw down their liquid assets and to tap

nondeposit funds in substantial quantity in order to meet their mortgage

commitments in the face of restrained deposit flows.

(21) If the funds rate remains around 10¼ percent as contemplated

under alternative II, short-term rates might back up somewhat as fewer

market participants come to expect that interest rates will soon decline.

If short-term rates rise, this may work to strengthen the dollar on foreign

exchange markets since it will tend to improve interest rate spreads

between U.S. and foreign markets. Yields in bond markets might also rise,

especially in the municipal market where a relatively large slate of

offerings is in prospect. In corporate bond markets, on the other hand,

issuance is expected to be relatively light and the Treasury is likely

to raise only $2 to $3 billion of new money in a routine mid-quarter

financing.

(22) Alternative III contemplated a ½ percentage point rise

in the Federal funds over the next few weeks to the midpoint of a 10 to

II percent range. Such an approach to policy appears most consistent

with a reduction in the longer-run growth range for the aggregates, as

proposed in alternative C/C'. In the present environment, a tightening

of the funds rate objective would be expected to have rather significant

and widespread effects. The value of the dollar would strengthen in



-18-

foreign exchange markets more certainly than under alternative II, and

domestic short-term interest rates would rise considerably. The initial

reaction in bond markets would probably mirror that of short-term debt

markets. But in view of the evidence of the weakening in the economy,

market participants would be likely to see a tightening at this time as a

temporary measure. Thus, any tendency for bond yields to rise would be

limited as long-term investors sought to lock in attractive long-term yields

near their cyclical highs.

(23) Alternative I involves a percentage point decrease in the

Federal funds rate to the center of a 9 to 10 percent range. Such a move

appears most consistent with the higher longer-run growth rates for the

monetary aggregates associated with alternative A/A'. It would not

necessarily be inconsistent with longer-run alternative B, under which

interest rates are expected to begin declining later in the summer or in

early fall. A modest reduction in the Federal funds rate over the near

term, especially if it occurs along with new data suggesting further weak-

ness in economic activity, is likely to be accompanied by a fairly

substantial drop in market rates--as market participants come to expect

even more monetary ease ahead. In this environment, the dollar would

probably weaken substantially further on exchange markets, and the spread

of Treasury bill rates below private rates would widen as foreign official

institutions acquired Treasury securities in the wake of intervention

activity. The drop in Treasury bill rates will reintroduce a full 25

basis points differential on MMC ceiling rates in favor of thrift

institutions, leading to weaker M-2 growth in the short run under

alternative I than under alternative II.

Directive language

(24) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive in the customary form, with alternative language related

to the short-run specifications presented in the preceding section.

Alternative language is also provided for placing main emphasis either on

monetary aggregates or on money market conditions. The specifications

adopted last month are shown in strike-through form.

In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while

giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange

value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic

financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular

meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at

maintaining the (or ATTAINING A) weekly average federal funds

ra e

(I) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(II) at about the current level.
(III) SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 9¾ to 10½]

____ TO ____ percent. In deciding on the specific objective for

the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the

relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth

in the [DEL: May-June] JULY-AUGUST period of M-1 and M-2 and the following

ranges of tolerance: [DEL: 0 to 5] ____ TO ____ percent for M-1 and [DEL: 4 to 8½]

____ TO ____ percent for M-2. If, with approximately equal weight



-20-

given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be

Monetary aggregates emphasis

SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE OR BELOW THE MIDPOINTS

Money market emphasis

close to or beyond the upper or lower limits

of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be

raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above

the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges

at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been

moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will

promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions of 6-month
bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. Data in column 5 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns 8 through 11, the weekly
date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotas for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end
of the statement week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios made
by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding
the end of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly
auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for
immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
