MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Since the October meeting, the narrowly defined money stock

(M1) has been running well below the path associated with the policy directive

adopted at that meeting. This marks the third consecutive inter-meeting period

in which there has been a substantial shortfall. On the average in October, M1

declined at a 2.6 per cent annual rate, in contrast to the expectation that it

would rise at a 3 per cent rate. M2 and the adjusted bank credit proxy also

fell below target paths in October, as the table on the next page shows.

However, shortfalls in these aggregates were much less than for M1, as time

and savings deposits other than large CD's grew more rapidly than expected,

offsetting part of the weakness in demand deposits.

(2) In recent months the staff has been projecting that growth in

M1 would slow considerably in the fourth quarter, partly in response to lagged

effects of earlier high interest rates. But a sustained contraction in the

outstanding money stock was not anticipated. The shrinkage which has occurred

began shortly after the President's announcement of his new economic program--

suggesting that the changed circumstances created by the program may have in-

duced important shifts in the demand for domestic money balances at given

interest rates. As previously reported, the Demand Deposit Ownership Survey

for August indicated that the relative drop-off in IPC accounts for that month

was centered in deposits of nonfinancial businesses--a development that is

consistent with other evidence suggesting heavy transfers of business funds

into foreign currencies. Ownership data just available for September indicate

that the continuing relative weakness of demand deposits in that month was

spread more widely through all major ownership groups. Whether this September

pattern of change carried through into October is not yet known.

(3) With the money supply aggregates falling persistently below

path the Desk aimed for gradually easier money market conditions as the inter-

meeting period progressed. Initially, the objective was to achieve money

market conditions characterized by a funds rate in the 5 to 5-1/8 per cent

range, but as new evidence on the aggregates emerged, the aiming point was

lowered to around 5 per cent or a little less. Most recently, with the

discount rate reduced to 4-3/4 per cent, Federal funds have been trading

around 4-7/8 per cent. And, asweakness in the aggregates continued, the Desk

has begun to aim at a 4-3/4 per cent funds rate. Over the three full state-

ment weeks of the inter-meeting period the net reserve position of member

banks fluctuated between $200 million free reserves and $370 million net

borrowed reserves, with the average for the period $ 90 million on the

negative side. Over the same period weekly member bank borrowing ranged

from $122 million to $414 million and averaged $250 million.

(4) Between the last meeting of the Committee and the discount

rate reduction of November 10, the easing in day-to-day money market con-

ditions and growing uncertainty about business prospects brought further

reductions in market interest rates of 10-15 basis points on some types of

longer-term securities and of from 20 to 50 basis points on short-term



-4-

securities. The bank prime rate was cut from 6 to 5-1/2 per cent. As rates

declined market expectations of a discount rate cut became widespread. At the

same time, the overhang of unsold securities in the market was building up.

Government security dealers added more than $2 billion to their net positions--

about half in maturities of more than 5 years--as a result of the recent

financings. Aggressive bidding by underwriters for new corporate, Federal

agency, and municipal issues also added to security inventories. With the

technical position of markets thus coming under some strain, there were

scattered yield advances just prior to the discount rate cut.

(5) There was little immediate reaction to the discount rate

move. The market did steady, but attitudes nevertheless appear to remain

cautious. The 3-month bill rate was most recently quoted 4.17 per cent bid,

about the same as its level just prior to the discount rate reduction and

about 30 basis points below its level at the time of the previous FOMC meeting.

(6) Over the three statement weeks ending November 10, required

reserves fell consistently below path as shown in the table on the following

page. Nonborrowed reserves available to banks also remained below path over

the period on balance, as the Desk, while easing, attempted to avoid an overly

rapid easing of money market conditions. With banks also reducing their

borrowings from the Federal Reserve under the easier conditions, total

reserves were well below path.

(7) The preceding analysis has not been based on the newly revised

monetary aggregate series since those were not available during the inter-

meeting period. This latest annual revision is generally minor in its effect.

This is particularly true for the monthly money supply series, for which

Prospective developments

(8) Two alternative sets of specifications for Committee

consideration are summarized in the text table below. The two sets of

specifications correspond to three directive alternatives, with the

first set associated with both directive A and B and the second set

with directive C. As noted in the final section of this blue book, the

choice between directives A and B depends on the degree of emphasis the

Committee wishes to place on monetary aggregates as compared with money

market conditions.

Alternative A/B Alternative C

Federal funds rate 4-1/2--4-7/8 3-7/8--4-1/2

Member bank borrowings 150-300 50-150

Growth in M (SAAR)

November -1 -1
December 1-1/2 3

4th Q. 1971 0 1/2
1st Q. 1972 6 8

(9) Money market conditions consistent with alternative A/B

might encompass a Federal funds rate in a 4-1/2--4-7/8 per cent range;

member bank borrowings in a $150-$300 million range; and, taking account

of recent wide swings in excess reserves, a net reserve position for

member banks in a plus $250 million to minus $150 million area. These

conditions are somewhat easier than prevailed at the time of the last

Committee meeting, and reflect a response over the past few weeks to the

weakness of the monetary aggregates and, in recent days, to the reduction



in the discount rate. Alternative C would imply a significant further

easing of money market conditions from those that have recently evolved,

with, for example, the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with

this alternative in a 3-7/8--4-1/2 per cent range.

(10) Under alternative A/B, we would expect the 3-month bill

rate to be in a 4--4-5/8 per cent range between now and mid-December.

The bill rate could rise from recent levels in response to normal seasonal

pressures, particularly in view of the current wide spread of the funds

rate above the bill rate. In addition, the Treasury is expected to raise

$3 billion of new cash in the bill area in late November. The Treasury

will have to raise another $2--$3 billion of cash before year-end, but

it seems likely at this point that this operation will not be undertaken

until late December. Sizable sales of bills by foreign central banks in the

event of reflows of funds from abroad would also tend to exert pressure

on the bill market. Under alternative C, however, short-term interest

rates would almost certainly decline over the period ahead, with the bill

rate likely to be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range.

(11) The monthly and quarterly paths for monetary aggregates

for the two sets of suggested specifications are detailed in the table

on the next page. These paths are based on the newly revised series.

(Two tables on pages 17 and 18 at the end of the text show weekly paths

for the monetary aggregates and more detail on aggregate reserves.)

(12) The narrow money supply (M1) under alternative A/B is

expected to show only a slight decline in November at a one per cent

annual rate, but to resume growth beginning in December. On the basis

-11-

of past relationships, the depressant effect on money demand of the

high short-term interest rates of late spring and summer should have

about run its course. Prospects for a reduced rate of inflation in-

duced by the new economic program have probably also encouraged money

holders to reduce cash balances relative to income, offsetting the

large build-up of spring and early summer. With these two types of

adjustments largely completed, it appears that money supply should

soon begin rising more in line with the transactions demands implicit

in the staff's GNP forecast, which indicates about a 9 per cent rate of

rise on average in nominal GNP in the fourth and first quarters. M 1

is expected to grow at only a 1-1/2 per cent annual rate from November

to December, but to be followed by a 6 per cent growth rate in the first

quarter. The lower interest rates and greater reserve supply under

alternative C would likely lead to a more rapid 3 per cent rate of growth

in December, followed by an 8 per cent expansion in the first quarter.

(13) Growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's

is expected to slow in late November and December from the recent rapid

pace. On balance, under alternative A/B, we would anticipate a growth

rate in consumer-type time deposits of around 11 per cent in the fourth

quarter, but slowing to about 7 per cent in the first quarter as consumer

spending continues to rise. Such a development would lead to growth

rates for M2 of 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 per cent in the fourth and first quarters,

respectively. Growth rates would be somewhat more rapid under alterna-

tive C as lower market interest rates enhanced the relative attractiveness

of bank deposits.



-12-

(14) Although the outstanding amount of large CD's and non-

deposit sources has shown little net change in recent weeks, these sources

of funds, particularly large CD's, are expected to resume expansion in

the period ahead. The expansion is likely to be moderate, however, under

either alternative. Over the balance of this year, business loan demands

are expected to be modest in view of the continued comparatively large

volume of capital market financing and the relatively small rate of business

inventory accumulation anticipated. Under alternative C there could be a

pick-up in business borrowing from banks as lending terms ease further,

but the increased inflow of demand and consumer-type deposits associated

with that alternative would probably generate enough resources so that

banks would not need to be more aggressive in that CD market.

(15) With private demand deposits flat and outstanding U.S.

Government deposits declining on balance over the fourth quarter, the

bank credit proxy is expected to grow at only about a 3--4 per cent

annual rate over the period, followed by only a modest pick-up in the

first quarter. Banks may initially take a substantial share of the bills

offered in the forthcoming Treasury cash financings, but it is anticipated

that the banks will find it economical to sell them as U.S. Government

deposits are drawn down to finance the budgetary deficit. And more

generally, with bill rates below the Federal funds anddiscount rates,

banks have an incentive to reduce their generally ample liquid asset hold-

ings as loan demands develop. Under alternative C, bank credit expansion

would be somewhat more rapid in the last few weeks of the current quarter,

and considerably larger than under alternative A/B in the first quarter

of next year as growth in M2 accelerates.



-13-

(16) Assuming the tight end of the money market range for

alternative A/B, it is possible that the technical position of markets

will lead to an increase in interest rates over the near-term despite

the recent discount rate reduction. Factors that may put bill rates

under upward pressure have been noted in paragraph (10). In longer-

term markets, dealer and syndicate positions are large in the wake of

the recent Treasury financings and the sizable volume of municipal and

corporate bond offerings; and uncertainties as to the viability of the

announced wage-price program could result in nervous holders pressing

their inventories on the market. An easing on the money market toward

the lower end of the alternative A/B range would likely offset such a

tendency should it arise. And if the money market moved into the

alternative C range, the whole market would likely adjust downward in

yield, impelled in part by expectations of a further decline in the

discount rate.



-14-

Possible directive language

(17) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible use

if the Committee decides to place more emphasis on money market conditions

than on the aggregates and wishes to call for maintenance of the conditions

"that have evolved since the discount rate reduction", subject to a proviso

clause.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to achieve

moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over te months

ahead.] System open market operations until the next meeting of the

Committee shall be conducted with a view to [DEL: achieving bank reserve

and] MAINTAINING THE money market conditions [DEL: consistent with that

objective, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financings.]

that have evolved since the discount rate reduction; provided that

somewhat easier conditions shall be sought if it appears that the

monetary and credit aggregates are falling significantly below

the growth paths expected."

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the

money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as

a description of the conditions to be maintained, and for purposes

of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed

earlier in connection with alternative A as the "expected" paths.

The proviso clause has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against

significant shortfalls but not excesses, on the assumption that the



-15-

Committee would not want money market conditions to be tightened in the

coming period if the aggregates should appear to be expanding on paths

above those projected, which involve no growth over the fourth quarter for

M1 and relatively low growth rates for M2 and the bank credit proxy.

(18) Alternative B. The language for alternative B,

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

achieve moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over

the months ahead. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to

achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with that objective [DEL: , taking account of the forthcoming Treasury

financing]."

is proposed for use if the Committee wishes to continue its emphasis on

monetary aggregates. It could involve the same initial specification as

A, but the reaction to specification misses would be different. For

instance, if the Committee adopts this alternative, it presumably will want

the Desk to be more sensitive to movements away from the paths in the

aggregates and to adjust the Federal funds rate promptly, and perhaps

more aggressively, in response to such deviations. As in alternative A,

the Committee may wish to indicate a greater willingness to countenance

overshoots in the aggregates than shortfalls.

(19) Alternative C. This language differs from that of alternative

B in indicating that the Committee seeks "to promote substantial growth" rather

than "to achieve moderate growth" in the aggregates over the months ahead. It



-16-

is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to pursue the more

aggressive course contemplated by the specifications given earlier for

alternative C.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to PROMOTE SUB-

STANTIAL [DEL: achieve moderate] growth in monetary and credit aggregates

over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that

objective [DEL: , taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing]."
