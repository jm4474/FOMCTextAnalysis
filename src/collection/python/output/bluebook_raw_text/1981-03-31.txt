Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Abstracting from the effect of nationwide NOW accounts, the

decline of transactions balances that characterized the November to February

period appears to have been reversed most recently, with adjusted M-1B

estimated to increase at about an 8-3/4 percent annual rate in March,

as shown in the table below. Nonetheless, M-1B's growth over the first

three months of the year remains about 2-1/4 percentage points below the

Committee's target for that period. The weakness in M-1B is significantly

greater than predicted by the Board's quarterly econometric model as

well as other models, given actual interest rates and nominal GNP. On a

quarterly average basis, adjusted M-1B increasedat only about a 1/2 percent

annual rate, and the income velocity of this aggregate rose at an annual

rate of almost 14-1/2 percent--a record for the period since the Korean war.

-2-

It is possible that the demand for money shifted downwards in response to

extraordinarily high levels of interest rates in the fourth quarter and the

introduction of nationwide NOW accounts in the first, both of which could have

induced the public to review more intensively its cash management techniques.

(2) In contrast to adjusted M-1B, the growth of M-2 is expected

to expand about 2 percentage points above the Committee's December to

March short-run target. The nontransactions component of M-2 was buoyed by

record growth in money market mutual funds (MMMFs), more than offsetting

the greater than expected weakness in small time and savings deposits. In

March, the level of M-2 was at the upper end of the Committee's longer-run

range.

(3) Banks' issuance of large CDs slowed in February and amounts

outstanding have been declining in March as business short-term credit demands

at domestic offices of U.S. banks ebbed. The expansion in total commercial

bank credit moderated considerably in February, and available data suggest

further weakening in March. Growth of large CDs at S&Ls also slowed in the

early months of 1981, even as other deposits weakened, probably reflecting

adverse publicity regarding their earnings problems 1/ Despite the recent

weakness in CDs, M-3 expanded at about a 10-1/4 percent annual rate over the

first three months of the year, placing the level of M-3 in March just above

the upper end of the Committee's longer-run range.

(4) Demand for total reserves weakened in February and the first

weeks of March in response to slow growth in reservable deposits and a drop

in excess reserves to more normal levels following a sustained period in

graded by rating agencies, and investors became more cautious about

uninsured liabilities of thrifts.



which they had been unusually high, presumably in response to the Monetary

Control Act. Borrowing in the first two full weeks in February dropped

to $1.1 billion, below the initial assumption of $1.3 billion used in con-

structing the nonborrowed path, and the funds rate began declining from

the over 17 percent level of early February. By the latter part of February

the funds rate had moved to around the lower end of the 15 to 20 percent

range specified by the Committee. In a telephone conference on February 24,

the Committee agreed to accept some shortfall in the narrow aggregates as

consistent with its objectives for the year, resulting in a reduction in

nonborrowed reserve targets in the latter part of February and early March

that was expected to keep borrowing at the discount window from declining.1/

This path adjustment contributed to a decline in nonborrowed reserves in

February roughly in line with the decline in total reserves, as shown in the

table below. In March nonborrowed reserve growth surged, and borrowings and

the funds rate declined on average from February levels. The federal funds

rate averaged around 13-3/4 percent over the past two statement weeks, but

trading most recently has been in a 14-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent range.

(5) Private short-term interest rates have fallen 2 to 3-1/2

percentage points on balance since the early February Committee meeting, and

with these further declines some are more than 7 percentage points below their

December peaks. In the Treasury bill market, yields have fallen less--3/4 to

2 percentage points since the last meeting and 2 to 4 percentage points since

December-as the Treasury has continued to borrow heavily in the bill market.

In February and March, the Treasury raised more than $20 billion in new

money in bill auctions, including $13 billion in cash management bills

maturing in the second quarter. The bank prime rate was lowered in steps

from 19-1/2 percent at the beginning of February to 17 to 17-1/2 percent.

(6) In contrast to short-term rates, bond yields have risen on

balance since early February-by roughly 30 basis points in the case of

Treasury securities. The Treasury has raised almost $11 billion in note

and bond sales since the mid-quarter financing and next week will auction a

$2-3/4 billion 7-year note. Public issuance of corporate bonds has remained

relatively large. During the intermeeting period, the average commitment

rate on new fixed-rate mortgages at S&Ls rose further to 15.40 percent.

(7) The dollar has fluctuated over a wide range on exchange

markets during the past several weeks, responding primarily to the relative

movement of U.S. and foreign interest rates and to tensions in Eastern

Europe. On balance, the weighted average exchange value of the dollar

has risen 2 percent since the February Committee meeting.

Prospective developments

(9) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative

policy strategies for the second quarter. Since March data for the aggregates

are still partially estimated, the alternatives are specified in terms of the

four-month February to June period (with implied growth rates for March to June

also shown based on the currently projected March levels). The M-1B growth

targets abstract from the estimated impact of nationwide NOW accounts, as does

the Committee's longer-run target. (More detailed and longer-run data for

the aggregates, on both an adjusted and unadjusted basis, including those for

M-1A, are shown in the tables on pp. 8 and 9.) The last line of the table

indicates federal funds rate ranges thought by the staff to be consistent

with the three alternatives.

June to the midpoint growth path of the Committee's QIV '80 to QIV '81

longer-run range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent. Alternative B specifies slower

growth in M-1B that would carry it only to the lower end of the Committee's

longer-run range by June but, assuming a continuation of that growth rate,

to the midpoint of the longer-run range by September. Under either of these

alternatives M-2 would probably be above the upper end of its range in June,

and might well remain above the range over the balance of the year (assuming

M-1B growth at its midpoint rate for the year as a whole). Alternative C is

designed to increase the odds of constraining M-2 growth to within its

longer-run range for 1981. This would appear to involve growth in M-1B.

for the year at the lower end of its longer-run range, and alternative

C specifies such a trajectory for M-1B. The three strategies thus not only

imply options for how rapidly the Committee wishes to target a return of

M-1B to within its longer-run range, but also for the weight it wishes to

place on obtaining an M-2 growth within its own longer-run range.

(11) Demands for transactions balances are likely to expand rapidly

over the second quarter as a whole. Although real GNP in that quarter is

projected to show no change, nominal spending is expected to increase

rather rapidly, and the staff does not anticipate that the sharp downward

shift in money demand of the first quarter will be repeated in the second.

The resulting anticipated strengthening of M-1B will contribute to a rapid

growth in M-2. Though the expansion of the nontransaction component of

M-2 is expected to slow from its exceptionally strong March pace, it will

probably be faster on average over the next three months than in the first

quarter.

(12) The projected strengthening of demand for transactions

balances implies that interest rates will probably be under upward pressure

over the coming quarter, particularly under the alternative B and C speci-

fications, but also possibly to a degree under alternative A. Under

alternative A--which involves growth in total reserves from March to June



-11-

at a 9-3/4 percent annual rate-we would expect the funds rate to be

in a 14 to 16 percent range over the next few-weeks, with borrowing at the

discount window ranging around $1 billion, given the current discount rate

structure. Many market participants appear to be expecting rate declines in

the months ahead. For example, in the futures market, 3-month bills for

June delivery are quoted at 11-7/8 percent, as compared to the current cash

market quote of around 13 percent. Against this backdrop, a failure of the

funds rate to decline from current levels would tend to exert upward pressure

on short-term interest rates generally. Of course, if money demand tends to

be on the weak side this spring-as could well develop if the economy is even

less strong than projected-lower funds rates, borrowing, and market rates

generally would occur.

(13) Whatever upward interest pressures develop over the months

ahead are likely to be mainly the product of constraints on money growth

relative to demand. In the credit markets themselves, funds raised are

expected to drop in the second quarter. This reflects a greater than

seasonal decline in Treasury borrowing, as the combined Federal budget

moves from a $37 billion deficit in the first quarter to an $11 billion

surplus in the second. In the projected interest rate environment, corporate

and tax-exempt bond offerings are unlikely to rise further over the spring

months, although business demands on banks will probably pick up from the

recent depressed pace.

(14) Greater restraint on money growth relative to demand would

be imposed under alternatives B and C, which involve limiting growth in

adjusted M-1B to rates of 6 and 4-1/2 percent, respectively, over the next

three months-substantially lower rates than the 8-3/4 percent of alternative

A. Growth in total reserves over the period would be at annual rates of



-12-

7-3/4 and 6 percent under alternatives B and C, respectively. A federal funds

rate in the area of 15 to 17 percent, or somewhat higher, might emerge over

the next few weeks under alternative B1/. Still greater rate pressures

would develop under alternative C. Borrowing at the discount window might

be around $1-1/2 billion under B and, of course, higher under C. The upward

response of market interest rates, particularly short-term rates, to the

increased pressures on bank reserve positions of alternatives B and C may be

quite marked over the period ahead. Any rise in long-term rates, though,

might be muted as corporate borrowers back away from the market in anticipa-

tion of lower rates later.

(15) From the perspective of the year as a whole, the degree of

rate pressure we would foresee over the next several months under alternative

C, which is consistent with a strategy of lowering M-1B growth for the year

to the bottom of its range, would be likely to weaken the outlook for GNP

relative to the current staff forecast (which is based on alternative B).

As a result, this alternative carries with it a potential for a drop-off of

interest rates from peak levels later in the year, in response to a pro-

nounced cyclical weakening of the economy. By year-end interest rates

under alternative C thus could be lower than under alternative B.

(16) Under any of the alternatives presented, the interest

rate outlook suggests continued substantial earnings pressures on thrift

institutions over the next few months. Thrifts are likely to continue

employing funds to a great extent to acquire short-term assets both to

bolster liquidity and to add to the average return on their assets. They

probably would continue to be reluctant lenders in the mortgage market.

1/ See Appendix II for interest rate projections for 1981 under
alternative B.

Directive language

(17) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at the meeting

in early February. Because monetary aggregates data for the second half

of March are projected, the language calls for expansion of reserve aggre-

gates at a pace consistent with the desired rates of monetary growth over

the four months from February to June. The associated monetary growth

rates on a quarterly average basis are from the fourth quarter of 1980 to

the second quarter of 1981. The specifications adopted at the early

February meeting are shown in strike-through form. For simplification,

the Committee may wish to consider not including M-1A in the directive,

as is shown with strike-through in the paragraph below.

In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth in [DEL: M-1A and] M-1B AND M-2 from

[DEL: December] FEBRUARY to [DEL: March] JUNE at annual rates of ABOUT [DE: 5-to-6]

____ percent and [DEL: in M-2 at a rate of about 8] ____ percent, RESPECT-

IVELY, [DEL: abstracting from] AFTER ALLOWANCE FOR the impact of flows into

NOW accounts. These rates are associated with growth of [DEL: M-1A,] M-1B,

and M-2 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to [DEL: the first quarter] THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 1981 at annual rates of about [DEL: 2 percent 2-3/4]

____ percent, and [DEL: 7] ____ percent, respectively. It is recognized that

shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth

in [DEL: M-1A-and] M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve

paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those dis-

tortions. If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period



-14-

of time, within a range of [DEL: 15 to 20] ____ TO ____ percent are likely

to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths,

the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the

Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.
