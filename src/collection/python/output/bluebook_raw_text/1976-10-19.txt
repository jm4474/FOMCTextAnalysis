through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 remained essentially unchanged in September, but appears

to be increasing at a relatively rapid rate in October. For the two months

combined its growth is now projected at about a 3.5 per cent annual rate,

a shade below the low end of the Committee's 4 to 8 per cent operating

range. However, expansion in bank time and savings deposits other than

money market CD's has been substantially stronger than anticipated during

both September and early October, so that growth in M2 appears to be run-

ning above the mid-point of its range. Deposit inflows at nonbank thrift

institutions have continued at an unusually high rate.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark revi-
sion of monetary aggregates that will be published on Thursday,
October 21. The revisions (based on the March call report) are gen-
erally quite small, however. The level of M1 for each month of this
year was revised up no more than $100 million, and quarterly growth
rates for M1 for the first three quarters of the year hardly changed.
The level of M2 , however, was revised downward more substantially
and its quarterly growth rates were lowered by about 1/2 percentage
point. All tables on subsequent pages of this report (with the excep-
tion of tables 1 and 2 following the charts) are based on the new series.
The new and old series are compared in Appendix Table IV.



(2) Despite expansion of M1 and M2 in the September-October

period, nonborrowed reserves appear to be showing little net change over

2/that time.2/ This divergent behavior in part reflects the effect of lagged

reserve requirements. In addition, total demand deposits at banks (includ-

ing Government and interbank) are declining somewhat on balance, releasing

reserves to support expansion in time and savings deposits.

(3) In the week immediately following the September Committee

meeting, incoming data suggested that growth in M1 and M2 would be well

within the Committee's two-month ranges. Accordingly, the Desk continued

to aim at a Federal funds rate of 5-1/4 per cent. In the following two

statement weeks, however, new data indicated a weakening in demand deposit

flows. As a result, the projected 2-month growth rate for M was lowered

to below Committee's range but M2 remained around the mid-point. The Desk

responded by gradually lowering its Federal funds rate objective to the

5 per cent currently prevailing.

(4) Short-term interest rates have dropped 10 to 35 basis points

since the September Committee meeting, while yields on Treasury issues in

the 2 to 4 year maturity range have dropped 50 basis points. This flatten-

ing of the yield curve in part may reflect market expectations of less

upward interest rate pressure for some time ahead. In the bond area,

yields have declined 5 to 25 basis points over the past four weeks. The

reduced average level of market rates resulted from the easing in money

2/ Appendix A contains a discussion of the actual behavior of nonborrowed
reserves in the weeks between the September and October meetings rela-
tive to the behavior that was expected to be consistent with the Com-
mittee's short-run ranges for monetary growth.

market conditions brought about by Desk operations, from weak M1 data

published for late September, and from widely publicized downward revi-

sions in market forecasts of economic growth over the next several

quarters. The unfavorable economic news has apparently also dampened

enthusiasm in the stock market, resulting in a substantial decline in

stock prices.

age annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over

Prospective developments

(6) Current longer-run growth ranges and three alternatives for

Committee consideration are shown below. In keeping with usual procedures,

the proposed longer-run ranges pertain to the one-year period from QIII

'76 to QIII '77. (The current ranges relate to the QII '76-QII '77 period.)

Current Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

M1  4½-7 5½-8 4½-7 3½-6

M2  7½-9½ 10-12 8½-10½ 7½-9½

M3  9-11 11½-13½ 10-12 8½-10½

Bank credit

proxy 5-8 6½-9½ 5½-8½ 5-8

(7) It appears that the longer-run relationship between M1 and

the other monetary aggregates may be changing from earlier expectations.

From the second to the third quarter of 1976 M1 grew at a 4 per cent annual

rate--somewhat below the lower limit of the FOMC's longer-run range. How-

ever, over that period M2 expanded at about a 9-1/4 per cent annual rate,

close to the upper limit of its longer-run range, and M3 rose at a rate

slightly above the upper end of its range. The staff had expected rela-

tively rapid growth in M2 and M3 in the third quarter. Growth in M1 over

the third quarter was slower than anticipated, however, and interest rates

somewhat lower.

(8) The staff anticipates continued moderation in M growth

relative to M2 and M3. In some part, this reflects an expectation that

shifts from demand to savings deposits will be a little larger than the staff

had earlier anticipated. In addition, in view of the less expansive economy

now projected, market interest rates are expected to be under less upward



-6-

pressure over the next few quarters than previously thought. Therefore,

investors are likely to have a somewhat greater preference than earlier

assumed for time and savings deposits relative to market instruments.

(9) Under the circumstances, the three lettered alternatives

incorporate a different relationship between M1 and the broader aggre-

gates han is contained in the set of longer-run ranges currently in

place. Under alternative C, the growth ranges for the broader monetary

aggregates are about the same as those that now prevail, but the range

for M1 is lower. Alternative B continues the current growth range for

M1, but involves somewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3 . Alternative A--

which contemplates little change in interest rates over the next year--

contains higher ranges for all of the monetary aggregates.1/

(10) Shorter-run specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with the proposed

longer-run alternatives are summarized below. More detailed data--includ-

ing one-year growth rates for the QII '76-QII '77 period as well as for

the QIII '76-QIII '77 period--are shown in the tables on the following

two pages.

1/ Levels of the monetary aggregates for QII '77 implied by growth from
QII '76 at the mid-point of the ranges currently in place relate to
the proposed alternatives in the following way. The implied QII '77
level for M1 is midway between alternatives A and B. For M2 and M3,
the implied levels for QII '77 are best approximated by alternative C,
after taking account of the downward revision in levels associated
with the new benchmark revision.

M2  10-14 9-13 8-12

Federal funds rate 4-5 4½-5½ 5-6
(Inter-meeting period)

(11) Alternative B, which has a Federal funds rate range centered

on 5 per cent, assumes that money market conditions remain unchanged between

now and the next Committee meeting. Growth in M1 under this alternative is

expected to accelerate into a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range

over the October-November period--in large part because of the substantial

increase that has already occurred in early October. Moreover, nominal GNP

is projected to expand at about an 11-1/2 per cent annual rate in the fourth

quarter, up from an 8-1/2 per cent rate in the third, and this should strengthen

transactions demands for money. Growth in M2 is expected to remain quite

large over the 2-month period, reflecting not only the projected rebound in

M1 growth but also the expectation that net inflows into time and savings

deposits (other than money market CD's) will continue large as market inter-

est rates over the next few weeks remain low relative to offering rates on

these deposits.

(12) The staff would still expect interest rates to rise over

the longer run under alternative B, given the projected pace of economic

activity. However, we would now anticipate a Federal funds rate no higher

than about 6 per cent by mid-'77 and perhaps rising to around 6-1/2 per cent

later that year, as may be seen from Appendix Table II. This represents



both more delayed, and less, interest rate pressure than anticipated

earlier. M2 and M3 would, as a result, probably show somewhat more

strength over the longer run relative to M1 than previously expected--

although growth rates in the broader monetary aggregates would, of

course, be expected to slacken over the next few quarters.

(13) Over the next few weeks, interest rates would be likely

to show little net change under alternative B. About $4 billion of pub-

licly-held debt maturing on November 15 will need to be rolled over, and

the Treasury may also take the opportunity to raise about $2-1/2 billion

of new cash. Private credit demands in short-term markets, including

demands at banks, are likely to remain quite moderate over the next few

weeks. With banks expected to receive large inflows of funds from M2

deposits, they probably will permit CD's to run off somewhat further over

the next few weeks and may also be substantial investors in intermediate-

and short-term issues offered in the Treasury refunding. Thus, interest

rates in short- and intermediate-term market sectors are not likely to be

under any pressure from market forces over the period immediately ahead.

However, some upward pressure on private long-term rates may be generated

if the Treasury offers a substantial amount of the new issues in the 10-

year and longer maturity area, given the existing relatively narrow spread

between Treasury and corporate issues and the sizable forward calendar of

corporate and State and local government bonds.

(14) Alternative C involves a rise in the funds rate over the

next few weeks to the 5-1/2 per cent mid-point of a 5-6 per cent range.



-9-

Under those conditions, market interest rates would, of course, rise

between now and the next Committee meeting. The increase might be fairly

sharp since a sizable Treasury financing will be in process and since cur-

rent dealer positions in Treasury securities remain substantial, although

not quite as large as a month ago. Net inflows of funds to banks and

thrift institutions through interest-bearing deposits, particularly savings

deposits, would be constrained somewhat by such a move in the funds rate--

which would probably be accompanied by a rise in the 3-month bill rate back

to near 5-1/2 per cent. However, the net inflows of interest-bearing

deposits would still remain ample, and banks and thrift institutions would

not be likely to tighten non-price lending terms, even though the prime

loan rate, and perhaps mortgage rates, might edge upwards.

(15) Further increases in interest rates can be expected over

the longer-run under alternative C, assuming M1 growth over the QIII '76-

QIII '77 period is constrained to around 4-3/4 per cent. As shown in the

appendix table, a funds rate as high as 7-3/4 per cent might develop by

the fall of 1977.

(16) Alternative A encompasses an easing of the money market

between now and the next Committee meeting. Such an approach seems most

consistent with an effort to raise longer-run growth rates from those cur-

rently in place. The contemplated 1/2 point reduction in the Federal funds

rate in the near-term would lead to a significant decline in market rates--

and also probably in the prime loan and primary mortgage rates--over the

next few weeks. There would be some further increase in net inflows of



-10-

interest-bearing deposits at banks and thrift institutions. As such

inflows continued, and as market rates declined, it is likely that earn-

ings experience would place these institutions under some pressure to

reduce interest rates offered on deposits. However, no substantial

reductions would be likely over the next few weeks.

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in

terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and

are intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

discussed in the preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed

in the event that the Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in

terms of money market conditions and to maintain the conditions now

prevailing.

Alternative "Monetary Aggregates" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

[DEL: moderate] SUBSTANTIAL growth in monetary aggregates over the period

ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

[DEL: moderate] MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

"Money Market" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market condi-

tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in-monetary aggregates] over

the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES

APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

Comparison of Actual and Targeted Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the four-week period ending October 20 with the "targeted" level that

had been thought consistent with the mid-points of the short-run ranges

for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

As can be seen from the table, actual nonborrowed reserves

were $170 million higher than the "targeted" level. Banks held more free

reserves than the staff expected, reflecting a slightly lower level of

borrowing and greater demand for excess reserves by banks than anticipated.

Meanwhile, actual required reserves were about $100 million above expecta-

tions as both the level of deposits, on a lagged basis, subject to reserves

and the average reserve ratio against deposits turned out to be somewhat

higher than expected.

1/ Includes week of October 20, which is partly estimated.



A-2

Total reserves were also higher than expected. But the monetary

base was only slightly above the targeted level, as currency growth was

less than anticipated.

**Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

IOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
*re for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 and 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Colnas 8 and 9 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 11 gives FNMA auction
data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 12 is a 1-day quote for the Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward conmitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are
average net yields to investors on ortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FRA/VA mort-
gages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
