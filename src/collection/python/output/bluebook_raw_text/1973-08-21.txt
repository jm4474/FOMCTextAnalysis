Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) M1 growth was at about a 6 per cent annual rate in July and,

with recent data pointing to a slowdown in August, it appears that for the

July-August target period M 1 expansion will fall somewhat short of the range

of tolerance set by the Committee. Growth in M2 , on the other hand, appears

to be running above the upper end of its target range. The unexpected strength

in M2 reflects a strong consumer response in early August to the higher rates

offered by banks on consumer-type deposits following liberalization of

Regulation Q ceilings.

(2) Growth in RPD over July-August also is expected to be above

the upper limit of the Committee's range of tolerance, as greater than

expected growth in CD's and nondeposit sources added to required reserves.

In addition, the implementation of the hike in required reserves in the

week ended July 25 absorbed more reserves than we had allowed for because

of a misestimation in the deposit mix.

(3) In the two statement weeks following the last FOMC meeting,

incoming data suggested that July-August growth rates in all monetary

aggregates might approach and possibly exceed the upper end of their

respective target ranges. Accordingly, the Desk assumed a more restric-

tive posture in the provision of reserves, and the Federal funds rate

averages for both of these weeks slightly exceeded the 10-1/2 per cent

upper limit of the constraint set by the Committee at its July meeting.

Against this background a majority of Committee members agreed on

August 3 to raise the ceiling for the Federal funds rate to 11 per cent

in order to provide room for maneuver if further restraint on reserve

provision should prove necessary.

(4) Short-term interest rates rose sharply further during most

of the period since the July FOMC meeting in response to high rates on

Federal funds and changed expectations as to the possible severity of

monetary restraint. Rates on large certificates of deposits and banker's

acceptances have paced this general advance, as banks sought funds aggres-

sively in response to continued strong credit demands. Advances in Treasury



-3-

bill rates lagged somewhat behind other short-term rate increases over most of

July but then began catching up in early August, partly in response to the

Treasury's auction of $2.0 billion of September 1973 tax bills and a sizable

offering of short- and intermediate-term securities by the Federal Home Loan

Banks.

(5) Given sharp upward market rate adjustments, the increase in

the discount rate to 7-1/2 per cent on August 13 had little impact on short-

term rates. Market participants generally interpreted the increase as

representing an adjustment to a higher market rate structure rather than a

signal of a further tightening in policy. Indeed, a general credit market

rally began to develop around mid-August and short rates, particularly

Treasury bill rates, declined from recent intermeeting highs. Most recently

the 3-month Treasury bill was trading at around 8.70 per cent bid.

(6) Long-term market interest rates increased substantially after

the July Committee meeting, but late in the period there was a strong bond

market rally. With the combined new issue calendar for corporate and municipal

securities continuing on the light side, the further rise in long-term yields

appeared to reflect mainly a reaction to the sharp rise in short-term rates.

The strong rally in recent days appears to have been based on an attitudinal

shift stemming from good international news and the thought that the monetary

aggregates may be now under control. Moreover, rumors of heavy buying of

Treasury coupon issues arising out of Middle East oil transactions further

bulled the market, given the larger dealer short positions.

(7) The Treasury encountered great difficulty in its mid-August

refunding operation, which involved the auctioning of $4.5 billion in new



-4-

issues to redeem $4.7 billion publicly held issues maturing August 15,

addition to the auction of September tax anticipation bills, the Treasury sold

at auction $2 billion of a reopened, 7-3/4 per cent, 4-year note, and $500

million of a 7-1/2 per cent, 20-year bond. Bidding for both coupon issues

was quite weak, and it was necessary for government accounts to support the

market by buying outstanding securities and by acquiring about one-half of

the bond issue in the auction. Subsequently, however, the market for both

of these coupon issues has improved markedly, and the bond and note are now

about 5 and 2 points respectively above their auction prices.

(8) Mortgage rates also increased further during the inter-

meeting period, with an 8.71 per cent rate set in the latest FNMA mortgage

auction--up 33 basis points since mid-July and 67 basis points since mid-

June. In addition to moving in general sympathy with other long-term rates,

the continued rise in mortgage rates reflects an apparently sharp curtailment

in the extension of commitments by thrift institutions--a cutback generated

by net outflows of deposit funds in the latter part of July and early August.

To meet these deposit outflows and cover the continuing takedowns of out-

standing loan commitments, savings and loan associations have been borrowing

heavily from their Federal Home Loan Banks in recent weeks, and the FHLB

System in turn has raised a large volume of funds in the market for payment

later this month. Under the circumstances, both savings and loan and FHLB

System liquidity has declined, and mutual savings banks are reported to have

been liquidating securities and drawing on outstanding lines of credit at

commercial banks.

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time periods.

A new Appendix table III shows quarterly growth rates for money supply

calculated in two ways--by comparing average levels for all three months

growth rate have been changed to reflect the behavior of time deposits

following the early July changes in Regulation Q ceiling rates. In addition,

the funds rate ranges associated with the three alternatives have also been

raised somewhat, reflecting in part the upward revisions in projected nominal

GNP.

(12) The recent sharp rise in short-term interest rates will be

limiting money demand in the months ahead. As a result, even though growth

in nominal GNP is expected to remain substantial, M1 may expand at a rela-

tively slow pace between now and year-end, given prevailing money market

conditions. For alternative B, a 9-1/2--11-1/2 per cent Federal funds rate

range is shown. This range is symmetrical around current money market con-

ditions. Staff judgment and model forecasts suggest that the odds are better

than even that some decline in the funds rate will develop if the alternative

B targets for the aggregates are pursued, given the degree of restraint

already built into the system.

(13) In the August-September period M1 growth under alternative B

is indicated to be in a 2--4 per cent annual rate range. A particularly low

growth rate is shown for August, reflecting in part drawdowns in cash balances

for investment in higher yielding time deposits, especially the newly avail-

able, widely advertised long-term savings certificates. However, such a one-

time stock adjustment is likely to be short-lived in its effects on cash

balances mainly held for transactions purposes or for normal financial market

operations.



-9-

(14) Under alternative B, over the next two months, M2 expansion

in a 7-3/4--9-3/4 per cent annual rate range is indicated. The faster in-

crease in M2 relative to M1 results mainly from the initial sizable movement

into consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks in the wake of the

regulatory changes. The initial inflow probably reflected not only some

movement out of demand deposits but, more importantly, shifts of funds from

nonbank thrift institutions. We have assumed a gradual phasing out of

transfers from thrift institutions to banks, though we do not expect it to

subside as promptly as transfers out of demand deposits because of the

maturity distribution of thrift institution deposits and a certain inertia

in shifting deposits from one institution to another. On balance, a con-

siderably more moderate rise in consumer type time deposits is expected in

September than in August, and a further tapering appears in prospect for the

fourth quarter.

(15) Growth of M3 in the August-September period--at around

5-1/2--7-1/2 per cent annual rate--is expected to be more moderate than

in M2, since the shift in funds from thrift institutions to banks raise the

M2 figures relative to M3 . By the fourth quarter, we would expect most of

this divergence to disappear, and growth rates of consumer-type time and

savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions are both projected at

around 7 per cent.

(16) Looking to all three money concepts, by the fourth quarter M1

is indicated to be expanding at a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate under alternative B,

while M2 and M3 growth is expected to be around 5-1/2 and 6 per cent,

respectively. For M2 and M3, these would be lowest quarterly growth rates

since early 1970.



-10-

(17) The aggregates are specified to show less growth under

alternative C and more under alternative A. Under alternative C, the

funds rate is expected to rise into the upper part of a 10 to 12-1/2

per cent range between now and mid-September. The wider range specified

under this alternative reflects what we presume to be an icreasing diffi-

culty in forcing the public to further economize on cash holdings at a

time when interest rates have already increased to historically high levels.

Under alternative A, we would expect the funds rate to drop between now and the

next meeting, though perhaps not to the bottom of the indicated range.

(18) Other key assumptions in the monetary relationships pre-

sented are: (a) continued strength in business loan demand on banks;

(b) some reduction in demand for consumer and mortgage credit; (c) con-

tinued active demand by banks for large CD funds, though perhaps less

aggressive demand than in the past four months taken as a whole;

(d) greater bank reluctance to participate in the securities market, par-

ticularly under alternative C, in view of the wide spread of their bor-

rowing costs over their return on portfolio. On balance, bank credit--as

measured by the proxy--is expected to rise by around a 15--16 per cent

annual rate in the August-September period, buoyed in part by a projected

rise in U.S. Treasury deposits at commercial banks. Growth is likely to be

considerably less rapid in the fourth quarter as credit demands fade some-

what, inflows of consumer-type time deposits abate, and Treasury deposits

at banks decline.



-11-

(19) Most short-term rates appear to have adjusted to a 10-1/2

per cent funds rate. The 3-month Treasury bill rate was low relative to the

funds rate during the inter-meeting period, and the recent market rally has

carried it even lower. Some upward movement in the bill rate from recent

levels can be expected if money market conditions remain taut, in sympathy

with continued strong demands in the short-term area by banks, business, and

Federal agencies. In addition, the bill market could be particularly affected

if foreign central banks sell bills in the market or liquidate Treasury specials

in financing a return flow of funds to the U.S.

(20) Given the still wide spread of short- over long- rates, it

would appear that the recent market rally may have carried long rates lower

than is sustainable. However, market participants are now especially sensitive

to clues regarding System policy, and long-term rates could decline further if

the market comes to believe that the aggregates are under control and monetary

restraint has peaked. With the market as sensitive as it is, a significant

move in the funds rate in either a tightening or easing direction is likely

to be accompanied by prompt and rather sizable sympathetic adjustments in other

interest rates.



-12-

Proposed directive

(21) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the reference

to international developments in light of the recent strong recovery of

the dollar. Retention of the reference to domestic financial developments

is proposed only for alternative C, the one alternative that contemplates

a significant tightening of the money market. As will be noted, all three

alternatives refer to growth rates in the aggregates "thus far this year."

For the period through July, these are as follows: M1, 6 per cent; M2,

7-1/2 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 13-1/2 per cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of internationl

and domesticate financial market developments and the forthcoming Treasury

financing,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money mar-

ket conditions consistent with SOMEWHAT slower growth in monetary

aggregates over the months immediately ahead than HAS occurred on

average [DEL: in the first half of the] THUS FAR THIS year.



Alternative B

To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of international

and domesticate financial market developments and the forthcoming

Treasury financing,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions consistent with slower growth in

monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead than HAS

occurred on average [DEL: in the first half of the] THUS FAR THIS year.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: international]

and domestic financial market developments [DEL: and the forthcoming

Treasury financing,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions consistent with SIGNIFICANTLY slower growth

in monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead than HAS

occurred on average [DEL: in the first half of the] THUS FAR THIS year.

Notes: Government Security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agree-
ments maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt
issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Fed-
eral funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday
figures.

**Beginning with January 1973, monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
