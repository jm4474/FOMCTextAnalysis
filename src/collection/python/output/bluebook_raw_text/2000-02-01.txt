MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In the days immediately after the December FOMC meeting, the Trading

Desk continued to conduct a large volume of open market operations, particularly forward

and term repurchase agreements, that brought total repurchase agreements outstanding to

$141 billion by the end of the year. These operations were necessary to offset reserve drains

induced by buildups in currency in circulation, the Treasury's balance at the Federal Reserve,

and the pool of temporary investment orders from foreign central banks. On several days

before year-end, the federal funds rate was below target when the Desk entered the market,

leading some observers to conjecture that the Federal Reserve was "flooding the market with

liquidity" as insurance against potential Y2K problems. On these days, the funds rate tended

to firm in late trading when aggregate reserve supply proved to be less plentiful than market

participants had thought. Since the turn of the year, a bit more than three-quarters of the

Y2K bulge in currency has flowed back to the Federal Reserve and other factors have

returned to more typical levels. The Desk mopped up these additions to reserves by allowing

repurchase agreements to mature without replacement and by arranging several matched

sale-purchase transactions. Operating balances reached very low levels on some days, and

funds rate volatility was elevated, but, in general, the effective rate has been close to the

target since the turn of the year.1 Borrowing from the Special Liquidity Facility was

1. Over the entire intermeeting period, the effective funds rate averaged 5.29 percent.

substantial on only two days over the intermeeting period, and none of the options auctioned

under the Special Financing Facility was exercised. In general, financial markets weathered

the turn of the year well, reflecting in part the cumulative effect of Federal Reserve initiatives

to stave off potential Y2K dislocations. Although the RP rate on Treasury collateral dipped

well below the funds rate and bid-asked spreads in the RP and funds market spiked around

year-end, they quickly returned to more normal configurations. Activity in the markets for

Treasury and corporate securities dropped as year-end approached and subsequently

recovered, but the magnitude of the swings did not differ much from other year-end periods.

(2) Market participants generally anticipated both the FOMC's decision at the

December meeting to leave the stance of policy unchanged and the announcement's

implication that the Committee would be inclined to tighten in February; hence, yields on

coupon securities showed little change that day. Against the background of the Federal

Reserve's expression of concern about the unsustainable pace of economic expansion and

the uneventful passing of the century date change, evidence that aggregate demand retained

considerable momentum pressured market interest rates higher over most of the

intermeeting period. Today, after publication of unexpectedly high readings on

compensation and GDP inflation, most Treasury yields initially rose and private security

prices tumbled. However, as risk spreads widened, the dollar strengthened, and equity prices

fell, something of a flight to quality ensued and Treasury yields reversed course. On balance,

yields on Treasury notes have risen 30 to 40 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, while

the yield on the thirty-year bond is unchanged, and the yield curve now slopes downward

past the five-year maturity. Expectations of changes in relative supplies associated with

agency issuance and the Treasury buyback program and technical factors relating to efforts to

rebalance portfolios contributed to the pivoting of the yield curve. Even with today's

widening of risk spreads, yields on investment grade corporate bonds rose less than Treasury

yields, especially after market participants saw that the century date change had passed

without serious dislocations. Most risk spreads have now more than reversed their runup

last summer, though they generally remain well above their levels prior to autumn of 1998. 2

Stock prices were quite volatile over the intermeeting period, with tech stocks and other

shares often exhibiting disparate movements day-by-day. Reflecting the countervailing

influences of stronger-than-expected earnings but generally rising interest rates, broad stock

price indexes fell slightly on balance while tech-heavy indexes rose sharply.

(3) The foreign exchange value of the dollar had shown little net change over the

intermeeting period against indexes of both major foreign currencies and those of other

important trading partners. Today, however, the dollar appreciated 1-1/2 percent against

major foreign currencies, as expectations built for more substantial Federal Reserve

tightening. On net over the intermeeting period, the dollar gained 4-1/4 percent against the

yen and 3 percent relative to the euro, but it depreciated around 1 percent vis-a-vis the

British pound and 2 percent against the Canadian dollar. Long-term interest rates in

industrial countries-with the notable exception of Japan-rose appreciably, boosted by

evidence that the economic expansion in Europe had found firmer footing. Against that

backdrop, market participants became increasingly confident that policy tightening would be

forthcoming. Indeed, judging by money market futures, expectations are for official rate

hikes by the European Central Bank of about 1 percentage point over the next year, only a

little less than for the United States. The Bank of England actually tightened, citing

concerns about inflation pressures as justification for a 1/4 percentage point increase in its

repurchase rate on January 13. In Japan, in sharp contrast, market participants apparently

saw little news in recent weeks to lead them to believe that the Bank of Japan will change its

zero-interest-rate policy any time soon as economic recovery there continues to proceed in

fits and starts. Japanese long-term yields edged lower over the intermeeting period,

supporting the dollar. Japanese monetary authorities intervened to weaken the yen on two

days early in the period.

; U.S. monetary authorities

did not intervene. Financial market conditions in emerging market economies generally

improved further over the intermeeting period, with sovereign debt spreads narrowing and

equity prices rising.

(4) M2 growth rose to a 7-1/4 percent annual rate in December and edged up

further to an 8-1/4 percent pace in January.3 Growth over the two months was above that

expected at the time of the December Committee meeting. Extra demands for liquidity and

safety may have added a little to M2 growth in December and, through the monthly

averaging process, to January as well. However, there were more substantial, though largely

offsetting, influences on M2 components. Currency in the hands of the public expanded

rapidly in the second half of December, and, as depositors exchanged money in the bank for

money in their pockets, liquid deposits in M2 weakened. In January, the public ran down its

currency holdings, but at a gradual rate, and liquid deposits have rebounded in recent weeks.

(5) M3 was more affected by Y2K positioning than M2. Issuance of large time

deposits exploded in the fourth quarter of 1999 for several reasons: Banks wanted to build

up their liquid assets, many faced very high credit demands that needed to be funded, and

institutional depositors saw banks as safe harbors in which to ride out the century date

change. In addition, institutional money funds surged because firms viewed them as

convenient parking places for some of their extra precautionary liquid balances. Overall, M3

growth reached an annual rate of 16-1/2 percent in December. A pronounced deceleration

in large time deposits helped bring the growth of M3 in January down to 8-3/4 percent.

Banks have seen demands for credit ease considerably in January, especially in the

components (business and security loans) most likely to have been affected by Y2K.4

(6) Total domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown 6-1/4 percent in

the fourth quarter of 1999, including a growth rate of 7 percent in December. To some

4. Responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Survey suggest that the buildup in
security loans in late 1999 was the result of securities dealers turning to banks as the cost of
issuing commercial paper climbed and as other institutional lenders pulled back from this
market temporarily. For business loans, respondent banks tended to downweight Y2K as a
reason for the strength late last year, referring instead to merger and acquisition financing
and investment expenditures.



-6-

extent, borrowing was boosted late in the year by desires to build liquid assets. This was

clearly the case for the federal sector, as the runoff in debt came to a temporary halt in

December to allow the Treasury to build up its cash balance. Paydowns resumed in January

and included the redemption of $54 billion in cash management bills. Nonfederal debt is

estimated to have increased at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in December, in line with its rate

of growth over the second half of 1999. Thus far this year, nonfinancial businesses have

returned to credit markets albeit somewhat tentatively to bond markets, as issuers have

pulled back in response to the rise in bond yields. Households appear to have taken on

consumer debt at a more rapid pace in December, in line with reports of exceptionally strong

holiday sales, and commercial bank data for January indicate that consumer loans are still

expanding briskly. Home mortgage debt apparently has continued to grow rapidly in recent

months despite an increase of more than a percentage point in mortgage interest rates over

the past year. Responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Survey, however, provided

some evidence of slowing demand for home mortgages.

Longer-Term Strategies

(7) This section considers alternative longer-term strategies for monetary policy

and examines some aspects of conducting monetary policy in a setting of elevated

uncertainty about the supply side of the economy.

(8) The first set of scenarios, presented in Chart 3, starts with a baseline that

judgmentally extends the Greenbook forecast. Then, the FRB/US model is used to

examine policies designed to achieve alternative rates of inflation over the longer run.5 On

the supply side of the economy, in all three scenarios the long-run NAIRU is about 5-1/4

percent and growth of potential output is initially around 4 percent, as in the Greenbook.

However, labor productivity growth begins to slow at mid-decade as the pace of capital

accumulation (and the rate of increase in services that capital provides) moderates.6

(9) Among the factors affecting aggregate demand, the federal budget surplus as a

percent of nominal GDP is assumed to decline slowly on a NIPA basis from a peak of a bit

5. In the version of the model used for these simulations, expectations of inflation and
other variables are formed in a forward-looking manner, but with incomplete knowledge of
the structure of the model. Under this expectational mechanism, the model has a long-run
sacrifice ratio of about 3-3/4. That is, the equivalent of a 3-3/4 percentage point increase in
the unemployment rate sustained over a year would eventually yield a 1 percentage point
lower rate of inflation.

6. The standard growth theory embodied in the staff model implies that the long-run
sustainable growth rate of the capital stock depends on the growth rates of three
factors-the working-age population, total factor productivity, and the relative price of
capital goods. The capital stock, in turn, provides a flow of capital services that helps to
determine labor productivity. Extrapolating recent trends of the key factors implies that
growth in capital services is likely to slow from the 7 percent rate projected for the near term
to a figure closer to 5 percent in the long run.

less than 2-1/2 percent next year to about 1-1/2 percent at the end of the decade.7

Household demand is affected importantly by a projected decrease in the ratio of household

wealth to GDP. In part, this occurs because the personal saving rate is currently too low to

maintain wealth-to-income ratios absent rising asset prices. In addition, the value of

corporate equity falls relative to GDP owing to higher real interest rates, slowing

productivity growth, and a decline in the profit share of output. Ultimately, as household

wealth declines relative to income, the personal saving rate rebounds to 4 percent by the end

of the decade. Growth of foreign activity is about in line with that of the U.S. economy.

Because the income elasticity of imports in the United States is much higher than in its

trading partners, the U.S. current account deficit would continue to widen without

significant dollar depreciation. As a result, portfolio balance considerations are assumed to

lead to a modest secular depreciation of the real foreign exchange value of the dollar over

the remainder of the decade, at about the same annual rate built into the Greenbook for

2001. This depreciation damps but does not halt the widening of the deficit.

(10) Although dollar depreciation and the decline in the federal budget surplus put

upward pressure on equilibrium interest rates, those effects are more than offset by a rising

personal saving rate and slowing productivity growth in the last half of the decade. Over

the next few years, however, the equilibrium rate remains at an exceptionally high level,

7. Given the prospects for productivity growth embodied in the baseline, this path for
declining government saving seems reasonable in that it is consistent with both eliminating
the federal debt early in the next decade, in line with the Administration's announced goals,
and addressing concerns about the long-range financing of Social Security.



-10-

having been elevated by the acceleration in productivity and wealth-induced declines in the

saving rate in recent years.

(11) In the baseline scenario, shown by the solid lines in Chart 3, core PCE

inflation continues to rise beyond the Greenbook horizon, as the unemployment rate is a

percentage point below the NAIRU at the beginning of 2002. The Committee is assumed

to lean against this upward drift in inflation by tightening policy further to slowly push the

unemployment rate up to the NAIRU by mid-decade. This policy entails raising the

nominal federal funds rate to 8 percent by the end of 2004, an action that pushes the real

funds rate up to 5-1/4 percent-a little beyond the 5 percent equilibrium real rate.8

Consequently, the unemployment rate increases to the NAIRU in 2006, allowing inflation to

stabilize at just under 3 percent.

(12) In the stable inflation scenario, shown by the dot-dashed lines, the

Committee seeks to maintain core PCE inflation close to its current rate of 2 percent.

Continuing to increase the funds rate in 2001 by almost a further percentage point-rather

than leaving it unchanged, as in the Greenbook forecast-accomplishes this objective. This

preemptive action raises the real rate and weakens aggregate spending enough to boost the

unemployment rate somewhat above the long-run NAIRU. Such slack is needed for a while

to offset the inflationary impetus of the initial leveling off, and later moderation, in

productivity growth.

8. In the charts, inflation is measured by the four-quarter change in the core PCE chain-
weight price index, and past movements in this index are used to proxy for inflation
expectations in the calculations of the real federal funds rate.



-11 -

(13) The price stability scenario, shown by the dotted lines, brings core PCE

inflation down to 3/4 percent - close to the estimated measurement bias in this price index.

To achieve price stability, the Committee is seen to start raising the nominal funds rate

immediately, to a peak of about 7-3/4 percent by late next year. This policy yields a much

steeper and higher trajectory of real interest rates, pushing the unemployment rate up to

6-1/2 percent by the middle of the decade. Although GDP growth slows to below trend,

the economy does not come close to falling into recession in this scenario; the faster growth

of potential that has developed in recent years means that a substantial rise in the

unemployment rate can occur even with a significantly positive pace of economic

expansion. As inflation approaches its target, policy eases and real interest rates drift back

down to their equilibrium level, leading to a drift down in unemployment back to the

NAIRU.

(14) In the stable-inflation and price-stability scenarios, the Committee is assumed

to choose a smooth trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate that minimizes the squared

deviations of the expected paths of future inflation from its target rate and of

unemployment from the NAIRU. In this process, the current funds rate is set based on

estimates of the NAIRU and productivity growth going forward (as well as on forecasts of

other factors). However, given the experience of the past several years, both of these

supply-side estimates are subject to outsized uncertainty. The Committee might respond to

this heightened uncertainty by placing less emphasis on forecasts and by downweighting the

importance of economic indicators whose interpretation is contingent on knowledge of the

NAIRU or trend productivity growth.



-12-

(15) Chart 4 shows that under the circumstances portrayed in the Greenbook, a

policy looking only at recent inflation developments can do reasonably well at stabilizing the

economy, although not as well as one using forecasts of economic conditions based on

accurate assessments of the supply side. With the realized-inflation rule (shown by the

dotted lines), the Committee is seen as changing the nominal federal funds rate in response

to the realized change in inflation and to deviations of current inflation from a long-run

target of 2 percent.9 The forecast-based strategy (the solid lines) is the same as the "stable

inflation" scenario of Chart 3, and is re-labeled to highlight its dependence on forecasts of

future conditions that in addition are assumed to be accurate. Because under the realized-

inflation rule the policymaker does not use as much information about the state of the

economy, that rule produces greater fluctuations in inflation and unemployment, but the

differences are contained and do not persist. To do even this well, however, the funds rate

must react very strongly to inflation data. In the rule shown, the nominal funds rate is more

than twice as sensitive in the short run to a change in inflation as it is in the standard Taylor

rule.

(16) It is also useful to examine how such a strategy performs in a variety of

situations in which developments do not conform with expectations. Charts 5, 6, and 7

9. Specifically, the funds rate is set according to the rule Ar = 3 At , + .2 (7r - 7t*), where
Ar is the quarterly change in the nominal funds rate, 71 is the four-quarter rate of core PCE
price inflation, and 7I* is the target rate of inflation. The change in the inflation rate is
included in the rule so that, for example, when inflation is above target and rising the
nominal funds rate will rise by more than if inflation were at the same level but falling.
Unlike the Taylor rule, this rule determines the change in, not the level of, the federal funds
rate-a feature that frees the policymaker from needing to know the real equilibrium funds
rate.

compare the behavior of the economy in three such situations under the realized-inflation

rule and under the Taylor rule. The Taylor rule also relies on current inflation data, but in

addition includes responses to the perceived current value of the output gap and the

estimated equilibrium real interest rate.

(17) Chart 5 portrays a situation in which the current NAIRU is, and for some

time has been, 4 percent. A policymaker who knew the true values of the NAIRU and

potential GDP could do quite well by responding to movements in both output and

inflation, as indicated by the solid lines showing the performance of the Taylor rule without

measurement error. In contrast, the dot-dashed lines illustrate a situation in which the

policymaker incorrectly estimates the NAIRU to be 5-1/4 percent, but gradually lowers this

estimate to 4 percent as inflation persistently comes in below expectations.10 Initially, owing

to the misestimation of the NAIRU, the policymaker tightens inappropriately to raise real

interest rates and unemployment to their perceived equilibrium levels. The resultant

overshoot in unemployment and undershoot in inflation is only slowly eliminated. As

indicated by the dotted line, the realized-inflation rule also would prescribe a substantial

increase in the funds rate this year, because of the 1/2 percentage point pickup in core

inflation. However, as time passes and inflation declines, responding to actual inflation

would lead to a fairly prompt reversal of policy, and the unemployment rate could thereby

be kept much closer to 4 percent and inflation held more tightly in the vicinity of 2 percent

compared to the Taylor rule with error.

10. Such a policymaker also would begin with an estimate of the equilibrium real funds
rate that is too high. As with the NAIRU, the estimated equilibrium real rate would be
revised down over time as inflation came in lower than expected.



-14-

(18) Aside from questions about the sustainable level of unemployment, the

Committee also must wrestle with how best to discern and respond to changes in potential

growth. Chart 6 considers a situation in which productivity growth turns out to be a

percentage point faster than the staffs projection; results are reported as deviations from

the baseline scenario of Chart 3, in order to better illustrate the effects of the productivity

surprise. The realized-inflation rule (the dotted lines) allows the gains of the productivity

acceleration to be taken in the form of lower unemployment for several years. With time,

however, tighter labor market conditions cause inflation to begin to rise, and these

developments lead in turn to higher interest rates." By contrast, when policy is based on

the Taylor rule and the increase in productivity growth is perceived only gradually (the solid

lines), policymakers misjudge the inflation implications of the strength in aggregate demand

spurred by the higher growth of productivity and they raise the funds rate more quickly

(particularly in real terms). The Taylor rule causes the initial productivity surprise to

primarily lower inflation rather than the unemployment rate. Only as policymakers gradually

learn that the acceleration in productivity is permanent and adjust their estimates of the

output gap are they able to bring inflation back to its desired level.12 ,13

11. According to a wide variety of models, an increase in the trend growth rate of the
economy eventually leads to an upward shift in the equilibrium real interest rate. This shift is
greater than one-for-one in the FRB/US model; the exact magnitude of the shift depends on
a variety of factors, including the response of government spending to the change in
potential output, and the degree to which foreign economies also experience a pick-up in
growth.

12. Thus, targeting only inflation, and not also the deviation of output from potential (or
unemployment from the NAIRU) looks attractive in the case of a beneficial supply shock.
With an adverse supply shock, targeting inflation would cause the shock to have more of its
effect on lowering output, relative to a rule that tried to stabilize both inflation and



-15-

(19) Of course, not all the uncertainty about the outlook concerns the supply side;

the Committee is also likely to face swings in aggregate demand not associated with

productivity shocks. In Chart 7, we consider a gradual but prolonged slide in the stock

market.14 As indicated by the dotted lines, the realized-inflation rule does not lead to as

quick a response of interest rates to the downturn in aggregate demand as does the Taylor

rule; instead, policymakers wait until the weakness in output shows up as lower inflation.

As a result, unemployment rises almost a percentage point relative to baseline, leading to a

shortfall of inflation with respect to the target rate. By contrast, the Taylor rule (the solid

lines) prompts a response to the weakness in output, and therefore more quickly stabilizes

both unemployment and inflation.

output-such as the Taylor rule.

13. Despite the length of time required for policymakers to gauge fully the extent of the
productivity acceleration (seven years), errors in the measurement of the output gap are
relatively small, and peak at less than 3 percentage points.

14. The shock is a 2 percentage point rise in the equity premium, spread over this year
and next. On an ex ante basis, such a shock would produce a 40 percent decline in equity
prices. However, associated changes in the long-run level of real interest rates reduce the ex
post fall in the stock market to 25 percent.

Projections and Ranges for Money and Debt

(20) The growth rates of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1999 and projected

for 2000 are shown in the table below, along with those for nominal GDP. A discussion of

alternative ranges for money and debt growth in 2000 begins in paragraph 25.

(21) M2 grew 6-1/4 percent over 1999, and its velocity declined slightly. Although

M2 velocity tracked the rise in its opportunity cost rather well over the second half of the

year, as shown in chart 8, that conformance with historical relationships followed a period

when movements in velocity were not so readily explained. From the end of 1995 through

mid-1999, velocity rose and then declined, despite rather stable opportunity costs. The

demand for M2 assets over that period is not fully understood, but we believe that it was

importantly affected by interactions with household stock market investments. Increases in

velocity up to mid-1997 were associated with strong flows into stock mutual funds,

suggesting substitution of equity investments for M2 assets. As capital gains boosted stock

market wealth over the next two years, however, flows into stock mutual funds slowed

noticeably, and M2 strengthened relative to income, perhaps reflecting some portfolio

rebalancing by households.15 Whatever the causes, as shown in the lower panel, those

departures of velocity from what would be predicted by opportunity costs are much smaller

than in the early 1990s. As regards M3, growth for the year came to 7-1/2 percent boosted

to some extent by a Y2K-related surge in institutional money funds and large time deposits.

(22) M2 growth is expected to moderate substantially in 2000--to 4-3/4percent--

despite projected growth of nominal GDP remaining at about 6 percent. The slowing in

M2 growth owes importantly to the staffs assumption of an increase in the federal funds

rate of 1-1/4 percentage point over this year, which should help to induce a rise in M2 velocity

of about 1-1/4 percent. The increase in M2 is a little more than would be predicted by

historical relationships between opportunity costs and velocity; the forecast assumes a little

support for M2 demand owing to disappointing returns for investors in the stock market

this year, which could prompt some shifts to M2 assets.

(23) M3 is expected to decelerate more than M2 and post 6-1/4 percent growth in

2000, reflecting in part the unwinding of the Y2K effects on the broader aggregate. In

particular, the growth of institutional money funds should slow substantially as the buildup

of corporate liquidity in late 1999 dissipates and as investors find yields on market

instruments to be more attractive than the lagging returns on such funds. Managed

liabilities of banks in M3 should grow more slowly this year as well, as banks pare back the

extraordinary Y2K-related pace of issuance of the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, despite

some increase in real interest rates and a slightly more conservative lending stance by banks

and other depositories, bank lending is expected to pick up markedly this year, contributing

to the faster growth of M3 than of GDP.

(24) After growing 6-1/2 percent in 1999, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors

is projected to increase 5-1/4 percent this year, somewhat below the anticipated growth of

nominal GDP. Only a small portion of the deceleration owes to the unwinding of extra

borrowing late in 1999 associated with Y2K. More fundamentally, rising government

surpluses induce faster paydowns of Treasury debt, and some moderation in private

spending slows nonfederal debt growth to a still rapid 8-1/4 percent. Moreover, both equity

retirements and the accumulation of liquid assets held by businesses are projected to

moderate from their rapid rates of increase in 1999, holding down business credit demands.

Offsetting these influences in part is the widening gap between capital expenditures and

internal funds, as investment remains strong while profit growth slows. Household debt

growth is expected to ease somewhat after its surge toward the end of 1999, as spending on

big ticket items is restrained by higher interest rates and lower realized returns on equity

investments. While banks may tighten up a bit further on lending terms and conditions,

credit costs to private borrowers are unlikely to rise by much more than benchmark yields.

Ranges for Money and Debt

(25) The ranges for money and debt in 2000 that the Committee selected on a

provisional basis last July are presented below, along with an alternative that adjusts the

money ranges for faster growth of potential GDP. As in other recent years, the Committee

chose provisional ranges for the monetary aggregates in 2000 that it saw as benchmarks for



-19-

money growth under conditions of long-term price stability and historically typical velocity

trends, while the range for domestic nonfinancial debt was better aligned with projected

growth of that aggregate in 2000. The provisional range for debt, at 3 to 7 percent, is

centered not far from the staff's projection for debt growth in 2000, and therefore no

alternative setting for that range is offered for consideration. 16 The provisional ranges, listed

as alternative I, are the same set that has been in place since the middle of 1995. The

Committee may wish once again to retain these ranges as an implicit indication to the public

of the low weight it places on the monetary and debt aggregates in formulating monetary

policy. The existing ranges might also be chosen if the increases in productivity observed in

recent years were seen as likely to be transitory.

Alternative Ranges for Money and Debt in 2000

Memo:
Alt. I Projected

Provisional Alt. II Growth

M2 1 to 5 2 to 6 4-3/4

M3 2 to 6 3 to 7 6-1/4

Debt 3 to 7 3 to 7 5-1/4

16. If the Committee chose to reinterpret the range for debt as a price stability range,
parallel with the treatment for the monetary ranges, it would have several choices, depending
on how it interpreted history. It could set a range for debt that was about a percentage point
faster than its expected growth of nominal GDP at price stability, reflecting the decline in
debt velocity on balance since 1959. However, debt velocity has been rather flat outside of
the 1980s, so a price stability range for the debt aggregate could alternatively be centered on
the expected steady state growth of nominal GDP, as is the case for M2.



-20-

(26) If, however, the faster productivity growth of recent years is expected to

persist or even pick up further, the ranges in use since the mid-1990s would no longer be

centered around money growth expected when prices were stable. In alternative II, the

ranges for M2 and M3 are adjusted upward to allow for faster growth of potential output.

When the Committee shifted to using price stability ranges in the mid-1990s, the staffs

estimate of potential output growth was about 2-1/4 percent and there was thought to be

perhaps a percentage point of upward bias in the implicit GDP deflator. Over the last four

years, however, the staff estimates that potential GDP growth has averaged about 3-1/2

percent, while the bias in the implicit deflator is now about 1/2 percentage point. Potential

GDP growth is deduced from estimates of structural productivity growth averaging 2-1/2

percent, plus about 1 percent growth in labor inputs.17,18 The midpoints of the ranges in

alternative II are consistent with these estimates of recent potential output growth and

residual bias in the implicit GDP deflator, assuming historically typical velocity behavior.

With stable velocity, M2 would be expected to grow at the implied 4 percent pace of

17. While actual nonfarm business productivity has grown at an average 2-3/4 percent rate
over the last four years, about 1/4 percentage point has been cyclical, according to staff
estimates. Differences in the growth rates of output and hours in the nonfarm business
sector versus the overall economy require a downward adjustment of 0.1 percentage point in
arriving at potential GDP growth.

18. Similar estimates for potential GDP expansion over the last four years can be
derived using Okun's law: Actual GDP has grown an average 4-1/4 percent and the
unemployment rate has fallen 0.4 percentage point per annum on balance since 1996.
Estimates of Okun's law over recent decades imply that the difference between actual and
potential output growth is twice the rate of decline in the unemployment rate, or 3/4
percentage point, implying potential output growth of 3-1/2 percent over the period.



-21-

nominal GDP. The range for M3 would be a percentage point higher than that for M2,

reflecting the faster average growth of the broader aggregate over history. 19

(27) For a variety of reasons, however, desired steady state growth of the monetary

aggregates might be faster than the midpoints of the ranges in alternative II. The staff

estimates that, owing to accelerating productivity, the growth of potential GDP will be yet

more elevated going forward--4 percent over this year and next. Moreover, the Committee

may believe that a small positive true inflation rate is desirable in the long run because of

possible nominal rigidities in the economy or because of potential risks to the ability of

policy to react forcefully to economic weakness if the nominal federal funds rate were close

to the lower bound of zero.20 The Committee may view a small positive true inflation rate

as still consistent with effective price stability in that such a rate may be sufficiently low as to

have no influence on the decision-making of households and businesses. If the Committee

did decide to adjust the monetary ranges up by a percentage point or more, the Humphrey

Hawkins report and testimony could clarify that no greater weight was intended to be placed

on the aggregates in the formulation of policy. The July 1999 Humphrey Hawkins report

noted that such an adjustment might be needed if faster productivity growth persisted.

19. The velocity of M3 has been rather unstable and its long-run trend difficult to assess
(chart 7). M3 has grown faster than M2 on average since 1959; this divergence has been
evident in recent years as well and is projected to continue over the forecast period.
However, it is unclear why nominal magnitudes would grow at divergent rates over the very
long run, and the price stability range for M3 might ultimately have to be aligned to that for
M2.

20. This latter concern may have become less of a risk of late because of apparent
increases in the equilibrium real funds rate, likely associated with faster productivity growth.



-22-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(28) In view of continued and surprising vigor in incoming spending data and a

slightly higher projected path for equity prices, the staff has again notched up its assessment

of the underlying strength of aggregate demand. At the same time, the forecasts for

productivity growth and expansion of potential GDP have been revised up a touch. The

staff has assumed that the FOMC will respond to inflationary pressures by raising the

federal funds rate 1-1/4 percentage points, 1/2 percentage points more than in the December

Greenbook. These firming actions are assumed to occur a bit sooner than currently built

into the yield curve and are expected to be accompanied by an edging higher of long-term

yields and a plateauing of equity prices not much above current levels. The growth of real

GDP is now projected at 4 percent in 2000 and 3-3/4 percent in 2001, compared with 3-

3/4 percent for both years in the last Greenbook. The unemployment rate is seen as

remaining around 4 percent over the forecast period. This degree of pressure on resources

is expected to lead to a noticeable acceleration of core consumer prices, with the PCE chain

price index excluding food and energy projected to be rising at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the

second half of 2001, compared with 1-1/2 percent during 1999. Foreign economies are

projected to continue growing briskly, prompting increases in official interest rates in many

major trading partners this year that about match those assumed for the United States. As a

result, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is expected to hold around current levels

through 2000 before depreciating moderately next year as U.S. interest rates flatten out and

swelling volumes of dollar-denominated debt associated with a high and rising current

account deficit weigh on international investment portfolios.



-23-

(29) This bluebook proposes three short-run monetary policy alternatives for the

Committee's consideration at this meeting: an unchanged stance of monetary policy

(alternative B); a 25 basis point firming of the federal funds rate (alternative C); and a 50

basis point tightening (alternative D).

(30) Despite the significant inflation risk embodied in the staff forecast and

identified in the Federal Reserve's announcement following the December meeting, the

Committee might not yet be convinced that policy action is necessary and hence might be

inclined to choose alternative B. Even though labor markets have remained tight for some

time, readings on core prices generally have been well behaved, excepting the pickup in

various NIPA inflation measures for the fourth quarter reported today. While these reports

may be disquieting, the four-quarter changes in these measures remain moderate. Taken

together with other price reports, the recent behavior of core inflation may still be

consistent with trend productivity growth that is strong enough, or a natural rate of

unemployment that is low enough, to restrain inflation for considerably longer than in the

staff forecast. In light of this possibility, the Committee may wish to wait awhile in order

better to assess the extent of inflationary pressures. If the Committee were to keep the

stance of policy unchanged, however, it presumably would want to accompany

announcement of that choice with a statement, under its new policy, that "the risks are

weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the

foreseeable future," given the high rate of labor utilization and the continued strength in

demand that could push that rate even higher.



-24-

(31) In view of the macroeconomic situation and recent Federal Reserve

statements, market participants uniformly seem to expect a tightening of monetary policy at

this meeting, with considerable weight currently being placed on a 25 basis point move and

some probability on a 50 basis point increase. In these circumstances, implementation of

the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, even if accompanied by a

statement that the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside, would confuse investors.

Nonetheless, financial markets, especially for equities, would rally if investors trimmed their

expectations of the extent of cumulative monetary tightening. Short-term market interest

rates would drop nearly 1/4 percentage point, and the dollar would weaken on foreign

exchange markets.

(32) The announcement following the December meeting indicated that the

FOMC was concerned that a continuation of rapid demand growth could lead to an

escalation of inflation pressures. If anything, the upside risks to the economy and inflation

seem to have intensified over the intermeeting period, perhaps inclining the Committee

toward the 25 basis point firming of policy of alternative C. Indeed, those risks would

mount should financial markets rally as a result of policy inaction. And although

productivity may still be accelerating, the momentum of spending risks outstripping the

expansion in available labor, exacerbating strains in already-taut labor markets. The staffs

assessment is that considerable policy firming will be necessary to contain inflation. Even if

the Committee finds this assessment plausible, it still may want to proceed incrementally, as

it typically has done, because of uncertainty about the response of financial markets to its

actions, about the sensitivity of spending to financial market conditions, and about the



-25-

reaction of inflation to labor market conditions. Moreover, long-term inflation expectations

remain damped, suggesting that a rapid shift in the stance of policy is not essential at this

point. Still, the Committee may wish to express the view that, even after the 100 basis

points of cumulative tightening since mid-1999, the risks remain tilted toward increased

inflation pressures.

(33) Investors appear to be anticipating a 25 basis point firming and a statement

that the balance of risks is weighted toward inflation. As a result, these choices would likely

result in little change in market prices. As this is the first Committee meeting under the new

disclosure policy, however, an assessment of the market reaction is somewhat more

uncertain than usual. There is a good chance that market participants would read the

announcement as suggesting that another firming could well be in the offing, but such an

expectation is already consistent with current readings on federal funds futures rates, which

imply a near-certainty of another 25 basis point move at the March meeting.

(34) If the Committee sees recent data as tending to confirm that substantial

monetary restraint will need to be applied over the next year or so to keep inflation in check,

as implied by the staff forecast, it might choose the 50 basis point tightening of policy

contemplated in alternative D. In this circumstance, the Committee might see advantages

to moving well along in the process relatively quickly, to minimize the odds that inflation

expectations begin to rise and to reduce the probability that a protracted period of

tightening will be required. And, it might also want to adopt a statement that it saw the

risks as still being tilted toward higher inflation, which would convey a sense that further

policy tightening might well be needed. On the other hand, if the Committee thought that a



-26-

prompt 50 basis point adjustment had a reasonable chance of being sufficient to contain

inflation to a satisfactory level, at least for some time, it presumably would indicate, under

the formula laid out in its new disclosure policy, that "the Committee believes that the risks

are balanced with respect to prospects for" "its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth."

(35) The 50 basis point tightening at this meeting contemplated under alternative

D is not fully incorporated in market prices, and thus implementation of this alternative

would probably result in nearly a quarter-point rise in money market yields. The effects on

longer-term yields and on equity prices would probably be conditioned importantly by the

FOMC's statement regarding the balance of risks. With a statement of symmetric risks "for

the foreseeable future," any drop in bond prices might be damped as the effects of the

tighter-than-expected stance of policy over the near term are partly offset by some flattening

of investors' expectations of policy tightening after March. If the FOMC instead chose to

link its tightening action with wording indicating that it saw the balance of risks as still tilted

toward inflation, market participants would likely revise upward their expected path of

Federal Reserve tightening. Hence, bond and stock markets would probably sell off, and

the dollar would appreciate on foreign exchange markets.

(36) Under the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, M2 growth

is projected to pick up a bit, to a 6 percent annual rate over the December to June period,

from the 5-1/2 percent rate from September to December, despite a small drag from the

unwinding of Y2K effects. M2 would be somewhat above its provisional 1 to 5 percent

annual range in June. M3 is expected to decelerate sharply, to a 5-1/4 percent rate over the



-27-

December to June period from the 14 percent pace of September to December. Adjusted

for Y2K influences, M3 growth is expected to be about the same in the two periods. M3

also would be above its provisional 2 to 6 percent annual range in June. Growth of the debt

of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to slow, dropping to a 5-1/4 percent rate over

the December to June interval from the 6 percent pace between September and December,

leaving this aggregate a bit above the middle of its provisional 3 to 7 percent annual range in

June.

Directive and Balance of Risks Language

(37) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating to

(1) the Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 2000 that will constitute the first paragraph

of the new abbreviated directive, (2) the sentence comprising the second or operational

paragraph of the directive concerning the objective for the federal funds rate, and (3) the

"balance of risks" sentence to be included in the press release issued after the meeting (not

part of the directive).

I. Growth Ranges for 2000

The wording shown below incorporates changes in the last sentence (relating

to prices) that were proposed in Governor Ferguson's memo of December 17, 1999.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in

output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting

established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of __ to __ [DEL: 4 to 5] percent and

__ to __ [DEL: 2 to 6] percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of

1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000. The range for growth of total domestic

nonfinancial debt was set at __ to __ [DEL: 3 to 7] percent for the year. The

behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light

of movements in their velocities and developments in prices, the economy,

and financial markets.



-29-

II. Operational Paragraph Sentence

To further the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and

sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the federal funds rate at/TO an

average of around ___ [DEL: 5-1/2] percent.

III. "Balance of Risks" Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the

Committee believes that the risks are [balanced with respect to prospects for both

goals] [weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation

pressures] [ weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic

weakness] in the foreseeable future.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabeled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0
percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect
on growth of M -A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively,
and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth
and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the
target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the fourth
quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to
1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3,
and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4
percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised to 2
to 6 percent at the July 1995 meeting.
