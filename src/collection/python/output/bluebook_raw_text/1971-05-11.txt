MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee interest rates in

domestic securities markets have risen very sharply, with advances ranging

to three quarters of a percentage point or more on some long- as well as some

short-term instruments. As their short-term borrowing costs rose, major banks

raised the prime rate from 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 per cent. The steepness of the

general advance in market rates appears to be largely attributable to changed

market expectations about the outlook for interest rates and monetary policy;

banks, for instance, have become less active buyers of securities. This

shift in psychology was prompted initially by a combination of firmer money

market conditions and better business news, and was strongly reinforced by

deepening market uncertainties arising from the foreign exchange crisis.

(2) The rate on the 3-month Treasury bill has been an exception

to the general uptrend of rates. Heavy bill demands from foreign central

banks and domestic investors seeking liquidity have substantially depleted

dealers' bill positions, particularly in shorter maturities. As a result,

while the 3-month rate has fluctuated widely over the inter-meeting period,

reaching a peak level cf more than 4 per cent, most recently it has declined

to about 3.78 per cent, close to the level prevailing at the time of the last

meeting. However, the 6-month and 1-year bills are around 40 and 75 basis

points, respectively, above their levels at that time.



-2-

(3) Over the four-statement-week period since the last meeting,

the Federal funds rate has averaged about 4-1/4 per cent, the upper end of

the range specified by the Committee. Since this was 35 basis points above

the average for the preceding four statement weeks, it was widely interpreted

as evidence of a shift in monetary policy, initiated partly for balance-of-

payments reasons and partly to slow the growth of the money supply. In the

Treasury financing week ending May 5, market uncertainties about monetary

policy were intensified by the crisis psychology created by foreign develop-

ments. In this atmosphere the Federal funds rate rose temporarily to levels

as high as 4-7/8 per cent and averaged 4.41 per cent. In the latter part of

that statement week, and early in the current week, some banks appeared to be

bidding aggressively for Federal funds in anticipation of drains from funds

flowing abroad. In addition, the funds rate was affected by a large

temporary demand for funds from a key money center bank which apparently

substantially miscalculated its weekly reserve position.

(4) The Desk moved actively to supply reserves during the

Treasury financing week and early in the current week, in an effort to move

the Federal funds rate back to the 4-1/4 per cent target. As a result, the

net reserve position of all member banks showed average net free reserves

of $202 million for the week ending May 5. Over the preceding three weeks

the average net reserve position had been close to zero and member bank

borrowing had averaged about $140 million. While both of these latter

averages were significantly less deep than had been specified, the bulk of

the difference reflected a considerable drop in the special borrowing by the

bank that has been a necessitous borrower.



-3-

(5) With securities markets generally unsettled, the Treasury

elected to limit the new issues in its May refunding to two relatively

short maturities--one, a new 15-month, 5 per cent note; and the other,

an outstanding 3-1/2 year, 5-3/4 per cent note (reopened at a discount to

yield 5.88 per cent). While books on the refunding were still open, rumors

of possible revaluations triggered massive speculative dollar flows into

some foreign currencies; this ultimately forced the withdrawal of central

banks from foreign exchange markets in several countries, Uncertainties

regarding this crisis and its implications for domestic interest rates created

generally weak conditions in domestic securities markets and led to major

concern about the success of the Treasury refunding. In this environment

Treasury trust accounts made support purchases of nearly $600 million of U.S.

Government securities, and the Federal Reserve purchased $1.3 billion of

securities, net,--mainly through repurchase agreements--in the week ending

May 5. The results of the Treasury refunding turned out better than might

have been expected, with redemption of public holdings kept to about 30 per

cent of the $5.8 billion of maturing issues.

(6) Immediately following the last meeting of the FOMC the Federal

funds target was moved up to the upper part of the 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent

range specified by the Committee. Thereafter as new data suggested that

the money supply aggregates were running well in excess of their bluebook

paths, the funds rate target was moved up to 4-1/4 per cent. With data for

April nearly complete, however, the monetary aggregates now show a mixed

performance relative to their bluebook paths. The narrowly defined money supply

(M1 ) grew faster than targeted, as the table shows. But the broader money

supply (M2) ran about in line with, and the adjusted credit proxy fell sub-

stantially behind their respective growth targets.

M2 12.5 12.9

Proxy 11.5 5.6

1/ Because March levels of M 1 and M2 were revised upward after the
last bluebook the comparison between actual rates of change and
projected bluebook rates somewhat understates the extent of the
overshoot. For M1 the degree of understatement is about 2 percent-
age points.

(7) The overshoot of M1 relative to the bluebook path was

greatest in the first week of the month, as the following table shows,

Thereafter, the level of M1 receded and by month-end was slightly

below the bluebook path. 1/ The overshoot of M2 relative to target was

much smaller than for M1 because the unexpectedly large bulge in

private demand deposits early in the month was largely offset by a

slowing of the increase in time and savings deposits other than large

CD's. Some deceleration in such deposits was expected from the

record first quarter rate, but the actual slowing exceeded expecta-

tions as the pace of reintermediation at banks apparently dropped off.

1/ This pattern of change was similar to the one in the equivalent
period of 1970--even though a postal strike and an air traffic con-
trollers slowdown were also at work last year--suggesting that the
existing seasonal adjustment factor for April may be missing a new
pattern of money supply change. This may reflect the temporary
repatriation of liquid corporate balances held abroad to comply with
end-of-quarter OFDI regulations.



-5-

Cut-backs in the use of non-deposit sources of funds were also

larger than projected, and large negotiable CD's failed

to grow by even the rather modest amount projected. With both time and

savings deposits and non-deposit sources of funds performing less

strongly than forecast, growth of the adjusted credit proxy was well below

the projection and relatively small.

Prospective developments

(9) Although recent foreign exchange market developments heighten

all the usual uncertainties in assessing the future, the relationships among

money market conditions and monetary aggregates that have evolved since the

last meeting of the Committee strongly suggest that the FOMC's desires expressed

at the last Committee meeting with respect to aggregates for the second quarter

will not be achieved under prevailing money market conditions. Given such

money market conditions, the table on the next page compares the Committee's

desires for the aggregates with current expectations. (The paths shown as

"desired" take the June levels for the aggregates indicated in the previous

Blue Book under alternative C as targets. The annual rates of change for

April and the second quarter differ in many cases from those shown in the

previous Blue Book because the March levels for the aggregates have been

revised since the last Committee meeting. For example the March level of M1

was revised up by $400 million to $219.4 billion. Thus the level of $222.4

billion for M 1 in June represented a 6 per cent annual rate of growth over the

second quarter at the time of the last Committee meeting, but it now represents

a 5-1/2 per cent rate of growth.)

(10) As indicated in the table, the current expectation for growth

in M 1 over the second quarter, given a 4-1/4 per cent funds rate, is 9 per

cent, well above Committee desires. This partly reflects the more rapid

growth that already has occurred in April. But May-June growth--at about a

7-1/2 per cent annual rate--is also expected to be more rapid than earlier

desired by the Committee. The relatively rapid growth expected for May-June

reflects in the main the lagged effect of earlier interest rate declines as

well as further upward revision made in light of the unexpected strength in

April.

(11) The future behavior of money supply and U.S. Government

deposits is, of course, subject to considerable uncertainty in view of foreign

exchange market conditions. We have assumed that about $2-1/2--$3 billion

dollars taken in by foreign central banks in recent days will be invested for

at least a few weeks in Treasury special issues, with proceeds flowing into

Treasury deposits. This could be associated to some extent with a temporary

reduction in money growth from what it otherwise would be. On the other hand,

money growth could be temporarily stimulated if further sizable reserve

supplying operations were to be required in the event, for instance, that the

foreign exchange situation is not unwound in such a way as to calm domestic

credit market nervousness.

(12) While M1 growth seems likely to be more rapid than desired

in the second quarter, given a 4-1/4 per cent Federal funds rate, growth in

M2 may turn out quite close to the previously desired path and growth in the

adjusted credit proxy may be considerably less than desired. Given recent

experience, we are projecting a somewhat greater slowing in net inflows

of time deposits other than large CD's than we had earlier; and this offsets,

in its effect on M2, the greater than desired growth in M1. As a result,

the current expectation for about a 10 per cent M2 growth rate in the second

quarter is about the same as that earlier indicated as being acceptable to

the Committee.



-10-

(13) The projected second quarter slowing in growth of time

deposits other than large CD's also tends to restrain growth in the

adjusted credit proxy. Growth in the proxy is also dampened by the

sharp drop in nondeposit sources of funds and by relatively weak behavior

of large CD's. There would seem to be little need for aggressive

bidding for CD money, at least between now and mid-year, given the

comfortable liquidity positions of banks and expectations of only

moderate business loan growth.

(14) Diverse movements developing in the aggregates, unresolved

(as of this writing) exchange market uncertainties, and the recent weak-

ness in bond markets present the Committee with many potentially conflict-

ing objectives. To clarify policy possibilities in view of these conflicts,

three distinct policy alternatives--with sharply differing specifications

--are presented on the following pages: Alternative A aims at stabiliz-

ing credit market conditions; Alternative C aims at pursuit of the

Committee's previously expressed desires with respect to M1 growth; and

Alternative B aims at a "standard-sized" FOMC tightening of operational

targets in the interest of moderating the growth of the aggregates some-

what. Aggregate specifications monthly for these alternatives through

the third quarter are shown in the table on the following page. 1/ Alterna-

tive A there represents a continuation for the aggregates of the column

"current expectations" shown in the table on page 8. Alternative C

represents a continuation from that table of what was desired for

1/ Weekly paths between now and the next meeting of the Committee are

M1 at the previous FOMC meeting together with needed modifications of

other aggregates for the sake of consistency, given the recent changes

that have evolved in relationships among the various aggregates.

Alternative B takes a middle course. The text table below shows money

market conditions believed consistent with these alternatives.

Fed Funds Member Bank M1
Rate Borrowings 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr

Alternative A 4-1/4 100-200 9% 8-1/2%

Alternative B 4-3/4 250-350 8-1/2% 7-1/2%

Alternative C 6--8 450-700 5-1/2% 6%

(15) Under alternative A, with a funds rate around 4-1/4 per

cent, M1 is expected to continue growing relatively rapidly through the

third quarter, although slowing somewhat on balance from the very rapid

pace of recent months. The growth rate in M2 is expected to moderate

further to a 9 per cent annual rate by the third quarter. On the other

hand, following a sluggish performance in the spring, the adjusted credit

proxy may grow more rapidly on balance in June and the third quarter as

nondeposit sources of funds stop running off and as modest CD growth is

resumed. For the second quarter, growth in the proxy may be at only a

4-1/2 per cent rate, followed by about an 8 per cent growth rate in the

third quarter.

(16) Between now and the next meeting of the Committee, the

3-month bill rate under alternative A may be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent

range. The rate could temporarily come under downward pressure over the



-13-

very near-term in view of the relatively small market supply of short

bills in a period when customer demands for bills may be sizable, includ-

ing demands from investors who chose to redeem the mid-May Treasury

maturities and from some foreign official accounts who do not place

dollars in special Treasury issues. However, in late May the Treasury

will be raising a substantial amount of new cash probably in the bill

area, with the amount depending on how long foreign funds remain invested

in special issues and on whether the Treasury offers another Euro-dollar

certificate abroad. With the Federal funds rate returning to around

4-1/4 per cent, bond market pressures are likely to moderate, assuming

a reasonable resolution of current exchange market uncertainties. The

current Treasury refunding will be settled on May 17; dealer positions

in the new issues are very light, as the Treasury has undertaken sizable

buying of when-issued securities.

(17) Alternative B--which assumes a funds rate centering on

4-3/4 per cent--leads to a somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates

over time. The growth rate in M1 slows gradually; it is still likely to

be growing at around an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate on average in May, but

in subsequent months through the summer the growth rate may move down to

around 7 per cent on average. Growth in M2 may be affected somewhat

sooner by the higher funds rate, and over time the growth rate may diminish

by about a percentage point relative to alternative A. Only a minor slow-

ing in the credit proxy is projected, as CD growth may be sustained, if not

enhanced, as tighter money market conditions lead to anticipatory borrow-

ing by banks.



-14-

(18) The 3- onth bill rate would be likely to rise under

alternative B, perhaps to around 4-1/2 per cent, or somewhat higher if

expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate should develop.

Should expectations of a discount rate move become pervasive, it may also

tend to keep bond yields under upward pressure. Apart from the effects of

such expectations, the recent run-up in bond yields has anticipated a good

part of the firming in day-to-day money rates of the magnitude contemplated

in this alternative.

(19) Alternative C presents the staff's best estimate as of

this moment of the money market conditions required to rapidly move M 1

back to the growth path previously desired by the Committee for the second

quarter, and assuming M1 growth at a 6 per cent rate in the third quarter.

A wide and high range of 6 to 8 per cent for the funds rate is presented,

partly to allow for the sharp increase in interest rates that might be

required to dampen money demand over a short period of time. For instance

in May and June, growth in M1 would have to be reduced to a 2-1/2 per cent

annual rate under this alternative. The higher interest rates likely to be

associated with this M1 behavior would have a considerable dampening effect

on growth in time deposits other than large CD's, and growth in M2 would be

further constrained, with about a 7-1/2 per cent rate expected for the second

quarter. Growth in the credit proxy would likely be quite small. Even

though banks are assumed to bid more aggressively for large CD's and perhaps

non-deposit funds as growth in demand deposits and consumer-type time

deposits diminish, bank credit would be expected to rise by only a 2-1/2

per cent annual rate over the second quarter under this alternative.



-15-

(20) Should money market conditions tighten as much as indicated

for this alternative between now and the next meeting of the Committee, both

short- and long-term rates would likely rise very dramatically, and questions

would be raised about the prospects for continued growth in consumer-type

time and savings deposits under current interest rate ceilings. The current

discount rate would obviously be far out of line with the market conditions

associated with this policy alternative.

Possible directive language

(21) This section presents possible language for the second

paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses discussed

above. All three alternatives include a reference to the current Treasury

financing (for which the payment date is May 17) and to uncertainties in

foreign exchange markets. In addition, all three alternatives retain the

language of the present directive relating to purchases of coupon issues.

(22) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to call for maintenance of prevailing money

market conditions, subject to a proviso clause.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of

the Treasury financing the terms of which are to be

announced late in the month,] System open market opera-

tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be

conducted with a view to [DEL: attaining temporarily some

minor firming in] MAINTAINING PREVAILING money market

conditions, while continuing to meet some part of

reserve needs through purchases of coupon issues in the

interest of promoting accommodative conditions in



-16-

long-term credit markets; provided that SOMEWHAT

FIRMER money market conditions shall be SOUGHT

[DEL: modified] if it appears that the monetary and

credit aggregates are [DEL: deviating] significantly

EXCEEDING [DEL: from] the growth paths EXPECTED [DEL: desired],

TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE CURRENT TREASURY FINANCING

AND UNCERTAINTIES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS."

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the

money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (14) as a

description of "prevailing" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso

clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connec-

tion with alternative A as the "expected" paths. Use of the word

"expected" rather than "desired" is suggested in connection with these

growth paths since the rates shown for M1 are well above those the

Committee has previously indicated that it desired. Also, a one-way

proviso clause (guarding against significant excesses but not shortfalls)

is suggested, on the assumption that the Committee would not want market

conditions to be eased on the coming period if the aggregates should fall

short of the indicated paths. A directive with this general structure--

putting primary emphasis on money market conditions rather than the

aggregates--can, of course, be used in connection with specifications

other than those shown for alternative A, with suitable language changes.

(23) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction

in terms of desired growth rates for the monetary and credit aggregates

(subject to the constraints that might be imposed by the Treasury financing

and foreign exchange market uncertainties), and (b) to adopt as targets the

growth rates (including an 8-1/2 per cent second-quarter rise in M1) discussed

earlier in connection with alternative B.

"To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS

TO MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES

OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD, [DEL: while] taking account of the

CURRENT Treasury financing [DEL: the terms of which are to be

announced late in the month,] AND UNCERTAINTIES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE MARKETS. System open market operations until

the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted

with a view to [DEL: attaining temporarily some minor firming

in] MAINTAINING BANK RESERVES AND money market conditions

CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, while continuing to meet

some part of reserve needs through purchases of coupon

issues in the interest of promoting accommodative conditions

in long-term credit markets; [DEL: provided that money market

conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary

and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from

the growth paths desired]."

The phrase "to moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the

months ahead" is suggested as a summary description of the objectives for

the aggregates because the paths anticipated for both M1 and M2 involve

some gradual slowing on average in coming months.



-18-

(24) Alternative C. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to adopt as targets the growth rates

(including a 5-1/2 per cent second quarter rise in M1) discussed earlier

in connection with alternative C.

"To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS

TO PROMOTE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AND CREDIT

AGGREGATES, while taking account of the CURRENT

Treasury financing [DEL: the terms of which are to be

announced late in the month,] AND UNCERTAINTIES IN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS. System open market opera-

tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be conducted with a view to [DEL attaining temporarily

some minor firming in] MAINTAINING BANK RESERVES AND

money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH THOSE

OBJECTIVES, while continuing to meet some part of

reserve needs through purchases of coupon issues in

the interest of promoting accommodative conditions in

long-term credit markets; [DEL: provided that money market

conditions shall be modified if it appears that the

monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly

from the growth paths desired]."

This language differs from that shown under alternative B only in that it

describes the objective for the aggregates as that of seeking "to promote

moderate growth" (rather than "seeking" to moderate growth')and it omits



-19-

the phrase "over the months ahead." This formulation is suggested since

the growth paths associated with this alternative involve a sufficient

slowing of the aggregates to bring growth in M1 down to the pace

previously desired by the Committee within the present quarter.

NOTES. Aggregate reserve series have been adjusted to eliminate changes in percentage reserve requirements against deposits, but reserve requirements on
Euro-dollar borrowings are included beginning October 16, 1969, and requirements on bank-related commercial paper are included beginning October 1,
1970. Adjusted credit proxy includes mainly total member bank deposits subject to reserve requirements, bank-related commercial paper, and Euro-
dollar borrowings of U.S. banks. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks. Monthly data are daily averages except for nonbank commercial
paper figures which are for last day of month. FR 712 - F
