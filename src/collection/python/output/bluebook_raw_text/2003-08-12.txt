MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Longer-term interest rates increased sharply over the intermeeting

period in sometimes volatile trading conditions, more than reversing the considerable

decline that occurred over the weeks following the May FOMC meeting.  Some of

the backup took place in response to the FOMC’s decision in June to cut the

intended federal funds rate 25 basis points to 1 percent, as investors had placed

substantial odds on a larger move and were reportedly surprised that the

accompanying statement made no mention of unconventional monetary policy

measures (Chart 1).1  Longer-term rates continued to climb over much of the

remainder of the intermeeting period.  Investors apparently interpreted the

Chairman’s monetary policy testimony, the release of FOMC members’ economic

projections, and incoming news on the economy and corporate earnings as signaling

that a rebound in economic growth was likely and that substantial further disinflation

would probably not materialize, thus obviating the need for further reductions in the

federal funds rate or unconventional policy measures.  A large volume of hedging

activity by holders of mortgage-backed securities, and to a lesser extent a

deterioration in the outlook for the federal budget, likely amplified the upward

movement in bond rates.  On net, the ten-year Treasury yield rose about 100 basis

points—the largest intermeeting advance in more than fifteen years.  Judging from

yields on Treasury inflation-indexed securities, much of this increase represented a

2  By contrast, surveys indicate that market and business economists generally see a
more extended period during which the stance of monetary policy remains unchanged.

rise in real interest rates, although inflation compensation also moved appreciably

higher.  The sizable fluctuations in interest rates were accompanied by a deterioration

in the liquidity of certain markets, although conditions have improved considerably

over the past few days (see the box entitled “Liquidity Conditions in Fixed-Income

Markets”).

(2) Shorter-term Treasury yields rose by less than those on longer-term

issues, in part because the Chairman’s testimony helped anchor near-term

expectations for monetary policy.  Investors appear nearly certain that the funds rate

target will be left unchanged at the upcoming FOMC meeting, and rates on money

market futures suggest that policy is expected to remain on hold until early 2004.2 

However, the upward trajectory of policy expectations thereafter is now much steeper

than at the time of the last FOMC meeting, and quotes on options contracts imply

that the perceived odds of additional reductions in the federal funds rate have

declined substantially.  The current low level of overnight interest rates has apparently

contributed to a large increase in the frequency of delivery failures of fixed-income

securities, although that step-up reportedly has not had significant adverse effects on

the functioning of markets as a whole (see the box entitled “Substantial Rise in Fails-

to-Deliver of Treasury and Other Securities”). 

(3) Despite the sharp rise in Treasury yields, broad equity indexes were

down only slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period (Chart 2).  Equity prices were

supported by earnings reports for the second quarter that surpassed expectations,

strong profit forecasts for subsequent quarters, and increased confidence in economic

prospects.  Investors showed particular interest in riskier stocks, with the Nasdaq and

Russell 2000 indexes outperforming the broader market.  In addition, investors’

perceptions of credit risk appeared to diminish further over the intermeeting period.

Liquidity Conditions in Fixed-Income Markets

The sharp fluctuations in longer-term interest rates resulted in a notable deterioration in
the liquidity of fixed-income markets and a significant widening of yield spreads on swaps,
agencies, and mortgage-backed securities around the end of July, but conditions have
improved considerably in recent days (Chart 3).  The difficulties were primarily associated
with the decline in mortgage prepayment risk and the resulting extension in the duration
of outstanding mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rather than elevated credit concerns. 
Investors seeking to offset this increase in duration sold large volumes of Treasury
securities and entered into sizable quantities of interest rate swaps to pay fixed rates. 
Dealers in the Treasury and swap markets at times had difficulty accommodating the
selling pressure, and they began to post wider bid-ask spreads to compensate for the risks
associated with the greater volatility of the market.

The deterioration in liquidity was particularly notable in the swap market, where bid-ask
spreads on ten-year swaps widened to as much as 10 basis points from a typical level of
1 basis point.  The liquidity of Treasury securities held up better, but bid-ask spreads for
on-the-run issues still widened to ½ basis point from a usual level of ¼ basis point, and
market depth reportedly declined some.  Investors paid a higher premium for the on-the-
run ten-year Treasury note relative to off-the-run issues, although that premium was not
outsized relative to those recorded in recent years.  The erosion in liquidity also spilled
over to the markets for mortgage-backed and agency debt securities.

Spreads on intermediate- and long-term swaps relative to Treasury securities increased
sharply over the period.  This widening was apparently driven by the magnitude of
hedging-related flows and the considerable deterioration in the liquidity of swaps rather
than any unusual concern about counterparties or heightened aversion to credit risk.  To
date, little evidence has emerged that any major market participant has suffered losses
sufficient to threaten its viability, and credit default swap premiums do not indicate any
unusual concern about the health of financial firms more generally.  Poor liquidity also
contributed to a widening of spreads on mortgage-backed securities over Treasuries
(adjusted for prepayment risk) and on agency debt issues, developments that may have
been exacerbated by market speculation that the European Central Bank and euro-area
national central banks were reducing their exposure to agency issues.

In recent days, liquidity has recovered substantially for many of these instruments,
although conditions have not fully returned to normal levels.  Swap, agency, and MBS
spreads have also retraced much of their widening as liquidity has improved.

Substantial Rise in Fails-to-Deliver of Treasury and Other Securities

Failures to deliver securities in the Treasury and other markets have risen substantially
since the last FOMC meeting (Chart 3).  Fails in the Treasury market have been
particularly severe in the ten-year note maturing in May 2013, which, as the on-the-run
issue over most of the intermeeting period, was heavily used in hedging transactions. 
However, fails have been elevated in other Treasury issues and in agency and mortgage-
backed securities as well.  Dealers have increasingly turned to the Federal Reserve’s
securities lending program to obtain securities that are difficult to acquire in the market.

A fail-to-deliver takes place when a party that has sold a security does not deliver the
security as agreed.  In those circumstances, the market convention is to postpone the
settlement of the transaction without changing the price.  During this intervening period,
the firm that was supposed to deliver the security loses the opportunity to earn interest on
the proceeds, because it does not receive these funds until the security is delivered.  

A firm would presumably avoid failing if it were possible to obtain the security in a
repurchase agreement (RP) in which it was lending money at an above-zero interest rate,
rather than at the zero percent effective rate it earns if it fails to deliver.  When there is
considerable demand in the market for a particular security, the rate at which firms are
willing to lend money against that issue will often move below the general level of
overnight interest rates—that is, the security goes “on special.”  When the RP rate for a
given issue drops all the way to zero, the pecuniary incentive to deliver an issue on a timely
basis disappears.  Indeed, the RP rate for the May 2013 note has been pinned at zero since
late June, coinciding with the high level of fails in that issue.  By historical standards, it is
not unusual for the RP rate on the on-the-run ten-year note to be 100 basis points less
than the federal funds rate; however, this degree of “specialness” would not have
generated elevated fails if short-term interest rates had been higher.

Although the increase in fails has had adverse effects in the RP market for certain
Treasury issues, market participants report that it has not resulted in any significant
deterioration in the functioning and liquidity of fixed-income markets in general.†  Going
forward, fails to deliver may stay elevated as long as short-term interest rates remain low. 
However, recent increases in the size and frequency of auctions of Treasury securities may
help alleviate the volume of fails by increasing the supply of securities in the market.

____________________
†  The elevated level of fails has posed some relatively minor issues for the conduct of open
market operations.  When foreign central bank customers do not receive securities that they
expected, their funds may remain at the Federal Reserve and thus result in a reserve drain. 
Because of the increase in fails, reserve misses caused by errors in predicting foreign deposits
have increased somewhat.

 .  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or
Treasury.

Yield spreads on low-grade corporate bonds narrowed substantially, although they

have retraced some of that decline of late.  Yields on high-grade corporate bonds, by

contrast,  moved up roughly in line with those on Treasury securities, leaving their

spreads about unchanged. 

(4)  The improved U.S. economic outlook and the increase in interest rates

helped buoy the dollar, which gained 1½ percent over the intermeeting period against

an index of currencies of major foreign trading partners.  Better U.S. prospects also

spurred optimism about likely spillovers to the global economy, and tentative signs of

stronger growth were evident in some foreign countries as well.  Yields on long-term

foreign government securities moved up sharply during the intermeeting period,

although by less than in the United States, and stock price indexes in many countries

firmed.  The dollar recorded its largest gains—about 2½ percent—against the

Canadian dollar and sterling; in both cases, authorities surprised markets by easing

monetary policy, pointing to signs of lower inflation and weaker activity.  Against the

euro, the dollar gained less—about 1 percent—as euro-area indicators of business

and consumer confidence improved and better earnings reports by euro-area firms

helped push up stock indexes in some major European countries.  The dollar rose

only ¾ percent against the yen.3  Stock prices in Japan rose about 4 percent and yields

on long-term government bonds moved up 25 basis points amid some signs of

firming economic conditions. 

(5) The dollar rose slightly against an index of the currencies of our other

important trading partners.  Stock prices in most Asian emerging markets recorded

solid gains, as investors were encouraged by confirmation that the SARS epidemic

had waned and by improved prospects for global recovery.  Toward the end of the

intermeeting period, however, rate increases and volatility in U.S. fixed-income

markets reverberated in some higher-risk foreign financial markets.  Such spillovers,

together with worries about the pace of the Brazilian structural reform program,

caused the EMBI+ spread for Brazil to widen 90 basis points and the real to lose

nearly 5 percent versus the dollar.

(6) Available indicators suggest that borrowing by U.S. nonfinancial firms

remained sluggish in July (Chart 4).  Net corporate bond issuance slowed abruptly

from its robust pace of previous months, largely in response to the upswing in yields

on investment-grade bonds, while commercial paper rose for the first time in five

months.  C&I loans continued to run off, even as banks reported in the Senior Loan

Officer Opinion Survey that they eased spreads and fees on those loans for the first

time since 1998.4  In the household sector, consumer credit grew at a moderate pace

in the second quarter, while mortgage debt expanded briskly, although a bit less so

than in previous quarters.  More recently, applications for mortgage refinancing

dropped sharply in response to the sizable increase in mortgage rates.  The Treasury

continued to borrow in large quantity:  Federal debt expanded at a 24 percent pace on

a seasonally adjusted basis in the second quarter, and the Treasury announced that it

was raising its estimate of third-quarter borrowing needs substantially from the

forecast it made in late April.  State and local governments also borrowed heavily in

the second quarter, but the pace of advance refundings fell off in July, presumably

reflecting the jump in interest rates.  Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is

estimated to have surged at a 10½ percent pace in the second quarter, with much of

that strength owing to government borrowing.

(7) M2 expanded rapidly in June and July, propelled by the lagged effects of

past declines in the opportunity cost of holding money, measured as the yield on

three-month Treasury bills less the weighted average rate on the components of M2. 

In addition, M2 was likely boosted by a surge in escrow accounts associated with the

high volume of mortgage refinancing activity and, perhaps, by the increases in

disposable incomes resulting from recent changes in tax law.  Over the last two weeks

of July, households appear to have reduced their portfolios of bond mutual funds,

possibly in response to losses suffered during the sharp increase in long-term interest

rates, and some of those outflows were likely deposited into M2 accounts.



8

Policy Alternatives

(8) The staff forecast prepared for this FOMC meeting continues to

anticipate a significant acceleration of economic activity over coming quarters, fueled

by the sizable degree of monetary accommodation already in place and considerable

fiscal stimulus—and perhaps evidenced by some recent economic data.  The pickup

in growth next year, however, is noticeably less vigorous than that presented by the

staff in June, primarily reflecting the marked increase in longer-term interest rates, a

slight reduction in equity values, and the modest climb in the foreign exchange value

of the dollar since then.  In the staff forecast, bond yields stay near their current

elevated levels until next spring, when they begin to drift lower as markets come to

recognize that economic conditions are such that the FOMC will be maintaining the

1 percent funds rate target for longer than had been expected.  Stock prices are

predicted to rise sufficiently to generate risk-adjusted returns comparable to those on

fixed-income instruments, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar edges lower. 

With economic growth a little slower than in the June Greenbook, slightly less

progress in reducing slack is foreseen over the next year and a half.  In the fourth

quarter of 2004, the civilian unemployment rate is expected to be ½ percentage point

above the staff’s estimated NAIRU of 5 percent and the output gap is projected at ½

percent.  After picking up slightly in coming months owing to the unwinding of some

factors that had damped it during the first half of the year, core PCE inflation is

projected to trend down gradually, reaching an average pace next year just under 1

percent.  Overall PCE inflation is expected to run a touch lower than the core rate in

2004, reflecting falling energy prices.  

(9) Encouraged by recent data pointing to a firming of aggregate demand,

FOMC members may continue to see good odds on an acceleration of output over

the rest of this year and next year, in line with the contour of their economic

projections reported to the Congress in July.  Such an outlook may prompt the



9

Committee to keep policy unchanged at this meeting.  Even if policymakers would

prefer faster progress in boosting rates of resource utilization in the near term, they

might believe that, given the usual lags in the effects of policy, an easing now would

not significantly affect the economy until a brisk expansion likely was already

underway.  Thus, the Committee might anticipate that, with a flat federal funds rate,

the projected outcomes for real activity, resource use, and inflation are about the best

that can be achieved.  Moreover, Committee members might view the backup in

longer-term interest rates over the past few weeks in part as signaling that the

economy could be even stronger than forecast by the staff, reflecting a recent

fundamental improvement in business confidence and spending propensities (see the

box entitled “Changes in Yields and Revisions to Market Expectations for Economic

Activity”).  The Committee might also continue to consider substantial further

disinflation to be unlikely.  Core PCE inflation in the Greenbook moves down only a

little next year and, judging by the central tendencies of the inflation projections

reported in July, policymakers foresee even less disinflationary pressure than the staff. 

With the risk of deflation apparently remote and the zero bound on the funds rate

still a full percentage point away, policymakers may prefer to keep policy on hold for

a time while assessing inflation trends and the strength of the pickup in economic

activity, including the response of spending to the additional tax cuts that have just

begun to show up in disposable income.  

(10) Even if the Committee believes that a pickup in economic growth is in

train, as in the staff forecast, it may prefer to take action to reduce resource slack

more quickly than in that outlook, and in the process diminish the risk of substantial

further disinflation, by easing 25 basis points at this meeting.  The Committee

might view the downward revision to projected growth next year resulting from the

jump in bond  



10

Changes in Yields and Revisions to Market Expectations for Economic Activity

The sharp backup in bond yields over the intermeeting period was associated with an
upward revision to investors’ expected path for the funds rate, presumably owing to a
change in their views of underlying economic strength or inflationary pressures.  Under
the assumption that investors use a Taylor rule to formulate expectations for the funds
rate, it is possible to estimate the extent of those upward revisions.  For the calculations
presented in this box, we also assumed that the market’s near-term forecasts for potential
GDP and its perceptions of the long-run equilibrium real funds rate and inflation
objective of the Federal Reserve—all of which appear in the Taylor rule—were
unchanged and that the term premiums in futures contract rates held constant.  

Eurodollar futures rates for the fourth quarter of 2004 rose 0.9 percentage point over the
intermeeting period.  Using a coefficient on the output gap in the Taylor rule of unity and
assuming that the market’s outlook for inflation was unchanged, the rise in futures
contracts would imply a comparable increase in the expected level of real GDP that
quarter of about 1 percent.  This estimate is similar to one obtained using a simulation of
the FRB/US model.

The estimate would be altered if inflation expectations had changed appreciably over the
intermeeting period.  Although some indicators of short-term inflation expectations edged
lower, five-year inflation compensation as measured by the difference between nominal
and inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased by about a percentage point.  If
inflation expected by investors for the fourth quarter of 2004 also rose by that amount,
the Taylor rule would have implied an increase in expectations for the level of economic
activity at that time of only ½ percent rather than 1 percent.

These inferences from financial markets contrast with the 0.4 percent downward revision
to the Greenbook outlook for the level of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The
staff forecast can be interpreted as having assumed that the stronger outlook for economic
activity that investors have now adopted had already been built into the June Greenbook
projection.  In consequence, the rise in interest rates had the effect of damping spending
in the current Greenbook.   

rates as unacceptable and as warranting a prompt policy response.  Also, the

Committee might believe that the trajectory of inflation in the Greenbook is too low

to provide a sufficient buffer against the zero bound on nominal interest rates in

coming years and might wish to foster a slightly higher path for inflation by easing



11

policy further.  Alternatively, policymakers may anticipate that firms and households

will be more cautious about spending than the staff expects, perhaps along the lines

of the “prolonged subpar investment” or “weaker fiscal response” alternative

simulations in the Greenbook.  Even apart from concerns about continued

sluggishness in aggregate demand, Committee members may have revised down their

inflation projections over the intermeeting period because of supply-side

considerations, such as productivity growth that has persistently come in on the high

side of expectations.  In addition, short-term inflation expectations, as measured by

the Michigan survey, have edged lower of late, as have measures of actual core

consumer price inflation that sometimes are used as proxies for anticipated inflation,

and expectations seem likely to edge down further as actual inflation drifts lower.  A

policy easing might be seen as desirable to prevent a rise in the real funds rate and,

perhaps, to move it back below the range of estimated equilibrium values (Chart 5). 

(11) Under either choice for the funds rate, the Committee might wish to

maintain the assessment of risks to the outlook adopted in June, despite some

significant changes in financial markets and in the staff forecast over the intermeeting

period.  The Committee might see the risks to inflation as still tilted to the downside,

particularly given the low readings on actual inflation, the good news on productivity,

and the likely drag on aggregate demand growth from the recent jump in bond yields. 

And even if policymakers’ expectations for real growth next year have been lowered

somewhat, as in the Greenbook, they probably remain consistent with a gradual

closing of the output gap, suggesting that the risks to attaining sustainable growth are

still roughly balanced.

(12)  Market participants apparently see almost no chance of a policy move

or shift in the FOMC’s assessment of risks at this meeting.  Financial markets

therefore would tend to react little to a Committee decision that confirmed those

expectations, although the wording of the announcement could have a noticeable

effect on market prices for a time.  An announcement that emphasized the signs of

nascent strength in the economy and suggested little concern about the recent backup

in interest rates would tend to support the current higher levels of yields and the

foreign exchange value of the dollar.  But a statement that underscored the

tentativeness of the pickup and alluded to the recent tightening of financial

conditions might lead to some easing of market interest rates and the exchange value

of the dollar.  A 25-basis-point cut in the funds rate accompanied by maintenance of

the current risk assessment would surprise markets and likely induce a comparable

decline in short-term interest rates.  To the extent that the move was seen as a

reaffirmation of an intent to keep the federal funds rate low for a considerable period

and, more particularly, as a reaction to the backup in longer-term yields, bond and

stock markets also might rally considerably.

(13) M2 is projected to decelerate in the months ahead, but growth in that

aggregate over the second half of the year should remain considerably faster than that

of nominal GDP.  The current wave of mortgage refinancings is likely to subside in

response to the recent sharp increases in longer-term interest rates, thereby damping

growth of the liquid deposits in which prepayments are temporarily held.  However,

the lagged effect of past decreases in opportunity costs should continue to buoy this

monetary aggregate over the balance of this year.  Under the Greenbook forecast, M2

is projected to grow around 8 percent over the four quarters of 2003, implying a

decline in its velocity of about 3¼ percent.

(14) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is also expected to decelerate

over the second half of the year.  The growth of home mortgage debt is likely to slow

further from the vigorous pace set last year, while the expansion of consumer credit is

projected to stay fairly subdued.  With the financing gap continuing to be modest as

increases in internal funds about keep pace with rising capital expenditures, business

borrowing should pick up only slightly.  Federal borrowing will presumably remain



13

robust, though dropping back from its outsized second quarter pace.  State and local

borrowing is forecast to decelerate sharply as advance refundings are scaled back

owing to higher interest rates.  Over the four quarters of 2003, total domestic

nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow 7¾ percent, with its nonfederal

component expanding 6¾ percent.

Directive and Risk-Assessment Language

(15) Presented below for the members’ consideration is (1) draft wording for

the directive and (2) draft language to convey the substance of the risk assessment,

assuming that the Committee wishes to retain the current form of that assessment:

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its

long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in

reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/INCREASING/reducing the

federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ___ percent.

(2) Risk Assessment

The Committee wishes to include in the official announcement to be released after

the meeting (but not to be included in the directive) the substance of the following

assessment:

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available:

The risks to its outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next

several quarters [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE DOWNSIDE] 

[are balanced] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; the

risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters [are

weighted toward the downside] [ARE BALANCED] [ARE

WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; and, taken together, the

balance of risks to its objectives  [are weighted toward the downside] 

[ARE BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]

in the foreseeable future.
