 CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

SUMMARY 

Conditions in financial markets showed some limited signs of improvement over 

the intermeeting period.  Investor concerns about financial institutions appeared to 

ease somewhat, with a number of major banking organizations posting better-than-

expected first-quarter earnings results.  An index of bank equity prices rose notably, 

outperforming broad equity indexes, although credit default swap (CDS) spreads for 

large banking organizations were little changed, on net, at elevated levels.  Rates on 

short-term funding instruments generally edged lower, and functioning in markets for 

these instruments improved.  Nevertheless, market participants appear to remain 

concerned about the methodology and results of the stress tests for banks and 

potential policy responses to the results. 

Yields on nominal Treasury securities decreased modestly, on net, over the 

intermeeting period.  Yields dropped appreciably following the FOMC announcement 

on March 18 that the Federal Reserve would purchase up to $300 billion of longer-

term Treasury securities and increase its purchases of agency debt and agency 

mortgage-backed securities, but yields subsequently retraced a significant portion of 

that drop amid a perceived improvement in the economic outlook and perhaps some 

reversal of flight-to-quality flows.  Yields on corporate bonds fell a bit more than 

those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving risk spreads a little 

narrower, though still very elevated.  Other risk spreads also narrowed somewhat, 

although they remained high relative to their historical ranges.  Rates on mortgages in 

the primary and secondary markets declined over the intermeeting period, benefiting 

from the announced expansion of Federal Reserve large scale asset purchases.   



Despite the lower interest rates, net private sector debt appears to have contracted 

in the first quarter.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations has been robust, but 

much of the proceeds have been used to pay down short-term borrowing.  Residential 

mortgage applications have picked up.  This increase appears to largely reflect 

refinancing activity, and mortgage debt is projected to contract in the first quarter.  

Results from the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated a further 

tightening of banks’ lending policies and a further weakening of demand for loans 

from both businesses and households.   

A number of central banks in both developed and emerging economies eased 

monetary policy over the intermeeting period.  Prices in foreign stock markets surged, 

especially those for bank stocks, amid a general improvement in investor sentiment 

and some reports of better-than-expected performance from financial firms in the 

United States and Europe.  Sovereign bond yields in advanced economies generally 

rose, and the dollar declined against most major currencies. 

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 

Concern about the health of U.S. financial institutions appeared to abate 

somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period.  An index of bank equity prices 

increased about 20 percent, reflecting in part better-than-expected first-quarter 

earnings results at some large banking organizations (Chart 1).  The prices of 

preferred equity of large bank holding companies also rose significantly.  Nonetheless, 

concerns about the condition of banks persisted.  Earnings statements generally noted 

heavy provisioning for loan losses, causing some smaller banking organizations to 

post losses in the first quarter.  CDS spreads for large bank holding companies and 

for other banks remained elevated.  Rating agencies lowered credit ratings for Wells 

Fargo and Bank of America on March 25.  Investors continue to be uncertain about 

the methodology being used in the stress tests of large banking organizations; the

results of those tests, which will be released in early May; and the likely policy 

responses.1  On April 2, FASB voted to modify the rules related to fair value 

accounting for illiquid assets and “other than temporary impairments.”2  These 

changes were reportedly seen as benefiting financial institutions, but some market 

participants have raised concerns that the changes could reduce transparency in the 

financial sector.  Market participants were also concerned about the potential 

influence of the accounting rule changes on banks’ reported earnings.  A few small 

banks began repaying the capital injections received through the TARP program, and 

Goldman Sachs announced its intention to use the funds from its $5 billion April 14 

equity offering to do the same.  Concerns regarding the capital position of insurance 

companies appeared to diminish following market reports that some insurance 

companies would be eligible to receive TARP funds.  Insurance company equity 

prices rose about 25 percent, but CDS spreads for these institutions were little 

changed on net. 

During the intermeeting period, the Treasury announced details regarding the 

public-private investment partnership (PPIP) program to purchase legacy assets from 

financial institutions.  This announcement was initially well received by market 

                                           
1 A white paper describing the assumptions underlying the stress tests and the methodology 

used to implement the tests will be released April 24.  
2 The new fair value guidance for illiquid assets reduces the emphasis that should be placed 

on the “last transaction price” in valuing assets when markets are not active and 
transactions are likely to be forced or distressed.  The new guidance for other-than-
temporary-impairments will require that only the credit-related portion of a debt security’s 
fair value impairment—the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows 
and the amortized cost basis—be written-down through earnings when two criteria are 
met: the institution does not have the intent to sell the debt security and it is unlikely that 
the institution will be required to sell the debt security before a forecasted recovery of its 
value.  In the event the two criteria are not met, the full impairment—the difference 
between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value—must be written-down 
through earnings.

participants.  Of late, however, market uncertainty about the efficacy of government 

support to the financial sector has increased, as investors have reportedly become 

more hesitant to participate in some government programs as a result of concerns 

about risk coming from political pressures such as possible disclosure of program use 

or restrictions on their hiring and compensation practices.  Some market participants 

are also said to be concerned that the Legacy Loans Program portion of the PPIP will 

attract few sellers, as they believe the difference between current market values of 

eligible assets and those reflected on banks’ books to be quite large. 

Issuance of banking organization senior obligations guaranteed by the FDIC 

under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) totaled about $25 billion 

over the intermeeting period.  Spreads of yields on securities issued under this 

program to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries generally moved down over the 

intermeeting period.  On April 1, TLGP fees were increased and both the issuance 

and guarantee periods were extended.3  On April 6, Standard and Poor's announced 

that it will no longer automatically assign an A-1+ rating to all short-term FDIC-

guaranteed debt owing to the rating agency's concerns about the timeliness of 

repayment in the event of default.  This rating action does not appear to have had any 

notable effect to date.  

MARKET FUNCTIONING 

Functioning in many financial markets improved over the period.  Conditions in 

short-term bank funding markets improved somewhat, with reports that the volume 

of lending had generally risen.  Libor fixings (and spreads over OIS) inched down, 
                                           
3 Changes to the FDIC program included an increase in guarantee fees for debt with a one-

year maturity or longer, with insured depository institutions having smaller fee increases 
than holding companies; an extension of the period for which FDIC-guaranteed debt can 
be issued to the end of October 2009; and an extension of the end date for the guarantees 
under the program from June 30, 2012, to year-end 2012. 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 5 of 64



perhaps reflecting in part reduced concerns about counterparty credit risk (Chart 2).  

Even so, Libor-to-OIS spreads remain elevated, especially at maturities beyond one 

month.  Consistent with some easing of conditions in bank funding markets, amounts 

bid in the TAF auctions conducted over the period were below the levels seen earlier 

this year, and primary credit outstanding fell about $25 billion, to $45 billion.  

Overnight general collateral repo rates have also edged down recently, converging 

toward the federal funds rate, and the volume of longer-maturity repo transactions 

reportedly increased.  Median bid-asked spreads for repo transactions involving most 

types of collateral were little changed, although bid-asked spreads for transactions 

involving agency MBS declined a bit.  Delivery fails on Treasury securities remained 

low despite the low level of interest rates.  Consistent with steady or improving 

conditions in the term repo market, the amount of loans outstanding under the TSLF 

program continued to decline, and the last two TSLF auctions involving Schedule 1 

collateral received no bids.4  During the intermeeting period, the New York Fed 

increased the regular SOMA securities lending program minimum rate from 1 basis 

point to 5 basis points in view of improved market functioning. 

Spreads on both AA-rated asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and A2/P2-

rated commercial paper (CP) moved down a bit further.  The amount of nonfinancial 

CP and ABCP outstanding declined over the intermeeting period, in part because 

firms substituted longer-term funding and also because overall demand for financing 

diminished.  Financial CP outstanding edged up, on net, over the past several weeks.  

Credit extended under the CPFF held steady over the intermeeting period at about 

$240 billion, while credit extended under the AMLF continued to decline, reaching a 

level of just $1 billion.5  Nonetheless, market participants reportedly continue to view 

                                           
4 Two dealers terminated TSLF loans early owing to concerns regarding political risks. 
5 During the week starting April 27, about $150 billion in CP at the CPFF will mature.

the Federal Reserve programs related to the CP market as providing important 

support. 

Functioning in the Treasury market also improved over the intermeeting period, 

reportedly owing in part to the Federal Reserve’s open market purchases.  Spreads 

between the yields on on-the-run and off-the-run notes have narrowed significantly, 

although they remain wide.  Similarly, fitting errors from staff yield-curve models have 

diminished, although they remain large.  Average bid-asked spreads for on-the-run 

Treasury notes were relatively stable at pre-Lehman levels.  Nevertheless, trading 

volumes remained low by historical standards, despite considerable issuance.   

Indicators of functioning in the corporate bond market—such as bid-asked 

spreads estimated by the staff—suggest that conditions in the speculative-grade 

segment of the market continued to be strained, although they improved relative to 

the fall of last year.  Similarly, the leveraged loan market showed some improvement 

over the last few months, with the average bid-asked spread narrowing and the 

average bid price moving up some from very depressed levels.  In the CDS market, 

changes were introduced on April 8 to reduce counterparty risk and improve 

operational efficiency by making trades more standardized and fungible, with the 

intent of facilitating the movement towards central clearing.  Prior to the 

implementation of these changes, liquidity in the CDS market reportedly had declined.  

However, no significant disruption was reported following the changes and liquidity is 

said to have returned to recent norms.  The basis between the CDX Investment 

Grade index of CDS spreads and measures of investment-grade corporate spreads—a 

rough proxy for unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the corporate market—

remained at high levels, due to an ongoing lack of financing capacity at major financial 

institutions.

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

The Committee’s decision at the March meeting to leave the target range for the 

federal funds rate unchanged was widely anticipated.6  However, investors were 

apparently surprised by the FOMC’s announcement that it would increase 

significantly further the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by purchasing up 

to $300 billion in Treasury securities and expanding purchases of agency MBS and 

agency debt by up to $750 and $100 billion, respectively.  (See box entitled “Balance 

Sheet Developments During the Intermeeting Period.”)  In addition, market 

participants reportedly interpreted the statement that the federal funds rates was likely 

to remain exceptionally low for “an extended period” as stronger than the phrase “for 

some time” in the previous statement.  Following the release of the FOMC statement, 

rates on Eurodollar futures contracts and yields on Treasury, agency, and mortgage-

backed securities all fell considerably.7  The initial decline in the path for the federal 

funds rate implied by futures rates was subsequently reversed, perhaps in response to 

the modest improvement in the economic outlook (Chart 3).  Based on our standard 

term premium assumption of 1 basis point per month, market quotes currently 

suggest that market participants anticipate that the FOMC will start to raise the 

federal funds rate around the end of 2009.  However, staff models suggest that term 

premiums could well be higher than usual, implying a flatter path for the expected 

federal funds rate.  Only four respondents to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers 

expect the target federal funds rate to be raised before the third quarter of 2010, with 
                                           
6 Two other notable announcements regarding Federal Reserve monetary policy were made 

during the intermeeting period.  On March 23, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury 
announced an accord regarding the appropriate roles of the Federal Reserve and the 
Treasury to preserve financial and monetary stability.  On April 6, the Federal Reserve 
announced that it had entered into currency swap arrangements with several foreign central 
banks that would enable the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity in foreign currencies.  
Neither announcement appeared to prompt any market reaction. 

7 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.15 percent over the intermeeting period.

Balance Sheet Developments During the Intermeeting Period 

Since the March FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve’s total assets have 
expanded by about $130 billion to around $2,200 billion.1  The expansion primarily 
reflected an increase of $215 billion in securities held outright; the Open Market 
Desk purchased $139 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $60 billion in 
U.S. Treasury securities, and $17 billion in agency securities.2  The purchases of 
agency mortgage-backed securities have been concentrated in newly issued 30-year 
MBS, while the purchases of U.S. Treasury and agency securities have been 
concentrated in maturities of less than seven years and less than five years, 
respectively.  In addition, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) 
conducted its first two operations: The TALF lent roughly $6 billion to finance the 
issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by auto and credit card loans; prior 
to these operations, there had been no significant issuance of these classes of ABS 
since last summer.   

The effect of the System’s securities purchases on total assets was damped by a 
decline in lending through liquidity programs for financial firms.  Foreign central 
bank liquidity swaps declined $47 billion; the sum of primary, secondary, and 
seasonal credit declined $25 billion; term auction credit declined $13 billion; and 
primary dealer and other broker-dealer credit declined $12 billion.3  The runoff in 
credit provided under these facilities reflected in part improvement in short-term 
funding markets, with market participants noting that rates have declined and 
lending volumes have increased in term bank funding and repurchase agreement 
markets.  Securities lent through the Term Securities Lending Facility, which do not 
affect assets because the Federal Reserve retains ownership, declined by $62 billion.  
Dealers reduced or stopped their use of this facility for a number of reasons, 
including the improved market conditions, continued deleveraging, and concerns 
about government restrictions on program participants. 

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the expansion was 
reflected primarily in a sharp increase of $145 billion in the reserve balances of 
depository institutions.  The U.S. Treasury’s General Account remained elevated 
and quite volatile during the intermeeting period due to inflows of corporate and 
personal tax receipts, but it declined $15 billion, on net.  The Supplementary 
Financing Account remained unchanged at $200 billion over the period.

3 The amount of term auction credit and the amount of foreign central bank liquidity swaps are expected to 
  decline $52 billion and $32 billion respectively, on April 23, 2009.

half of the respondents anticipating the first rate increase to occur during or after the 

first quarter of 2011, roughly the same as in the last survey.  The primary dealers also 

placed small but non-negligible odds on the Committee modestly increasing the scale 

of asset purchases over the next few meetings.    

Immediately following the FOMC announcement, yields on two- and ten-year 

nominal Treasury securities dropped about 20 and 40 basis points, respectively.  A 

portion of these initial declines was retraced over the intermeeting period amid a 

perceived improvement in the economic outlook, the abatement of concern about 

financial institutions, continued strong Treasury issuance, and perhaps some reversal 

of flight-to-quality flows.  Yields on both two- and ten-year nominal Treasury 

securities ended the period down about 15 basis points.  Implied volatility on long-

term Treasury yields decreased substantially following the FOMC meeting, and staff 

estimates of term premiums also moved down.  Spreads between the yields on agency 

debt securities and those on comparable maturity Treasuries narrowed at shorter 

maturities but were little changed at longer horizons. 

Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than those on their 

nominal counterparts, especially at the five-year horizon.  As a result, five-year 

inflation compensation rose about 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent, possibly owing in part 

to an increase in energy prices.  Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead was 

little changed over the intermeeting period at around 2.5 percent.  Although it has 

improved of late, poor liquidity in the TIPS market continued to make these readings 

difficult to interpret.  Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey also 

jumped, but long-term expectations edged down.  The primary dealers’ median 

forecast for core PCE inflation was marked up slightly in 2009 to 1 percent, but 

revised down somewhat to 0.5 percent in 2010.

CAPITAL MARKETS 

Broad stock price indexes rose notably, on balance, over the intermeeting period, 

with the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index (formerly the Wilshire 5000) up 

about 10 percent (Chart 4).  However, even after this increase, this index is down 

about 5 percent for the year.  Implied volatility in the S&P 500 continued to decline 

from the exceptionally high levels of last fall, but it remains quite elevated.  Early 

earnings reports from S&P 500 firms combined with analyst estimates suggest that 

earnings declined about 40 percent in the first quarter relative to the year-earlier 

period.  With the rise in equity prices and downward revisions to the outlook for 

corporate earnings, the difference between the forward trend earning-price ratio and 

an estimate of the real long-run Treasury yield—a rough proxy for the equity risk 

premium—has declined but remains extremely high.   

In the corporate bond market, yields and spreads to comparable-maturity 

Treasury securities moved down over the intermeeting period, with the decline 

particularly pronounced for below-investment grade firms.  Nevertheless, risk spreads 

for both investment-grade and speculative-grade bonds stayed very high as investors 

reportedly continue to be concerned about credit quality deterioration and perhaps 

also cautious about taking on additional risk.  Both investment- and speculative-grade 

CDX indexes declined over the intermeeting period.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial 

corporations remained extremely strong in March.  Most of the recent issuance, 

however, has been by investment-grade firms, as these firms apparently acted to lock 

in longer-term financing.  Some of the proceeds from the bond issuance have 

reportedly been used to pay down bank loans and commercial paper.  In contrast, 

bond issuance by speculative-grade firms has been modest.  Issuance of leveraged 

loans in the first quarter of 2009 was extremely weak, down nearly 60 percent from 

the same period of last year; issuance of institutional loans totaled only $2 billion.

Indexes of CDS spreads on senior AAA-rated CMBS narrowed after the 

announcement of the PPIP and the expansion of the TALF to include legacy assets.  

By contrast, indexes of CDS spreads on junior-AAA and lower-rated tranches of 

CMBS widened as the credit ratings of some of these tranches were lowered owing to 

increased expected losses. 

The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages has continued its 

downward trend and is currently a bit below 5 percent, likely reflecting in part the 

support provided to the mortgage market by the Federal Reserve through its 

purchases of agency debt and agency MBS.  The low mortgages rates have spurred an 

increase in refinancing activity.  Issuance of mortgage-backed securities by the GSEs 

picked up notably in February, but issuance of non-agency mortgage-backed securities 

has continued to be non-existent.  The consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) 

market also saw a pickup in issuance and decline in spreads.  These developments may 

owe in part to the implementation of the TALF program, where the first two 

subscriptions resulted in about $6.5 billion in loans being extended; however, 

investors reportedly remain hesitant about participating in this program for some of 

the same reasons they are wary of the PPIP.  A few ABS deals were issued without 

Federal Reserve support, including one that was eligible for the TALF.  Perhaps 

reflecting in part the improvement in the secondary market, interest rates on 

consumer loans also generally moved down some. 

State and local governments continued to issue a moderate volume of long-term 

bonds, with higher-rated issuers accounting for the bulk of these offerings.  The ratio 

of yields on long-term municipal bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries 

continues to be above historic norms.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 

Major foreign stock market indexes rose during the intermeeting period, 

apparently supported by improved market sentiment and boosted by some reports of 

better-than-expected performance from financial firms in the United States and 

Europe (Chart 5).  Banking sector share prices outperformed broad stock price 

indexes in Europe.  In the United Kingdom, Barclays and Standard Chartered Bank 

reported a strong start of the year.  Barclays also announced that it had passed the 

FSA’s stress test, decreasing the odds that the bank would participate in the U.K. 

government’s Asset Protection Scheme.  In contrast, the equity prices of Japanese 

banks changed little on balance amid worries about the financial condition of some 

institutions.  Credit availability in interbank and other wholesale markets continued to 

increase modestly in the wake of the optimism that boosted equity markets, with 

Libor-to-OIS spreads in euros and sterling declining over the period.   

Long-term bond yields in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the euro area fell 

sharply after the FOMC announcement on March 18 but have retraced their declines.  

On net, German and Canadian ten-year yields changed little, while Japanese and U.K. 

ten-year yields increased 12 to 45 basis points.  These moves in yields, which occurred 

despite the many central bank actions over the period to loosen monetary policy, 

reportedly were in response to reduced risk aversion, signs of incipient stabilization in 

the pace of economic contraction, and concerns about heavy future supply.  In 

particular, U.K. gilt yields increased over the period despite the Bank of England 

having purchased about £30 billion in gilts since the start of its quantitative easing 

program on March 11.  On April 8, the European Central Bank cut its main 

refinancing rate 25 basis points to 1.25 percent, less than the expected 50 basis point 

cut, and deferred a decision regarding any use of unconventional policy tools to its 

next Governing Council meeting in May.  The Bank of Canada halved its key

overnight interest rate to 25 basis points and indicated that, although it does not 

anticipate it to be necessary, it would be ready to purchase debt if the outlook of the 

economy worsened further.  Any specific moves would be announced in upcoming 

policy meetings.  The Bank of Japan left its target for the call rate unchanged but 

expanded some non-traditional policy measures:  It increased the size of its monthly 

purchases of government bonds from ¥1.4 trillion to ¥1.8 trillion and it announced 

that it will expand its eligible collateral to include municipal debt.  Many central banks 

in emerging market economies have further eased monetary policy.  Market 

participants expect that foreign central banks will continue to ease policy in 2009.  

The dollar depreciated sharply in the days following the March FOMC meeting 

and the smaller-than-expected rate cut by the European Central Bank.  The major 

currencies index of the dollar decreased on net about 1.5 percent during the 

intermeeting period, as depreciation versus the Canadian dollar, the yen, and sterling 

more than offset a modest appreciation against the euro.  The dollar index for other 

important trading partners decreased about 2 percent, as reduced risk aversion and the 

announcements by several developing economies of agreements with the IMF on 

financing packages improved sentiment towards those regions.  Mexico became the 

first country to seek an arrangement with the IMF under the newly established 

Flexible Credit Line, and it also drew on its liquidity arrangement with the Federal 

Reserve.  At its April meeting, the G-20 agreed to support a general allocation of 

SDRs equivalent to $250 billion to increase global liquidity. 

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY 

Private sector debt appears to have contracted again in the first quarter.  The staff

mortgage market reflected mostly refinancing, and the staff estimates that household

mortgage debt contracted again in the first quarter, depressed by continued weak 

housing demand, falling house prices, and writedowns of nonperforming loans.  

Consumer credit was essentially flat, on net, in the first quarter despite the generally 

lower interest rates on consumer loans.  Nonfinancial business debt growth has been 

tepid as robust bond issuance was partly offset by declines in commercial paper and 

bank loans.  Amid the ongoing heavy debt issuance by the Treasury, federal debt grew 

at a more than 20 percent rate in the first quarter. 

Commercial bank credit is estimated to have contracted again in March and April.  

The weakness in bank credit owes importantly to a drop in loans to businesses, as 

C&I loans fell almost 13 percent at an annual rate in March, reflecting in part 

paydowns with the proceeds of bond issuance.  Commercial real estate loans declined 

almost 2 percent.  The run-off in business loans appears to be continuing in April.  

Bank lending to households was also weak in the spring.  Owing to considerable sales 

of single-family mortgages to the GSEs, residential mortgage loans on banks’ books 

declined, on balance, in March and the first part of April.  Consumer loans held by 

banks also ran off amid heavy securitization.  In contrast, credit extended under 

revolving home equity lines of credit continued to expand at a robust pace, partly 

reflecting relatively attractive terms on existing lines. 

The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted 

in April indicated that banks continued to tighten their credit standards and terms on 

all major loan categories over the past three months.  The net fraction of banks that 

reported tightening their business lending policies, while still elevated, edged down for 

the second consecutive survey.  In contrast, somewhat larger net percentages of banks 

reported having tightened credit standards on residential mortgages than in the 

January survey.  Banks also reported a further tightening of standards and terms on 

credit cards and other consumer loans.  A large majority of respondents cited a less 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 64



favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific 

problems, and a reduced tolerance for risk as important reasons for the move toward 

a more stringent lending posture.  In a set of special questions, large majorities of 

domestic and foreign respondents indicated that they expect credit quality for all types 

of business and household loans to worsen in 2009.  Large net fractions of banks also 

reported a further weakening of demand for most types of loans, with the notable 

exception of residential mortgages to prime borrowers where demand was reported to 

have increased.   

M2 grew at a rapid clip in March despite the weakness in nominal income.  

Growth was boosted a few percentage points by large deposits in late February and 

early March at one commercial bank that were made by a corporate customer in 

anticipation of executing a take-over bid.  Robust expansion in liquid deposits more 

than accounted for the rise in M2 and was likely fueled by a continued reallocation by 

households toward safer assets.  Retail money market funds and small time deposits 

contracted in March, probably as a result of the continued decline in rates paid on 

these assets.  Growth of currency was brisk in March, apparently reflecting strong 

foreign and domestic demand.  Consistent with the expansion of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet, total reserve balances also increased in March.  Growth in 

both currency and total reserves contributed to rapid expansion of the monetary base 

last month.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

Information received since the March meeting indicates that the labor market has 

continued to deteriorate sharply and that business fixed investment has retained 

considerable downward momentum.  Nonetheless, equity prices have rebounded 

strongly since mid-March, consumer spending appears to have leveled off, and some 

tentative signs of stabilization have been evident in the housing sector.  Looking 

ahead, the staff forecast is predicated on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will 

not implement any further liquidity or credit programs beyond those that have already 

been announced and that it will not further expand its large-scale asset purchase 

programs.  As in March, the staff also assumes that the FOMC will hold the target 

federal funds rate within its current range through the end of the forecast period.  

Long-term Treasury yields edge higher over the period as the window over which 

expected future short-term rates are averaged moves forward and thus encompasses 

fewer years of near-zero funds rates, but they do so from a level about 15 basis points 

lower than in the previous forecast.  Investment-grade corporate bond yields have 

moved down about 45 basis points since the March Greenbook and are projected to 

decline another 140 basis points over the forecast horizon as risk spreads narrow 

further from their current high readings.  Mortgage rates are anticipated to remain at 

about their current level—which is about 20 basis points lower than in March—over 

the medium term, reflecting the offsetting influences of a slight continued downward 

drift in their spread to Treasuries and the projected rise in Treasury yields.  Equity 

prices are projected to increase at an annual rate of 15 percent from a level about 18 

percent higher than at the time of the previous forecast, as the equity risk premium 

moderates gradually.8  The foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined by close 

                                           
8 Note that equity prices rose about 10 percent between the close of the March Greenbook 

and the March FOMC meeting. 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 64



to 3½ percent over the intermeeting period and is assumed to edge lower over the 

balance of this year and fall by about 2 percent in 2010.  Broadly consistent with 

futures quotes, oil prices move up to $56 per barrel by the end of this year and to $63 

per barrel at the end of 2010, levels that are about $8 per barrel higher than at the 

time of the March Greenbook.   

Against this backdrop, real GDP is expected to decline at an annual rate of 1½ 

percent in the second quarter, a bit more slowly than in the previous forecast.  Output 

is projected to stabilize in the third quarter, and a moderate recovery is expected to 

get under way late this year.  Nevertheless, with GDP growing more slowly than 

potential output through the first quarter of next year, the unemployment rate is 

projected to increase to 9¼ percent in the fourth quarter of this year and remain at 

that level, on average, in 2010.  Core PCE prices are expected to rise at a slightly 

higher rate than previously projected, reflecting higher energy prices and a stronger 

economic outlook; still, low levels of resource utilization, the lagged effects of large 

declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, and reductions in core import 

prices are expected to hold core PCE inflation to 1.2 percent in 2009 and just 0.7 

percent in 2010.  Headline PCE prices are projected to increase 0.7 percent in 2009 

and 1 percent next year.   

Looking further ahead, the staff forecasts real GDP to expand about 5 percent 

per year, on average, from 2011 to 2013, as monetary policy remains stimulative, 

financial turmoil subsides, and the recovery in residential construction gains 

momentum.  With actual output outpacing its potential by a wide margin, the 

unemployment rate declines steadily over this period, reaching 4¾ percent (the staff’s 

estimate of the NAIRU) by late 2013.  Under the assumption that long-run inflation 

expectations remain relatively well anchored, the gradual recovery in real activity 

allows core PCE inflation first to stabilize and then begin to move up slowly to  

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 64



1.1 percent by 2013.  Beyond 2013, monetary policy fosters an extended period of 

modestly above-average resource utilization in order to bring inflation gradually back 

to the desired rate of 2 percent.  Once this is achieved, the real economy settles into a 

balanced growth path with trend expansion of about 2¾ percent per year, an 

unemployment rate of 4¾ percent, and a nominal federal funds rate of about 4¼ 

percent.

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

As shown in Chart 7, all of the estimates of short-run r*—that is, the value of the 

real federal funds rate that would close the output gap within 12 quarters—have 

moved up since the March Bluebook.  The Greenbook-consistent measure of short-

run r* is currently about -3¼ percent.  This estimate has risen about 2 percentage 

points since March, mainly as a result of the recent increase in equity prices and the 

depreciation of the dollar.  These factors have also pushed up by a similar amount the 

FRB/US model estimate of short-run r*, which now stands at about -6¾ percent; this 

estimate does not incorporate the judgmental estimates of fiscal stimulus or the 

effects of unconventional monetary policy that are embedded in the Greenbook-

consistent measure.  (In the estimation of the FRB/US model’s short-run r*, all the 

exogenous variables are forecasted using simple rules that do not take account of the 

staff’s projection.)  Higher equity prices have also boosted the short-run r* estimate 

from the small structural model; it is now about -9 percent.9  Apart from the estimate 

produced by the single-equation model, all of the estimates are substantially below the 

actual real funds rate of -1¾ percent; the estimate from the single-equation model, 

which does not explicitly control for the effects of financial stress or fiscal stimulus, is 

in line with the actual real rate.

10-year BBB corporate rate, replacing the Moody’s BAA corporate rate.  The Moody’s rate 
was less affected by the financial crisis than the rates facing most BBB issuers.  If the 
definition had been changed in March, the estimate of short-run r* from the small 
structural model would have been 1½ percentage points lower than the value shown in the 
March Bluebook.

are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to an inflation 

goal of 2 percent, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding 

changes in the funds rate.  As in recent Bluebooks, monetary policy is severely 

constrained by the zero lower bound in these simulations, and the nominal funds rate 

remains close to zero through 2013 (black solid lines).  As a result, the real funds rate 

hovers around -1 percent through the entire simulation period.  Chart 8 also displays 

counterfactual results that would be obtained if the zero bound did not constrain the 

nominal federal funds rate (blue dashed lines).  This counterfactual scenario can 

provide a useful benchmark for considering the stimulus that may be provided by 

unconventional monetary policy (see box “Policy Paths for Large-scale Asset 

Purchases”).  Under this unconstrained policy, the funds rate falls to -7½ percent late 

next year, rising back above zero in 2012.  The real funds rate decreases to about -8½ 

percent by the end of 2010.  Relative to the constrained case, such a policy places the 

civilian unemployment rate on a distinctly lower path over the next few years and core 

PCE inflation on a higher path.10  These paths for unemployment and inflation are 

essentially the same as those in March (red dotted lines).  The unconstrained 

prescription for the nominal funds rate in the current Bluebook is above the March 

path, reflecting the somewhat stronger outlook for aggregate demand now seen by the 

staff.   

As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds rate at its 

effective lower bound through the end of 2011.  (The midpoint of the Committee’s  

                                           
10 The paths of core PCE inflation under all three policies are markedly different from the 

ones shown in the previous Bluebook; these differences reflect methodological changes in 
the specification used to simulate the behavior of long-run inflation expectations.  For 
details, see the memo to the FOMC, “Large-scale Asset Purchases and Inflation 
Expectations in the FRB/US Model” by David Reifschneider and John Roberts (April 20, 
2009).  To facilitate the comparison to previous conditions, results under the unconstrained 
policy for March were regenerated using the new specification.

Policy Paths for Large‐scale Asset Purchases 

In recent work, the staff has conducted optimal control 
simulations of the FRB/US model in which large-scale asset 
purchases (LSAPs) serve as the instrument of monetary policy 
while the federal funds rate is constrained by the zero lower 
bound.1  This box presents an illustrative simulation of an 
optimal control LSAP policy and then highlights some challenges 
and sources of uncertainty in specifying the appropriate 
magnitude and timing of asset purchases.2 

In this simulation, LSAPs provide stimulus to the real 
economy by lowering longer-term yields; policymakers aim at 
keeping unemployment near the NAIRU and inflation near a 2 
percent objective, and they prefer not to hold more of these 
assets on the Federal Reserve balance sheet than usual and not to 
make large adjustments in asset holdings.  The top panel on the 
right shows simulated paths of longer-term asset holdings 
acquired by the Federal Reserve through LSAPs, which would 
normally be zero.  Conditional on the staff’s economic outlook, 
the optimal control path of LSAP holdings (black solid line) 
peaks at almost $4 trillion by early 2011; in subsequent years this 
path gradually approaches the Greenbook baseline (green dotted 
line), which goes to zero after 2013. 

As shown in the lower panels, this more aggressive LSAP 
path fosters a somewhat faster pace of recovery than in the 
Greenbook baseline.  By the end of 2010, the unemployment 
rate is about ½ percentage point lower than the baseline while 
core inflation is somewhat above the staff projection.  These 
LSAP paths are between the baseline outcome and the 
unconstrained optimal control simulation paths reproduced from 
Chart 8 (blue dashed line), in which the federal funds rate is 
allowed to fall below zero and the path of LSAPs is held at the 
Greenbook baseline. 

The scale of purchases in this optimal control simulation of 
LSAPs is about twice as large as simulations shown in a box in 
the March Bluebook,3 while the outcomes for unemployment 
and inflation are broadly similar.  The main reason is a 

                                           
1 The memo “Optimal Paths for Large-scale Asset Purchases” by Eileen Mauskopf and Jae Sim, sent to the  
  FOMC on April 20 2009, describes the simulations and underlying assumptions in more detail. 
2 The LSAP simulation shown is the same as the “lower cost” path shown in the box “Large-Scale Asset  
  Purchases and the Economic Outlook” in Part I of the Greenbook.   
3 The simulations in the March Bluebook were based on a given scale of LSAPs of up to $2 trillion without  
  concern for optimal control. 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 64



downward revision in the staff’s assessment of the likely effects of asset purchases on longer-
term yields.4  In the LSAP simulation shown here, an announcement of purchases over the next 
two quarters decreases yields by reducing the expected net supply of longer-term debt relative to 
the total stock of government debt.  In light of recent data on interest rate movements, the effect 
of purchasing a given share of the market for longer-term assets is now estimated to be 
somewhat lower than assumed in earlier staff work.  This estimate is subject to a wide margin of 
error and could change considerably as additional information is incorporated.  Furthermore, 
actual and projected levels of government debt have surged since late 2008, reducing the 
expected responses of yields to asset purchases of a given dollar size. 

There is also considerable uncertainty concerning how yields are affected by purchases of 
different categories of assets.  In the simulations reported in the March Bluebook, the staff 
assumed that purchases of MBS and agency debt have larger effects on their own yields than 
purchases of Treasury securities have on Treasury yields.  The data tend to confirm that recent 
purchases had indeed larger effects on MBS and agency yields, but since their spreads have 
declined, the staff assumes that the responses of such yields to any future LSAPs would be 
roughly similar to the effects on longer-term Treasury yields. 

Additional considerations add to uncertainty regarding the effect of LSAPs on the economy.  
One particularly uncertain factor is whether yields are affected primarily by the stock of 
purchased assets or by the flow of purchases.  Another source of uncertainty is the extent to 
which yields are affected by the announcement of future LSAPs as opposed to their execution.  
These issues are hard to assess empirically given the very limited data available. 

Finally, LSAPs may raise some significant risks that are not incorporated in the staff model 
or sufficiently captured by assumptions about policymakers’ preferences for avoiding large 
holdings of longer-term securities as well as rapid adjustments in such holdings.  For example, 
financial markets might be disrupted by outsized LSAP purchases or by the heavy sales that 
might be required if the economy were to recover more rapidly than anticipated.  The LSAP 
simulation shown here requires the Federal Reserve to buy almost half the stock of outstanding 
longer-term Treasury debt, agency debt, and agency MBS.  At this scale, the scope of purchases 
would have to be extended to the secondary market and off-the run securities and would crowd 
investors out of the primary market, as net borrowing of the U.S. Treasury is projected to reach 
only $2.8 trillion over the next two years.  Moreover, purchases of the scale shown on the 
previous page would boost the reserves of depository institutions by up to $4 trillion, putting 
massive upward pressure on the size of their balance sheets—which currently total only about 
$15 trillion—at a time when many institutions are seen as having weak capital positions.  As a 
result, depository institutions could pull back from lending even further, potentially offsetting at 
least a portion of the expansionary effect of the LSAP.  Finally, the very large purchases 
contemplated here expose the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve to considerable interest rate 
risk, pointing to the possibility of significant capital losses, in particular if large and rapid sales of 
securities proved necessary to regain control over the federal funds rate.

  on Interest Rates” by Joseph Gagnon, sent to the FOMC on April 23 2009, describes the revised estimates

0 to 25 basis point target range is taken as the effective lower bound.)  Given the 

somewhat less sluggish outlook, the federal funds rate begins to increase a couple of 

quarters earlier than in the March Bluebook.11  Financial market participants appear to 

anticipate that the funds rate will rise to 1½ percent by the end of 2010 and 

subsequently reach a plateau at just under 3 percent.  Compared with those shown in 

the March Bluebook, the confidence intervals around these forecasts, derived from 

market prices of interest-rate caps, are tighter through 2013.12   

The lower panel of Chart 9 provides near-term prescriptions of simple policy 

rules.  As shown in the left hand columns, these funds rate prescriptions are generally 

constrained by the zero lower bound.  The right hand columns show the prescriptions 

implied by these rules if the zero lower bound is not imposed.  In this case, the Taylor 

(1993) rule prescribes a funds rate of about ¼ percent this quarter and -½ percent 

next quarter.  The Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a funds rate close to -3 percent this 

quarter and -3¾ percent next quarter, reflecting the rule’s higher sensitivity to the 

output gap.  The estimated outcome-based and forecast-based rules also prescribe 

negative nominal federal funds rates for the next two quarters. 

                                           
11 The procedures used to generate confidence intervals with the FRB/US model have been 

substantially modified since the last Bluebook, and are now based on a longer and more 
volatile sample period.  By itself, this change generates appreciably wider intervals for 
forecasts of the federal funds rate.  However, this effect is offset for near-term interest rate 
forecasts by another methodological change to the way the zero lower bound is imposed 
on the outcome-based policy rule.  For further details, see the memo to the FOMC, 
“Changes in Macroeconomic Uncertainty” by Robert Tetlow and Peter Tulip (April 20, 
2009). 

12 Given the uncertainty about the economic and financial outlook, reading policy 
expectations from federal funds futures and options is not straightforward; in particular, 
the term premium may be larger than usual.  The most recent dealer survey shows that no 
respondent expects an increase in the target rate before the first quarter of 2010 and that 
half of respondents anticipate the first rate increase to occur during or after the first quarter 
of 2011.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents two policy alternatives and a variation on the language of 

one of the alternatives for the Committee’s consideration, summarized by the draft 

statements on the following pages.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would 

expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to as much as $750 billion and 

would lengthen the time period over which these purchases would take place to the 

end of the year.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would instead maintain the 

course of policy announced in March and not make any changes to the planned 

purchases of long-term assets.  Under Alternative B´, the Committee would also stay 

the course, but in the Committee’s statement the purchases would be translated into 

both an approximate dollar amount per month and an average monthly percentage 

growth rate of the System’s holdings of these assets through the end of the year.  All 

three alternatives introduce language stating explicitly that the Committee’s future 

decisions as to the timing and overall amounts of purchases of long-term assets will 

depend on the evolution of the economic outlook and on changes in financial 

conditions.  Under all alternatives, the Committee would seek to maintain the federal 

funds rate within the current range of 0 to ¼ percent and would again communicate 

its expectation that the federal funds rate is likely to remain at exceptionally low levels 

for an extended period.

March FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates 
that the economy continues to contract.  Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and 
tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales 
prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories 
and fixed investment.  U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners 
have also fallen into recession.  Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the 
Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, 
together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of 
sustainable economic growth. 

In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation 
will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist 
for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer 
term. 

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions 
are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  
To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee 
decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet further by 
purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing 
its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its 
purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion.  
Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to 
purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months.  
The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the 
range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial 
assets.  The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the 
Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial and economic developments.

 April FOMC Statement — Alternative A 

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
indicates that the economy continues to contract.  Job losses, lower housing wealth, 
and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  
Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut 
back on inventories and fixed investment.  Although the economic outlook has 
improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of 
financial market conditions, the Committee anticipates that economic activity will 
continue to contract in the near term and that the subsequent recovery could be 
sluggish. 

2. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that 
inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation 
could persist for a time below rates that are most consistent with sustainable 
economic growth and price stability in the longer term. 

3. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary 
stimulus by stepping up its purchases of longer-term securities.  To improve 
conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve has recently begun 
purchasing longer-term Treasury securities, and the Committee now intends to 
acquire up to $750 billion of these securities by year-end.  The Committee continues 
to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency 
mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt over the course of 
this year.  The Committee is prepared to make further adjustments to the timing and 
overall amounts of these purchases of Treasury, agency, and mortgage-backed 
securities as appropriate in view of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in 
financial markets.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds 
rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant 
exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Federal 
Reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and 
supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs.  
The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the 
Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of financial and economic developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B   

If policymakers believe that the Committee has already put in train a substantial 

amount of monetary stimulus and think that the Federal Reserve’s policies, coupled 

with the effects of the fiscal stimulus approved by the Congress and the 

implementation of the financial stability plan, will likely suffice to return the economy 

reasonably promptly to a path of sustainable growth, they could decide to reaffirm the 

course of policy announced in March, as in Alternative B.  Mortgage rates have 

declined substantially since the Committee first announced its intention of purchasing 

large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  Similarly, long-term 

private yields have declined somewhat, on net, since the March announcement that 

the Committee would increase its purchases of agency securities and would begin 

purchasing Treasury securities.  The Committee may be of the view that these lower 

rates are providing stimulus to the economy that is likely to increase in coming 

months as households and businesses respond with a lag to the lower rates.  Indeed, 

the data received over the intermeeting period suggested some stabilization in 

consumer spending and housing activity, and the staff has revised up its outlook for 

growth during the remainder of this year and next year.  Against this backdrop, the 

Committee may see no compelling reason to further expand the size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet and may prefer instead to observe how the economic situation 

unfolds before considering an additional expansion of the planned accumulation of 

longer-term assets.  The option of waiting before deciding to acquire even more of 

those assets may be especially attractive if the Committee is concerned that holdings 

of long-term assets could prove difficult or costly to unwind when that becomes 

necessary.   

Some of the credit and liquidity facilities that the Federal Reserve put in place to 

facilitate the extension of credit to businesses and households have seen diminished 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 64



usage of late.  Even though some of the decline in usage may be attributable to 

government-imposed conditions that are viewed as onerous by borrowers, members 

may judge that the decline has been largely a reflection of the improvement in 

financial conditions observed over the intermeeting period.  If so, the Committee may 

see no need to compensate for that reduction with an increase in asset purchases, 

particularly given that the Federal Reserve balance sheet has expanded since the 

March meeting.  In addition, incoming data have pointed to somewhat higher-than-

expected inflation.  Members might interpret the latter development as tentative 

evidence that the downside risk to price stability has diminished slightly amid higher 

energy prices and less bleak prospects for economic activity, reinforcing the judgment 

that there is no need for immediate further expansion of asset purchases.    

The statement suggested for Alternative B begins by noting that recent 

information indicates that the economy has continued to contract and that, although 

the outlook has improved modestly, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a 

time.  Nonetheless, the statement points out that the policy actions taken recently, 

together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of 

sustainable growth.  The paragraph characterizing the outlook for inflation is identical 

to that in March.  In the third paragraph, the statement reiterates that the Committee 

will use all available tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability.  

It also repeats the Committee’s expectation that the federal funds target rate is likely 

to remain at very low levels for an extended period, and it reminds the markets and 

the public that the FOMC has already decided to purchase large quantities of Treasury 

and agency securities over the course of the year.  The draft statement introduces new 

language to emphasize that the Committee stands ready to adjust the timing and 

overall amounts of these purchases as appropriate; this new sentence aims to 

communicate to the public that monetary policy will be a function of the evolving 

economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The statement then mentions 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 40 of 64



that the Federal Reserve is employing a range of other programs to facilitate the 

extension of credit to households and businesses and to support the functioning of 

financial markets.  As in March, the statement concludes by noting that the 

Committee will monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet in light of economic and financial developments. 

The Committee may prefer a description of its large-scale asset purchases that 

characterizes the path of those purchases in addition to their overall amount.  

Members might believe, for example, that emphasizing the path of purchases would 

better communicate the sense that policymakers have a forward-looking plan for the 

conduct of policy.  If so, Committee members may want to adopt a slightly different 

statement, such as the one suggested under Alternative B´.  This statement is 

identical to the one for Alternative B, except that it adds two sentences in the middle 

of the third paragraph to specify that the Committee expects that the Federal 

Reserve’s holdings of Treasury and agency securities will increase at an average pace 

of about $160 billion per month over the reminder of 2009, which would be 

equivalent to an average monthly growth rate of around 20 percent from the end of 

March through the end of the year.13  This sentence adds information about the 

Committee's expectation for the growth of the securities portfolio over time to a 

statement that maintains the basic structure of those previously released by the 

Committee. 

                                           
13 As of the end of March, there were $782.5 billion of Treasuries, agency debt, and 

mortgage-backed securities on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Of those, $307.2 
billion were securities acquired recently under the announced purchase programs.  
Subtracting that amount from the announced $1.75 trillion of total planned purchases gives 
$1.443 trillion of those securities that still have to be acquired by year-end.  Dividing that 
amount by nine months (April to December) results in a constant monthly purchase rate of 
$160.3 billion, or 20.5 percent of the $782.5 billion of initial holdings.   

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 41 of 64



Judging from the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, very few market participants 

appear to expect an expansion in long-term asset purchases or other significant policy 

actions at this meeting.  Accordingly, the market reaction to the release of a statement 

such as that suggested for Alternatives B or B´ should be muted.  Short- and long-

term yields, stock prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all should 

change little.   

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

If the Committee is concerned that the near-term outlook for economic activity 

might be worse than that presented in the staff forecast and that the subsequent 

recovery might be unduly sluggish, it may prefer to apply additional monetary 

stimulus by expanding its purchases of long-term assets at this meeting, along the lines 

of Alternative A.  The Committee may judge that the signs of economic and financial 

stabilization that were seen over the intermeeting period were quite tentative and that 

significant uncertainties remain as to the timing and extent of the economic recovery, 

perhaps along the lines of the “False Dawn” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  

Alternatively, the Committee might think that the economic outlook presented by the 

staff is quite plausible but unacceptably weak.  While members may be satisfied that 

the purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities already in train are 

having a significant beneficial effect on mortgage rates, they may also view the 

amount of Treasury purchases announced in March as insufficient to have a 

substantial effect on private yields, especially in light of the relatively modest net 

decline in those yields since the March meeting.  Indeed, the relatively small decline 

may have induced members to revise down their estimates of the elasticity of private 

yields to those purchases and to increase their views of the volume of purchases 

necessary to produce a given amount of monetary stimulus.  In addition, the 

Committee may be concerned that the effects on interest rates of the purchases of 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 42 of 64



Treasury securities already planned may be largely offset by the effects of greater 

issuance of such securities to fund a large projected budget deficit.  And members 

may take comfort from the thought that the potential cost of expanding the balance 

sheet through additional acquisitions of Treasury securities may not be high since 

holdings of those securities may be relatively easy to unwind when appropriate, albeit 

perhaps at a capital loss.  

In view of the shallow trajectory of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 

Facility (TALF) to date and the contraction in some other liquidity facilities, some 

members might see the need to take additional action at this meeting to maintain a 

brisk expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Members may believe that the 

recent decline in the usage of some Federal Reserve facilities might not be solely the 

result of improved financial conditions but rather to a significant degree is a 

byproduct of increased stigma associated with those programs that reflects the recent 

conditions imposed on participants in certain government programs.  Similarly, 

members may feel that fears of government actions may undermine the TALF.  

Members may thus view an increase in the purchases of Treasury securities as 

appropriate to offset, at least in part, the reduced policy stimulus generated by existing 

credit facilities.  If members are concerned that the economy will continue to contract 

in the near term and that the recovery will be sluggish, they might also judge that the 

risks that inflation will persist below rates consistent with price stability remain largely 

intact even though recent data have pointed to somewhat higher inflation than had 

been anticipated. 

The first paragraph of the statement that accompanies Alternative A is similar to 

the one for Alternative B, but its description of the economic outlook is more 

downbeat.  It says explicitly that the Committee expects that economic activity will 

continue to contract in the near term and that the subsequent recovery could be 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 43 of 64



sluggish.  Also, it does not refer to the anticipated beneficial effects of previous policy 

actions and monetary and fiscal stimulus.  The paragraph on inflation is virtually 

identical to the one in the March statement.  In the third paragraph, the statement 

announces that the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary stimulus 

by stepping up its purchases of Treasury securities to as much as $750 billion by year 

end—an increase of $450 billion relative to the March decision and an extension of 

the time period over which these purchases will take place.  The rest of the statement 

is identical to that for Alternative B, including language to communicate the 

possibility of future adjustments to the timing and overall amounts of purchases of 

long-term assets in light of the evolving economic outlook and financial market 

conditions, the maintenance of the current range for the federal funds target rate, the 

expectation that short-term rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended 

period, and the references to other liquidity programs and the Committee’s intention 

to monitor the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet carefully.  

Since market participants reportedly see only small odds that the Committee will 

announce a further expansion of its securities purchases at this meeting, it is likely that 

asset prices would move substantially following the release of a statement like that 

accompanying Alternative A.  Treasury and private yields dropped significantly on 

March 18 after the announcement that the Federal Reserve would purchase $300 

billion of Treasury securities and an additional $850 billion in agency debt and 

mortgage-backed securities.  Still, the response of yields to an announcement of 

additional Treasury purchases might be smaller than previously thought (see box 

entitled “Policy Paths for Large Scale Asset Purchases”).  Even though Alternative A 

more than doubles the quantity of Treasury purchases announced in March, the 

immediate response of Treasury and corporate yields may be substantially smaller 

than the one observed after the release of the March statement because that statement 

also announced large increases in the purchases of agency securities.  Keeping in mind 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 44 of 64



that the uncertainty surrounding any judgments regarding the effects of increased 

securities purchases on asset prices is very large, the staff estimates that the 

announcement that the Federal Reserve will purchase an additional $450 billion worth 

of Treasury securities will push down long-term yields between 20 and 45 basis points 

immediately after the announcement.  Equity prices would likely climb, and the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar would decrease.

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

Under the Federal Reserve’s current policy approach, the size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet over the next several years will be driven by the evolution of 

its assets, specifically, the scale of asset purchases and demand for Federal Reserve 

liquidity programs and credit facilities.  The total amount of liabilities will be 

determined by the total quantity of assets, and their composition will be determined 

by the evolution of currency demand and other factors on the liability side with 

reserve balances determined largely as a residual. Two balance-sheet scenarios are 

presented here; they differ in their assumptions regarding asset purchases.  The baseline 

scenario includes only asset purchases that have already been announced by the 

FOMC: the Desk purchases a total of $300 billion of Treasury securities, $200 billion 

of agency securities, and $1,250 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 

this year.  The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in the Policy 

Alternatives section.  In the expanded purchases scenario, which corresponds to 

Alternative A in the Policy Alternatives section, purchases of U.S. Treasuries are 

increased by $450 billion to $750 billion by the end of the year.  

To construct the projections, we had to make assumptions about all 

components of the balance sheet other than reserve balances, which are the residual 

item.  The foreign central bank liquidity swap lines and the Term Auction Facility 

(TAF) are assumed to wind down by year-end 2010 and year-end 2011, respectively, 

as financial markets continue to improve.  The Section 13(3) facilities are assumed to 

be extended beyond October 30, 2009, but they are assumed to run off by the end of 

2010 in a fashion similar to the swaps.  The assets held by Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane 

II, and Maiden Lane III are assumed to be sold over time; they reach zero by 2015.  

In light of the slow initial uptake of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 

(TALF), the facility is assumed to peak at $500 billion—half of the announced 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 46 of 64



$1 trillion limit—at the end of 2010:  The first phase of TALF makes $100 billion of 

3-year loans by the end of 2009; later phases are assumed to make $400 billion of 

3-year loans by the end of 2010.  For large-scale asset purchases, the baseline path of 

purchases matches the assumed path in the Greenbook whereas the expanded 

purchases scenario boosts Treasury purchases; both scenarios assume that the assets 

purchased are held to maturity.  We assume a slower-than-average path for the 

prepayment of MBS that implies that approximately half of the MBS purchases are 

still on the balance sheet in 2016.  On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s 

balance sheet, both scenarios assume that currency (Federal Reserve notes) grows at 

the same rate as the staff forecast for money stock currency through 2010 and 

thereafter expands at the rate of nominal GDP growth in the extended Greenbook 

forecast.  The Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account is projected to wind 

down by the end of 2009, and the U.S. Treasury’s general account returns to its 

historical target level of $5 billion over the same period.  All other liabilities except 

reserve balances are assumed to be constant.14  These projections for liabilities, 

combined with the assumed path for assets, imply a path for reserve balances under 

each scenario.  In both scenarios, the implied level of reserve balances rises rapidly 

until late in 2009, then declines until 2015, at which point we assume that the Desk 

begins conducting open market operations to maintain a level of $25 billion of reserve 

balances for the rest of the projection period. 

Under both scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands rapidly over 

the course of 2009.  For the baseline scenario, the size of the balance sheet reaches 

$3.4 trillion at the end of 2009 and then declines to a level just below $1.4 trillion in 

2015 before beginning to expand again.  The composition of assets differs notably 

from historical patterns.  U.S. Treasury securities account for less than one-quarter of 

                                           
14 More details on the assumptions are provided in Appendix C. 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 47 of 64



 total assets at the end of 2009, and less than half at the end of the projection period, 

whereas prior to August 2007, Treasuries accounted for about 90 percent of assets.  

By the end of the projection period, the alternative path yields the same composition 

and size of the balance sheet as the baseline scenario.  

Projections for the monetary base are derived from these balance-sheet 

projections as the sum of currency in circulation and reserve balances.  Under both 

scenarios, the monetary base expands rapidly in 2009 and into 2010.  In the second 

quarter of 2010, however, as the liquidity facilities are winding down and asset 

purchases have ceased, the monetary base begins to contract; the base continues to 

decline until mid-2016, at which point the stabilized level of reserve balances and the 

continued growth of currency lead to resumed growth in the base.  

The extended Greenbook projection shows the target federal funds rate rising 

from the current 0 to ¼ percent range to 2 percent over the course of 2013.  Under 

the operating procedures employed before the financial crisis, the projected 

end-of-year level of approximately $426 billion of reserve balances would not have 

been consistent with a federal funds rate significantly above zero.  If the interest rate 

paid on excess reserve balances becomes an effective floor on the federal funds rate, a 

higher target rate could be achieved even with quite elevated reserve balances.  The 

experience last autumn, however, suggests that the Desk would likely need to drain 

reserves through open market operations to get the funds rate significantly above 

zero.  This projection for the balance sheet implicitly assumes that alternative 

operating procedures can be put in place to achieve the path for the federal funds rate 

assumed in the Greenbook projection.  If no such operating procedures are available, 

the baseline projection of the balance sheet includes over $600 billion in Treasury 

securities that in principle could be sold by the end of 2013.  In practice, some 

combination of tools, including reverse repurchase agreements, outright sales of  

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 48 of 64



securities, or other strategies, would need to be balanced against potential costs, 

including possible capital losses experienced by the Federal Reserve or disruption to 

markets.  These projections do not assume the statutory authority to issue Fed bills or 

a renewal of the Supplementary Financing Program.

BANK CREDIT, DEBT, AND MONEY FORECASTS 

Bank credit is forecast to decline at about a ¼ percent pace in 2009, largely 

reflecting weakness in core loans so far this year, and to expand at a 4½ percent rate 

in 2010 as economic activity is anticipated to pick up.  C&I loans are projected to 

grow only modestly over the remainder of this year and in 2010, reflecting a 

significant contraction in business fixed investment and weak inventory investment.  

Real estate loans are likely to run off slightly in 2009 but to grow about 3 percent in 

2010 amid a resumption of growth in residential investment.  Consumer loans are 

expected to be about flat in 2009 and to expand at about a 2¼ percent rate in 2010, as 

growth of personal consumption expenditures and nominal GDP picks up.  

Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to expand 4¼ percent in the 

current quarter, about the same pace as in the first quarter.  The level of private-sector 

debt is forecast to decrease in the second quarter as households pay down debt (on 

net) and as borrowing by nonfinancial businesses remains soft.  Amid weak household 

spending, falling home prices, and tight terms and standards for bank loans, 

borrowing by households is expected to remain extremely light through 2010.  

Similarly, borrowing by nonfinancial businesses is projected to remain sluggish 

throughout the forecast period, reflecting weak investment spending, borrowing costs 

that remain relatively high, and tight terms and standards for bank loans.  Federal debt 

will likely continue to expand at a rapid pace through the end of 2010.   

M2 is forecast to expand at an annual rate of 3½ percent in 2009, well above the 

growth rate of nominal GDP, boosted by the lagged effects of declines in opportunity 

cost and ongoing financial market volatility.  In 2010, M2 is expected to decelerate to 

a 2½ percent annual rate, below nominal GDP growth, as some of the unusually rapid 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 52 of 64



accumulation of M2 deposits that resulted from the financial turmoil unwind to some 

degree.

DIRECTIVE 

Draft language for the directive is provided below. 

ALTERNATIVE A 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs 

the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 

during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit 

markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should 

depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment 

of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that the combination 

of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of 

the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The 

Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt by the 

end of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in agency 

MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year and is expected to purchase up to 

$1.25 trillion of these securities by the end of this year.  The Committee also directs 

the Desk to expand the System’s purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to up to 

$750 billion of longer-term Treasury securities.  The System Open Market Account 

Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing 

developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment 

over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

ALTERNATIVE B 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 

during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit 

markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should 

depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment 

of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that the combination 

of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of 

the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The 

Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt by the 

end of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in agency 

MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year and is expected to purchase up to 

$1.25 trillion of these securities by the end of this year.  The Desk is expected to 

purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the third 

quarter.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the 

Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet 

that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability. 

ALTERNATIVE B’ 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the

Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 

during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit 

markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should 

depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment 

of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that the combination 

of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of 

the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The 

Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt by the 

end of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in agency 

MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year and is expected to purchase up to 

$1.25 trillion of these securities by the end of this year.  The Desk is expected to 

purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the third 

quarter.  The Desk is expected to increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury 

and agency securities at an average pace of about $160 billion per month over the 

remainder of 2009.  With the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury and agency 

securities of about $780 billion at the end of March taken as the base, this pace of 

purchases is equivalent to an average monthly growth rate of securities holdings for 

the rest of 2009 of around 20 percent.  The System Open Market Account Manager 

and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments 

regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the 

Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

Appendix A:  Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close 
the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in 
seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in 
the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an 
estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and 
realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the inflation rate is computed 
using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.   

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential 
output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 

 

 

   
 

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output gap, 
the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real bond 
yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run off 
this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the 
future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The TIPS-
based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  
This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based 
on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, 
and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also 
adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis points—between total CPI 
inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix A:  Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate (continued) 
 

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table below 
shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition used in the 
Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; and projected four-
quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each estimate of the real rate, the table 
also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real rate and the average 
actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

Appendix B:  Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter 
ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth 
relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run 
inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over 
the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each rule 
incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point increments 
during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  
The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the 
output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 

FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate agreements, 
and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, 
the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the 
current quarter.

Appendix C:  Long‐run Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base  

This appendix presents in more detail the assumptions underlying the long-run projections of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the monetary base shown in the section entitled “Long-run 
Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

General assumptions 

The projections are constructed at a monthly frequency from May 2009 to December 2016.  The 
few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be constant over the projection 
period at the level reported in the April 16, 2009 Federal Reserve H.4.1 statistical release. The 
projections for all major assets and liabilities are summarized in the charts and table that follow the 
bullet points. 

Assets 

Liquidity and Credit Facilities 

• Primary credit remains unchanged over the rest of 2009 and then falls to $1 billion by the 
end of 2011 and remains at that level thereafter. 

• Term Auction Facility (TAF) credit is assumed to decline with improved market functioning 
and is zero at the end of 2011. 

• Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decline with improved market functioning and are zero 
at the end of 2010. 

• Section 13(3) facilities, except for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), 
are assumed to be extended beyond October 30, 2009.  Credit extended through these 
facilities declines with improved market functioning and is zero at the end of 2010. 

• The TALF, based partly on its slow initial uptake, is assumed to peak at $500 billion, half of 
the $1 trillion limit.  For purposes of these projections, TALF is assumed to consist of two 
components:  TALF 1.0 and TALF 2.0/3.0.  TALF 1.0 issues loans with 3-year maturity and 
reaches $100 billion by the end of 2009.  These loans then all mature and the quantity 
outstanding reaches zero by the end of 2012.  TALF 2.0/3.0 has loans with 3-year maturity 
and reaches $400 billion by the end of 2010.  These loans then all mature and the quantity 
outstanding reaches zero by the end of 2013. 

Asset Purchases 

• In the baseline scenario, only asset purchases that have already been announced are 
incorporated.  The Desk purchases a total of $300 billion of Treasury debt (by September 
2009), $200 billion of agency debt, and $1,250 billion of agency MBS ($500 billion by mid-
year).  The maturity distribution of the Treasury purchases is based on FRBNY Markets 
Group internal forecasts. The maturities of most purchases are between two and ten years, 
with the average being approximately five years.  No sales are assumed but maturing 
securities are redeemed and are not replaced.  As a result, total holdings of Treasury debt 
decline as issues mature.  No assumption is made about the maturation of securities 

April 23, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 61 of 64



previously held in the SOMA portfolio; in other words, they are assumed to be reinvested as 
they mature.  Most of the agency debt being purchased by the Desk is short-term, so 
holdings of these securities are assumed to mature through time.  For MBS, the rate of 
prepayment is based on rough estimates from the Desk.  The historically low coupon on 
these securities implies a relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a result, at the end of 2016, 
$600 billion of the $1.25 trillion purchased remains on the balance sheet. 

•  In the alternative scenario, purchases of U.S. Treasuries are increased by $450 billion to 
$750 billion by the end of the year.  No other changes to the assumptions are made and 
securities mature at the same rate as in the baseline scenario. 

• At the end of the projection period, the expansion of currency combined with a runoff of 
other assets necessitates the resumption of standard open market purchases to maintain 
reserve balances at a level of $25 billion.  It is assumed that the Desk purchases Treasury 
securities over time to satisfy this need. 

Liabilities 

• Currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows in line with the staff forecast for 
money stock currency through the end of 2010.  From 2010 to the end of the projection 
period, currency grows at the rate of nominal GDP as implied by the extended Greenbook 
forecast. 

• The U.S. Treasury’s general account returns to its historical target level of $5 billion by the 
end of 2009.  This account remains constant at that level over the forecast period. 

• The Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account is projected to wind down to zero by the 
end of 2009, and remain at zero for the remainder of the forecast period.  

• Reverse repurchase agreements are expected to decrease to $40 billion by the end of 2010 as 
foreign official and international accounts move to other investments.   

• For most of the projection period, reserve balances of depository institutions are assumed to 
be determined by the evolution of the assets and other liabilities of the Federal Reserve.  As 
the asset side of the balance sheet contracts, so do reserve balances.  When the implied level 
of reserve balances reaches $25 billion, the Desk is assumed to conduct open market 
operations to offset the growth of currency to maintain a constant $25 billion dollar level.
