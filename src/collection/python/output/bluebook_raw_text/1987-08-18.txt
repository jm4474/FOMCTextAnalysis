Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) M2 growth picked up a little in July, although at a 2-3/4 per-

cent annual rate, expansion of this aggregate was less than the Committee's

5 percent path for June to September and fell further below the 5-1/2 percent

lower bound of its 1987 target range. The strengthening of M2 was accounted

for entirely by a turnaround in M1, which edged up at a 1-3/4 percent pace in

July after the substantial runoff in June. Demand deposits declined in July

but at a much reduced rate from June; weakness in these deposits may have

stemed in part from continued reductions in compensating balances and a

further slowing in mortgage refinancing in response to previous increases in

interest rates. Other checkable deposits resumed growth in July, albeit at a

moderate 6-1/4 percent rate, after the nearly unprecedented June decline.

Weekly data for late July and early August suggest that some further strength-

ening of growth in both M1 and M2 is in train this month.

(2) The nontransactions component of M2 decelerated in July.

MMDAs continued to run off and growth of savings deposits slowed substantially

further, as opportunity costs on these more liquid accounts remained consider-

ably wider than in 1986 or early this year. Rates on short-term small time

deposits already had moved into closer alignment with market rates in June,

and yields on longer-term accounts continued to rise in July as the market

yield curve steepened. In response, small time deposits increased at a

12 percent clip in July, a little faster than in June, which ended 13 con-

secutive months of outflows.

(3) M3 expanded at only a 2 percent rate in July, considerably

below the 7-1/2 percent path set at the last Committee meeting, placing this

aggregate just above the bottom of the parallel band associated with its

5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent 1987 target range. Bank credit was flat last month;

with their M2 deposits growing moderately, banks reduced their managed liabil-

ities, including CDs and RPs in M3, and advanced a sizable volume of funds

to their foreign branches, which probably contributed to less aggressive

bidding for Eurodollar deposits and the decline in this component of M3 as

well. At thrifts, on the other hand, overall issuance of large CDs was well

maintained in July, although troubled institutions continued to experience

runoffs of uninsured deposits.

(4) Growth in total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors slowed

in July, largely owing to the disruption to federal financing from the debt

ceiling problem. Early in August, however, the bill auction that had been

omitted in July was made up, and by mid-August, Treasury financing was back

on track with the mid-quarter financing auctions occurring this week for

normal settlement on August 17. Total borrowing by nonfinancial businesses

appears to have eased somewhat in July; bond issuance remained near the

higher June pace, but short-term credit was repaid on balance, with both

business loans at banks and commercial paper outstanding registering declines.

Tax-exempt bond offerings receded somewhat in July, and in early August both

state and local governments and businesses have reduced their long-term bor-

rowing in response to the recent rise in bond yields. In the household sec-

tor, mortgage borrowing has ebbed a bit in recent months, although a sharply

rising ARM share probably has tended to lessen the effects of higher interest

rates. Mortgage lending also has been boosted by the shift from consumer



-4-

credit to home-equity loans, which probably has shaved several percentage

points from consumer installment credit growth this year.

(5) Total reserves continued to decline in July, but at a re-

duced 2 percent annual rate, largely reflecting weakness in transactions

deposits and decreases in excess reserves. The monetary base, which was

essentially flat in June, expanded at a 4-3/4 percent pace in July. The

assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window used

in constructing the nonborrowed reserve path was maintained at $500 million

throughout the intermeeting period. Late in July, in light of slow growth

in the monetary aggregates while the dollar was strengthening, the Account

Manager was resolving uncertainties about reserve provision so that borrowing

would more likely turn out below, rather than above, the path assumption.

Most recently, given signs of strength in the economic expansion, continuing

concerns about price pressures, and a pickup in money growth, the Manager has

returned to a balanced stance of reserve provision. Borrowing for the three

reserve maintenance periods ended since the July 7 FOMC meeting has averaged

$466 million.

(6) The federal funds rate edged off during the intermeeting

period to average around 6-5/8 percent recently. Most other private money

market rates also moved a little lower, but bill rates backed up once the

Treasury was able to complete a full auction schedule and paydowns of bills

in weekly auctions slowed from the pace in the first half of the year. In

capital markets, yields on Treasury and corporate bonds moved higher through

early August, as pressures on oil prices from the Persian Gulf tensions

against a backdrop of reasonably robust economic data and uncertain progress

on the federal deficit seemed to intensify concerns about inflation and credit



-5-

demands in the future. Following the completion of the mid-quarter refund-

ing bond rates have retraced a portion of this rise, but since the last

meeting are up on balance by about 25 to 35 basis points. Apparently spurred

by optimism about the outlook for profits, however, stock prices soared over

the intermeeting period, with major indexes gaining from 6 to 10 percent.

(7) The dollar expanded by 1-1/2 percent on balance over the

intermeeting period against a weighted average of other G-10 currencies. It

rose strongly through much of the period, buoyed by the relative strength of

the U.S. economy and the tensions in the Persian Gulf, but subsequently fell

back in response to the worse-than-expected June trade figures. The dollar

was particularly strong against the mark, perhaps reflecting a sluggish

outlook for the German economy, and by late in the intermeeting period the

dollar-mark exchange rate had recovered to its early 1987 level.

, with

U.S. activity coming to $631 million over the intermeeting period, split

evenly between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.

. Money market conditions tightened somewhat in Germany

and more in the United Kingdom, while remaining unchanged in Japan. Long-

term rates rose significantly in all these countries, with the largest rise

occurring in Japan amid improved prospects for economic activity as well as

concerns about the inflation implications of mid-East tensions.



Policy alternatives

(8) The table below presents three alternative specifications for

monetary growth from June to September, along with associated federal funds

rate ranges. (More detailed data, including growth from July to September

and from the fourth-quarter base of the long-run ranges to September implied

under each alternative, are shown on the table and charts on the following

pages.)

M3 5-3/4 5-1/2 5-1/4
M1 5 4 3

Associated federal
funds rate range 3 to 7 4 to 8 5 to 9

(9) Alternative B is based on retaining $500 million of adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing as the assumption in constructing reserve paths.

Federal funds would be likely to trade mainly in the lower portion of a

6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent range, except perhaps around the mid-September corpo-

rate tax date, when unusually large payments may impart some temporary upward

pressure to the funds rate. With no major changes in supply anticipated, at

least until the time of the next expiration of the Treasury debt ceiling on

September 23, Treasury bill rates now seem broadly consistent with a federal

funds rate continuing to average a little above 6-1/2 percent. Likewise,

other money market rates generally should vary around current levels under

alternative B. Longer-term rates also are most likely to fluctuate near

-8-

recent levels into the late summer, though they should remain sensitive

to developments in the Persian Gulf and other factors bearing on the

inflation outlook and the dollar.

(10) Under alternative B, and the other alternatives as well, M2

growth is projected to strengthen in August and September relative to the

weak expansion of recent months. This pickup would reflect primarily a

waning of the damping influence of previous increases in market rates and

opportunity costs. Offering rates on very liquid deposits now seem roughly

in line with the current levels of short-term market rates; however, some

additional upward adjustment in rates on longer-term small time deposits

probably can be expected, given recent increases in yields on market instru-

ments of comparable maturity. With opportunity costs unchanged or narrowing

a bit under this alternative, growth in M2 over the balance of the quarter

is expected to average near 6 percent, around the trend of income. This

growth would bring expansion over June to September to the 5 percent short-

run growth path specified by the Committee at its last meeting. Owing to

its recent weakness, largely reflecting the earlier widening of opportunity

costs, M2 would expand this quarter at only a 3-1/4 percent annual rate on

a quarterly average basis. Given the staff's greenbook projection for nominal

GNP, M2 velocity would be expected to increase at a 3 percent rate, around

the pace of the first half of the year.

(11) M3 growth over August and September would be expected to

accelerate substantially from its unusually depressed July pace, to a rate

of 7 percent under alternative B. Bank credit should resume its expansion,

boosting issuance of large CDs. Demand for adjustable rate mortgages likely

will continue to support thrift asset growth, funded in part by continued



-9-

expansion of large CDs, especially if the recent tendency to pull back from

reliance on FHLB advances continues. Even with the pickup in M3 growth, this

aggregate would fall short of the Committee's current 7-1/2 percent short-run

range for June to September by about 2 percentage points. Total debt of

nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow in August and September around the

more moderate July pace, leaving the debt aggregate in September about 9-1/2

percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base. While federal

government borrowing has picked up following the debt ceiling disruption,

private credit demands may be damped a bit, especially in long-term credit

markets in response to the higher level of bond yields.

(12) Moderate increases in M1 also are expected over the balance

of the quarter as interest-rate effects recede. Since mid-July, growth of

both demand deposit balances and NOW accounts has resumed, and expansion of

M1 at a 5-1/4 percent rate is expected on average over August and September

under alternative B. But the arithmetic effect of weakness in June and July

implies quarterly average growth of less than 1 percent in the current quarter

and a velocity increase of almost 6 percent, the largest advance since early

1984.

(13) With respect to the long-run ranges, M2 growth from the

fourth quarter to September is expected to come to only 4-1/4 percent under

alternative B. Expansion at around an 11-1/2 percent rate over September to

December would be required to hit the lower end of the long-run range in the

fourth quarter; 9-1/2 percent growth would be needed to bring this aggregate

to the lower end of its growth cone in December. While a further strengthen-

ing of M2 growth is possible over the fourth quarter should some of the

unusual weakness of earlier this year be reversed, an acceleration of this



-10-

magnitude would seem unlikely without a very substantial decline in interest

rates by early in the fourth quarter. M3 growth from its fourth-quarter

base would be at a 5-1/4 percent rate by September under alternative B.

With moderate increases in bank and thrift credit projected, this aggregate

is likely to climb to within the lower portion of its range in the fourth

quarter, even if interest rates moved a little higher in the latter part of

the year, as in the staff forecast. Nonfinancial debt is still expected to

grow 9-1/2 percent in 1987 on a quarterly average basis, in the middle of

its 8 to 11 percent range. Growth of M1 from the fourth quarter of 1986 to

September is projected at 6-1/2 percent under alternative B; with rates re-

maining close to current levels under this alternative through the third

quarter, M1 growth for the year is not likely to differ very much from its

growth through September.

(14) Alternative A assumes adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of

$300 million would be used to construct reserve paths. The federal funds

rate would fall to within a 6 to 6-1/4 percent range, probably gravitating

toward the lower end once the market perceived the extent of the easing of

reserve pressures. Other short-term rates would follow suit, with the 3-

month Treasury bill rate probably slipping to around 5-1/2 percent. Given

the easing of reserve pressures under this alternative, against the back-

ground of recent signs of monetary policy firming in some other major indus-

trial countries, the dollar probably would come under renewed downward pres-

sure. Bond market participants, recently preoccupied with inflationary con-

cerns, might react negatively to a less restrictive stance of Federal Reserve

policy, especially should it be accompanied by a substantial weakening of the

dollar. In such circumstances, bond yields might not fall much, if at all,

over the intermeeting period, absent a sharp break in oil prices.



-11-

(15) Owing to the decline of short-term market interest rates

relative to offering rates on deposits, M2 growth under alternative A would

be expected to jump to 7 percent over August and September. Its M1 component

likely would accelerate to a 6-3/4 percent rate over the two months. Growth

of M2 would move noticeably closer to its long-term range, but in September

this aggregate still would have increased at only a 4-1/2 percent annual rate

from its fourth-quarter base. While the easing contemplated under this

alternative probably would have a pronounced effect on money growth in the

fourth quarter, whether M2 could hit the 5-1/2 percent lower bound of its

range without a further easing is uncertain. To make up the shortfall, a

10-1/2 percent September-to-December growth rate would be needed (or 8-3/4

percent to hit the bottom of the growth cone by December). For M3, the 7-1/2

percent growth foreseen for August and September under alternative A would

lift this aggregate to around the lower bound of its annual range. Prospects

would be good that the aggregate would move well within its range in the

fourth quarter; the steeper yield curve expected under this alternative would

provide additional incentives for businesses to focus credit demands on banks

and for home mortgage credit to be met through ARMs at thrifts.

(16) Alternative C assumes an increase in the reserve path allow-

ance for discount window borrowing to $700 million. Federal funds probably

would trade in a 7 to 7-1/4 percent range and bill rates would move commensu-

rately higher. A near-term firming of monetary policy does not now seem

widely anticipated and long-term rates probably would tend to rise under this

alternative. However, any such backup might be limited if such a policy

action were seen as indicative of continued Federal Reserve commitment to

restraining inflation. The dollar's recent firmness in exchange markets

would be more likely to persist, at least for a time.



-12-

(17) The backup in short-term market rates under alternative C,

together with lagging returns on deposits, would widen opportunity costs of

holding liquid monetary assets. Expansion of M2 over August and September

would be expected to average 5-1/4 percent, bringing growth from the fourth

quarter through September to around 4 percent. Given the continuing effects

of the rise in interest rates, this aggregate would be unlikely to accelerate

much in the fourth quarter. The 6-3/4 percent growth anticipated for M3 over

the last two months of this quarter would imply that growth of this aggregate

from the fourth quarter base to September would be around 1/4 percentage

point below the lower limit of its 1987 range. Even so, this aggregate

could climb to the lower end of its range in the fourth quarter, assuming

continued moderate expansion of assets at depository institutions. M1

might expand at only a 3 percent rate from June to September under this

alternative, with growth for the year decelerating further to 6-1/4 percent

by September, and dropping noticeably below 6 percent for the year.



-13-

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

options for alternative specifications of reserve pressures, is presented be-

low for Committee consideration. With regard to the language on intermeeting

adjustments, the draft provides for the usual options regarding the symmetry

or asymmetry of such adjustments with appropriate use of "would" or "might,"

and "somewhat" or "slightly".

If the Committee wished to change the implicit weighting of the

various factors conditioning intermeeting reserve adjustments, it could

shift or delete the language in the first two sets of brackets. For example,

if the Committee wished to retain the current added emphasis on resisting

inflation but to reduce that on the dollar in light of its recent strength,

it might shift the "as well as" expression to before the reference to the

foreign exchange market. Alternatively, it could delete the language in both

brackets to give the various factors more equal weight.

The language in the third set of brackets is suggested should the

Committee wish to indicate that somewhat faster growth in M2 and M3 than

currently expected would be acceptable, under certain conditions, given

their shortfall from the long-run ranges, which would be expected to persist

through the third quarter under any of the alternatives.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE

SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.

Somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT), or somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT), be acceptable depending



-14-

on indications of inflationary pressures [and on] developments in foreign

exchange markets, [as well as] the behavior of the aggregates and the strength

of the business expansion. This approach is expected to be consistent with

growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual

rates around 5 ____ and [DEL: 7-1/2] ____ percent, respectively. [SOMEWHAT FASTER

GROWTH IN THE BROAD AGGREGATES WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE ABSENCE OF INDI-

CATIONS OF WORSENING PRICE PRESSURES AND SUBSTANTIAL WEAKNESS IN THE DOLLAR,

GIVEN THE SHORTFALL OF THESE AGGREGATES FROM THEIR ANNUAL RANGES.] Growth

in M1, while picking up from recent levels, is expected to remain well below

its pace during 1986. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if

it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions

during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with

a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO ____

percent.
