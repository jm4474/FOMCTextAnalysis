preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) For April and May combined, growth in reserves available to suppor)

private nonbank deposits (RPD)--at a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate 1/ --appears to be

within the 7--11 per cent range targeted for this period by the Committee, as

shown in the attached Table 1. While revised RPD figures have been published,

the data shown in Table 1 are based on the old series since this was the yard-

stick used by the Committee and the Desk. The old figures are compared with

the new revised RPD series in the Appendix beginning on page 12.

(2) Growth rates of M1 and M2 were both close to the 8 per cent

annual rates desired by the Committee in April. However, expansion in the

adjusted credit proxy--at nearly a 14 per cent annual rate --was substantially

above the rate projected as being consistent with these money supply growth

rates at the last meeting. The unexpected strength in the proxy reflected

greater than anticipated strength in both Government deposits and large CD's.

(3) In May, with Government deposits continuing to increase--instead

of dropping sharply as projected--the unexpectedly large expansion in the proxy

has persisted. Growth in M1, on the other hand, fell substantially short of

expectations in the first two weeks of May, perhaps reflecting post-tax date

clearances of April personal income tax checks, which appear

1/ Data on RPD are actuals for the period through May 17. Of course, for the
succeeding two weeks of the month only required reserves against private nonbank
deposits are available (on a lagged accounting basis), and required reserve
figures for the final week of the month are still a preliminary estimate.

to have been both unusually heavy and unusually slow this year. Preliminary

data for the week ending May 17 indicate a large resurgence in M1 growth--as

might be expected once the negative effect of delayed tax clearance subsided.

Even assuming that the recent higher level of M1 is confirmed by final data

and then maintained over the rest of the month, M1 growth for all of May may be

no greater than a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate, considerably below the 8-1/2 per

cent rate thought likely at the time of the last Committee meeting. M2 in May,

on the other hand, appears to be running somewhat ahead of expectations, as

growth of time deposits other than large CD's turned stronger than anticipated.

(4) Over the four-statement-week period ending May 17, the Federal

funds rate averaged close to 4-1/4 per cent, about one-eighth of a percentage

point above the average for the preceding four weeks. Most recently, the

average for the week of May 17 was 4.32 per cent. These rates are in the

lower part of the 4--5 per cent range thought at the time of the last meeting

to be consistent with growth in RPD at the mid-point of the targeted range.

One factor that may have kept the funds rate from rising more in the period

was a drop in the overnight Eurodollar rate as compared with earlier weeks,

further widening the distance of the Eurodollar below the funds rate. There

is some evidence that this differential has induced a flow of funds into the

U. S. market, particularly through agencies of foreign banks.

(5) Both short- and long-term interest rates moved down following

the last Committee meeting, largely in reaction to the terms of the Treasury

May refunding and to the changed outlook for Treasury financing. The net



-3-

repayment of debt announced for the Treasury's refinancing, the continuing

very high level of the cash balance, and reports by Treasury officials that

second half cash needs would probably be much smaller than previously indicated,

all contributed to a marked downward revision in market judgments about the

likely pressure from Treasury borrowing in the months just ahead. Most

recently, there has been some tendency for rates to rise again, particularly

in the Treasury bill market. Key factors in the recent bill rate rise have

been the uncreep in the average rate on Federal funds and next week's bunching

of the monthly and two weekly bill auctions in a 5-day period. Also, the timing

of certain recent bill sales by the Desk, for System and other official accounts,

was interpreted by market participants as evidence that Federal policy makers

wanted bill rates-to rise. Currently, the 3-month Treasury bill is trading

around 3.80 per cent--somewhat above its level at the time of the last

Committee meeting and well above the 3.42 per cent low reached in early May

just after the Treasury refinancing.

of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods.

Prospective developments

money market conditions are summarized below for Committee considera-

tion. More detailed monthly and quarterly figures, including data for

total reserves and RPD, are shown on the next two pages.

(8) Of the three alternatives presented, alternative A involves

money market conditions closest to those most recently prevailing. The mid-

point of the Federal funds rate range for A is around 4-1/4--4-1/2 per cent.

Under this alternative, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a

3-3/8--4-1/4 per cent range between now and the next meeting of the Committee,

and to move above the upper end in the summer.

(9) The bill rate is likely to be under downward pressure from

market forces over the near-term, as the Treasury is expected to repay almost

$4 billion of publicly-held issues maturing in June. Board staff projections

indicate the Treasury is likely to have to borrow a sizable amount of new

money--perhaps around $8 billion--in July and August, but projections by the

Treasury suggest a considerably smaller cash need. The market at the moment

seems to be assuming a cash need close to our estimates, and anticipation of

such a need could serve to offset downward pressure on the bill rate as June

progresses, as could possible net sales of bills from foreign accounts.

But the principal source of near-term upward pressure on bill rates would be a

tendency for the Federal funds rate to edge up from recent levels. This would

be particularly likely under alternatives B and C, but even could occur under

alternative A. If demands for bank reserves and for money are not as strong

as assumed, however, the funds rate and other short-term rates would, of

course, be correspondingly reduced for any given rate of bank reserve provision.

(10) The demand for money is expected to remain strong largely

because of the substantial 11--11-1/2 per cent annual rate of growth projected

for nominal GNP in the second and third quarters. Both rates of growth are

larger than projected by the staff at the last FOMC meeting. With sizable

transactions demands, efforts to move onto a slower growth path for monetary

aggregates--as in alternatives B and C--are likely to involve additional upward

pressures on short-term interest rates, with such pressures particularly strong

under alternative C. In June and July, the projected sharp drop in the Treasury

balance will tend temporarily to accelerate growth in M1. This reflects pushing

forward by one month the sharp drop in the Treasury balance that had been

anticipated for May but did not develop.



(11) For alternative B, the mid-point of the Federal funds

rate range is just under 5 per cent. If the rate were to move up toward

that area, this would clearly impart upward impetus to other short-term

rates and bring expectations of a possible increase in the 4-1/2 per

cent discount rate increasingly into the thinking of market participants.

We would expect the 3-month bill rate under this alternative to be in a

3-7/8--5-1/4 per cent range between now and the next Committee meeting.

Under alternative C, the bill rate could move higher more quickly. As

noted earlier, however, there is considerable uncertainty about whether

Treasury cash needs over the next three months will be as large as assum-

ed in our projections; this makes the size and timing of upward movements

in interest rates more than usually uncertain.

(12) Inflows to banks of time deposits other than large CD's

are expected to moderate over the months ahead from their rather rapid

May pace. Moderation should be most noticeable after mid-year, though,

when short-term market interest rates are most likely to be rising signif-

icantly. Under alternative A, we would expect the rate of growth in such

deposits in the third quarter to drop to around 9 per cent, somewhat below

the expected second quarter pace, and about half the first quarter rate.

Under alternatives B and C, the rate of growth would likely be substantially

smaller. This would be particularly so under the money market conditions

expected to be consistent with alternative C aggregates. Short-term market

rates in the third quarter under those circumstances are likely to be above

most current ceiling rates on consumer-type time deposits.



-10-

(13) A declining trend of net saving inflows to nonbank

institutions would also be expected by the third quarter. While these

institutions have somewhat higher ceiling rates than banks, competitive-

ness of their deposits would, of course, be diminished as the 3-month

bill rate advances. Competitiveness would be severely eroded if the

bill rate moved into a 5-1/2--6 per cent range.

(14) Banks are expected to be relatively aggressive in offer-

ing large negotiable CD's, Strong loan expansion--with business loans

expected to continue rising at around the rate of the past few months--

in conjunction with diminishing net inflow of funds from consumer-type

time deposits are likely to encourage bank demand for CD funds. If

short-term rates rise into the alternative C range, we would expect that

banks would have to rely particularly heavily on large CD's as interest

rate ceilings constrain consumer-type time deposit inflows.

(15) Longer-term interest rates are not likely to be subject

to upward interest rate pressures from the demand side over the next few

months. The volume of corporate bonds coming to market appears to be

abating somewhat further, and mortgage credit demands seem to be topping

out. Market expectations appear to have shifted to an assumption of

relative rate stability over the next few months, but expectations could

change abruptly if money market conditions firm. Expectations might not

change to any significant degree under alternative A but would shift more

markedly if short-term market conditions move into the ranges associated

with B and C.



-11-

Proposed directive

(16) Possible language for the operational paragraph of the

directive is given below. The three alternative adjectives qualifying

"growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead" might be taken to

correspond with the similarly lettered patterns of aggregate growth

rates described in the preceding section.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of

capital market developments and the forthcoming Treasury

financing,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
(A - MODERATE )

money market conditions that will support (B - somewhat more moderate)
(C - MORE MODERATE )

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

Deletion of the reference to capital market developments is proposed in

light of the recent and prospective moderation of credit demands in secur-

ities markets. The Committee may wish, however, to consider including the

capital markets reference--particularly under alternative C and possibly

B--in view of the possibility under these alternatives that strong upward

rate pressures could develop in longer-term markets.

APPENDIX

Revised RPD Data

On May 18, the RPD series was released to the public; the series

will now appear weekly in two Board statistical releases and monthly in the

Bulletin. Weekly and monthly data are available back through 1960. The

published seasonally adjusted series differs somewhat from the previously

available internal figures as a result of technical adjustments undertaken in

the course of a thorough methodological review.

While, as before, seasonally adjusted RPD is based on seasonally

adjusted deposit aggregates, two technical adjustments were made to the data.

First, required reserve ratios were aggregated from micro data in order to adjust

ratios for the distribution of deposits below and above $5 million at each

bank, reflecting differences in reserve requirements. This changed the level

of the RPD series by about $30 million on average. Second, required reserves

for private demand and total time and savings deposits were calculated directly. 1/

In the old series, required reserves for net interbank and Treasury deposits

had been subtracted from total reserves to calculate RPD. 2/ This different

method of calculation reduced the level of RPD by about $350 million on

average.

As indicated in the first three columns of the table on the next

page, the level of the new series is lower than for the old series.

1/ To this total are added required reserves for nondeposit funds and
excess reserves to obtain RPD.
2/ In the old series, average demand deposit reserve ratios were used,
However, because of the distribution of interbank deposits by class of bank,
the required reserve ratio applicable to interbank deposits is considerably
different from the average reserve ratio.

However, seasonally adjusted annual rates of change, shown in columns 5 and 6,

are not very different over quarters or even two month periods (see lines 6, 7,

8 and 9 of the table). For example, in the first quarter of 1972, the old series

increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11.3 per cent, while the new

series show a 10.8 per cent rate of growth.

Some month-to-month annual rates of change do show significant

differences between the two series, particularly in January and February of this

year. During the February-March period the new seasonally adjusted annual rate

of increase is a little above the target range, whereas under the old series it
