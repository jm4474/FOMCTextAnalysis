Recent developments

(1) M 1 increased at a record 19¾ per cent annual rate in

April, and growth for the April-May period is projected at a 12¼

per cent annual rate--2¼ percentage points above the upper end of the

Committee's desired range. M 2 appears to be expanding at about a 9.1

per cent annual rate over April and May, below the mid-point of the

Committee's range, reflecting a further moderation in the growth of

the interest bearing component of this aggregate. Nonborrowed

reserves expanded substantially in April, reflecting the sharp

expansion of demand deposits early in the month, but are likely

to show little net change on balance in May, partly in lagged

response to recent declines in demand deposits.

(2) In response to very rapid growth of M1 in the early weeks

of April, the Desk became somewhat less generous in its provision of non-

borrowed reserves in the statement week following the April FOMC meeting,

expecting the Federal funds rate to average 4-3/4 per cent or slightly

higher. Over following statement weeks, the Desk raised its funds rate

target first to around 5 per cent and then to around 5-1/4 per cent, as

incoming data indicated that M1 was apparently growing at rates well

above the Committee's range, while M2 growth was near the mid-point of

its range. In the latest statement week the funds rate averaged 5.31

per cent. With the rise in the funds rate, member bank borrowing at the

discount window has increased since the April FOMC meeting to averages

of $214 million and $154 million, respectively, in the last two statement

weeks.

(3) Since the April FOMC meeting short-term market rates

generally have increased by around 1/2 percentage point, and most recently,

a number of major banks have raised the prime loan rate from 6-1/4 per

cent to 6-1/2 per cent. Business demands for short-term funds have been

quite strong over this period. Business loans at banks increased at a

12-1/4 per cent annual rate in April--exceeding the rapid first quarter

pace--and commercial paper issued by finance companies and nonfinancial

corporations expanded more sharply than in any month since 1974. Upward

pressures on short-term rates, however, were tempered by the improved

Treasury financial position which has permitted a paydown of Treasury bills

amounting to $4.5 billion thus far in the second quarter.



(4) Long-term interest rates have increased from 10 to

20 basis points since the April FOMC meeting. Upward pressures on

long rates have been moderated by a significant cutback in publicly

offered corporate bonds--though both private placements of corporate

issues and bonds issued by municipalities have remained relatively

large. In addition, the Treasury paid down debt of around $400 million

in its mid-May refunding and has announced an additional run-off of

$500 million in the 2-year notes scheduled to be refinanced right

after the May FOMC meeting.

(5) In its May refunding the Treasury reopened securities

first issued in last February's refunding, auctioning $2.85 billion of

7¼ per cent 6¾ year notes and $1.0 billion of 7-5/8 per cent 29¾ year

bonds. Bidding in the auctions for both issues was relatively aggressive

and average auction rates were set within a few basis points of levels

on outstanding issues. Dealers have distributed essentially all of

their awards, and both new offerings are currently quoted at close to

issue price.

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial

Prospective developments

(7) Summarized below for Committee consideration are

alternative short-run operating specifications for the monetary

aggregates and the Federal funds rate. (Detailed data are shown in

the tables on pp. 6 and 7).

M2  4-8 3½-7½ 2¾-6¾

(8) Under all alternatives, we expect M1 growth to slow

markedly over the next several weeks from the April pace. The

extremely large M1 expansion last month appears to have provided

the public with sufficient cash to accommodate much of their increased

transactions needs in the second quarter, when nominal GNP is pro-

jected to expand at about a 14 per cent annual rate. A growth range of

1 to 5 per cent for the May-June period is projected under alternative

B, assuming the Federal funds rate remains around 5¼ per cent--the mid-

point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent range. For the second quarter as a whole,

M1 growth would be around a 9¼ per cent annual rate, well above the

4.8 per cent rate of the first quarter.

(9) Under alternative B, we would expect M2 to expand in

a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range in the May-June period. The time

and savings deposit component of M 2 is expected to expand somewhat

more rapidly over the weeks ahead than during the recent past.

In the course of April, growth in consumer-type time and savings

deposits appears to have been restrained by relatively large nonwith-

held tax payments by individuals. Still, growth in the weeks ahead

is likely to be slower than the pace during the first quarter in view

of the higher level of short- and intermediate-term market rates now

prevailing.

(10) It appears that market rates have largely adjusted to

a Federal funds rate of around 5¼ per cent. However, some further

minor upward adjustments in market rates could develop between now and

the next Committee meeting even if the funds rate remains unchanged.

The Treasury may not be in a position to continue paying off bills

in the weekly and monthly auctions after the end of May, and private

short-term credit demands are expected to remain generally strong.

If the upward adjustments that have already occurred in the commercial

paper rate are sustained, a further rise in the bank prime rate is

possible within the next few weeks.

(11) We would expect the funds rate and other interest

rates, particularly short-term rates, to rise substantially after mid-

year, as the demands for money and credit continue to be generally

strong and the Treasury once again becomes a sizable net borrower.

By the first quarter of 1978, the staff anticipates a funds rate of

around 7 per cent under alternative B, if M1 growth is to be near the

mid-point of the Committee's 4 -6 per cent range for the QI'77-QI'78



-9-

period. This is a somewhat higher funds rate than the funds rate

projected for the first quarter of 1976 in the previous bluebook.

This upward revision reflects the need for greater restraint in M

growth over the last three quarters of the target period in view of

the 9¼ per cent annual growth rate in M1 now expected for the second

quarter. With the somewhat higher interest rates anticipated,

inflows of interest-bearing deposits in M 2 and M3 would probably

slow, and growth in these aggregates over the QI '77-QI '78 period may

be around the lower ends of their longer run ranges.

(12) Alternative C contemplates a tightening in money

market conditions over the next few weeks while alternative A involves

an easing. Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would be expected

to rise to the mid-point of a 5¼-6¼ per cent range. This may be a

accompanied by growth in M1 in the May-June period at an annual rate

in a range of ½-4½ per cent--about ½ point slower than under alternative

B. The immediate retarding effect on M2 is expected to be somewhat

greater under alternative C. With the funds rate rising to around 5¾

per cent, the 3-month bill rate may adjust up to the 5½-5¾ per cent

area. Such a substantial further rise in short-term rates to a level

well above the ceiling rate on savings deposits is likely to trigger a

sizable outflow of savings funds to market instruments.

(13) The increases in short-term rates under alternative C

would probably also be accompanied by a fairly prompt return to ceiling

rates on time deposits at those banks and thrift institutions that



had lowered offering rates previously. Banks may also begin to

press CD offerings more consistently on the market, partly to lock

in funds at current interest costs. Depository institutions are

likely to raise their lending rates on business loans and mortgages.

Moreover--with outstanding mortgage commitments at record levels--

thrifts are likely to become considerably more cautious in making

new commitments. In bond markets, rates may show some increase, but

these increases may be limited by the continued large volume of

institutional funds seeking long-term outlets and by any effect that

a tightening of the money market may have in dampening inflationary

expectations.

(14) An immediate tightening of the money market, such as

is called for under alternative C, would probably reduce somewhat the

level to which the funds rate would have to rise ultimately to restrain

monetary growth to within the FOMC's longer-run ranges. We would

expect the funds rate to peak at around 6¾ per cent in the winter of

this year.

(15) The near-term easing of the money market under

alternative A would probably stimulate a substantial rally in debt

markets, particularly in light of the sizable short position of U.S.

Government security dealers in coupon issues. The staff would not

expect any decline in the funds rate to be sustainable, given the

strong growth in nominal GNP that is projected. A subsequent rather

sharp rise in the funds rate would seem to be required under the cir-

cumstances to keep monetary growth rates within their longer-run ranges.

Directive language

(16) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs

of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive adopted at

the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of growth in

monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications

adopted at the last meeting (except that the upper limit shown for the

funds rate range--5-1/2 per cent--reflects the modification agreed upon

on May 6). The second formulation places main emphasis on money market

conditions. As suggested below, the particular language needed in the

opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific

conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively,

for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market condi-

tions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed

in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in

M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preced-

ing paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual

growth rates over the [DEL: April-May] MAY-JUNE period to be within the

ranges of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and [DEL: 8 to 12]

____ to ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Com-

mittee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly

average Federal funds rate of about [DEL: 4-3/4] ____ per cent. If,



-12-

giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that

growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly

from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objec-

tive for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of [DEL: 4-1/2 to 5-1/2] ____ to ____

per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier

or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be

growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are

believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-

run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding para-

graph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly

average Federal funds rate at about ____ per cent, so long

as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the May-June period

period at annual rates within ranges of ____ to ____ per

cent and ____ to ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving



-13-

approximately equal weight to M-l and M-2, it appears that growth

rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the

limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the

weekly average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

annual rate. The growth in nonborrowed reserves is above, and the

growth in total reserves below, longer-run growth rates shown for

these reserve aggregate measures in the table above. Growth of

nonborrowed reserves is expected to moderate in the months ahead as

the System provides less reserves through Desk operations and banks

borrow more through the discount window. Demand for borrowings is

expected to be greater over the months ahead, given the present

discount rate and expectations of a rising Federal funds rate, and

growth in total reserves may be accelerating somewhat. Growth in the

monetary base has averaged 7.0 per cent thus far in the second quarter,

near the longer-run growth rate shown for this aggregate.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase

agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
