MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) On the eve of the August FOMC meeting, market participants were 

confident—but not completely certain—that the Committee would leave the funds 

rate at 5¼ percent.  As a result, the announcement of the decision to put policy on 

hold after seventeen consecutive firmings pulled policy expectations a few basis 

points lower (Chart 1).1  Those expectations subsequently fell further in response to 

softer-than-expected inflation data for July, declines in oil prices, and the minutes of 

the August FOMC meeting, which were interpreted as underscoring that Committee 

members generally saw price pressures as likely to abate amid moderating economic 

growth.  Futures quotes indicate that investors generally believe that the target rate 

will be left unchanged at the September meeting and over the remainder of the year.  

Further ahead, futures rates now imply about 50 basis points of easing next year and 

point to a funds rate of about 4½ percent at the end of 2008.  Respondents to the 

Desk’s survey of primary dealers also expect policy easing next year, albeit somewhat 

less than that apparent in futures prices.  In addition, the dealers anticipate little 

change in the wording of the September FOMC statement.  Implied volatilities 

derived from options on Eurodollars futures contracts that expire over the coming 

two years remain near the low end of their historical ranges. 

(2) Yields on two- and five-year nominal Treasury securities fell about 10 basis 

points over the intermeeting period.  By contrast, yields on similarly dated indexed 

debt rose, leaving near- and intermediate-term TIPS-based inflation compensation 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged near its intended level over the intermeeting 
period.  During the period, the Desk purchased $4 billion of Treasury coupon securities in 
the market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased by $1 billion, to 
$13 billion.

considerably lower.  The appreciable decline in energy prices—spot oil prices fell by 

$13 per barrel, on net—and the shortfall of readings on inflation relative to what 

markets had anticipated apparently led investors to trim their expectations for near-

term inflation, which is evident in the pronounced decline in short-run inflation 

compensation (see the box “Short-run Inflation Compensation”).  Further out the 

yield curve, one-year nominal and real forward rates ending in ten years were down a 

little, implying only small changes in inflation compensation at that horizon.2 

(3) Against the backdrop of lower oil prices, broad stock price indexes 

increased about 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period (Chart 2).  Implied 

volatility of the S&P 500 declined, and spreads of yields on investment- and 

speculative-grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities edged 

down.  Corporate risk spreads are narrow by historical standards, consistent with 

continued solid credit quality and very low expected defaults for the coming year. 

(4) The trade-weighted index of the dollar versus major foreign currencies rose 

about ¾ percent on net over the intermeeting period, as modest increases against the 

euro and sterling and a larger advance relative to the yen were partially offset by a 

small decline vis-à-vis the Canadian dollar (Chart 3).3  Nominal yields on long-term 

government securities in industrial countries moved down 10 to 20 basis points over 

the period, while yields on indexed debt were little changed.  As a result, most of the 

decline in nominal yields was concentrated in the inflation-compensation component, 

as market participants appear to have revised inflation expectations down in reaction 

to the recent drop in oil prices.  In Japan, softer data on inflation and activity led 

investors to trim their expectation of policy tightening by the Bank of Japan, and that

economic growth can be found in the box at the end of this section.

 fall Short-Run Inflation Compensation  
 
The inaugural TIPS issue, which was sold in 1997, will mature in January 2007.  The 
rich schedule of issuance since then provides numerous points along the indexed-debt 
yield curve at short and intermediate maturities.  The amount of interest and principal 
that will be paid on the TIPS issue maturing in January 2007 will be determined by the 
average of the CPIs for October and November, making it relatively straightforward 
to calculate inflation compensation for the twelve months ending that period.  More 
generally, quotes on indexed debt maturing in January in each of the next three years 
can be matched up with quotes from the nominal yield curve to generate estimates of 
annual inflation compensation ending in October-November for the next two years as 
well. 
 
The chart below shows that these measures of short-run inflation compensation 
shifted lower over the intermeeting period.  The implied rate for the one-year period 
ending this autumn fell about 70 basis points to 2.45 percent,* and the rates for 
similar intervals ending in 2007 and 2008 fell 5 and 15 basis points, respectively, to 
2.80 and 2.45 percent. 
 

  
 
* CPI up to July 2006 has been published, and as a result, most of the inflation compensation from 
October-November 2005 to October-November 2006 is already known.  According to the 
methodology employed here, the unknown portion for that period—that is, the implied monthly 
average seasonally adjusted inflation compensation between July and November 2006—is 
0.06 percentage point.

weighed on the foreign exchange value of the yen.  Stock price indexes in most major 

industrial countries rose between 1 and 5 percent over the period. 

(5) On balance over the intermeeting period, the dollar was about unchanged 

against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  The Mexican 

peso edged down only slightly versus the dollar, despite lingering uncertainty created 

by the recent presidential election in that country.  The Brazilian real moved up against 

the dollar.  EMBI+ spreads for both Brazil and Mexico remained near record lows.  

The heavily managed dollar-renminbi exchange rate moved in a wider daily range over 

the intermeeting period than earlier this year, and the currency appreciated 3⁄10 percent 

on net.  Some analysts interpreted the larger fluctuations as a possible prelude to 

greater flexibility of the renminbi.  The People’s Bank of China increased its 

benchmark bank lending rate 27 basis points on August 18, pointing to the rapid 

growth of credit and investment. 

(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to be increasing at a 

6½ percent rate in the current quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter, 

as a projected slowing in household borrowing about offsets a more-rapid expansion 

of federal debt (Chart 4).  C&I loans have picked up briskly in recent months, but net 

corporate bond issuance has slowed.  On balance, growth of nonfinancial business 

sector debt this quarter is expected to remain near its second-quarter pace.  Debt of 

the household sector expanded at a 9 percent annual rate last quarter, slightly slower 

than in the first quarter, as mortgage borrowing moderated a bit.  The limited 

indicators for the current quarter, including July and August bank credit data, point to 

some further slowing of household mortgage borrowing, consistent with the cooling 

in the housing market. 

(7) M2 growth, at a 4 percent annual rate, remained slow in August.  In recent 

months, money growth was damped by the moderate expansion in nominal income 

and the lagged effects of earlier increases in opportunity cost.  Liquid deposits, whose

rates of return tend to lag rising market rates, continued to run off.  In contrast, small 

time deposits and retail money funds, whose rates of return tend to adjust more 

promptly, increased briskly.  The currency component continued to expand at a 

sluggish rate, apparently due to weak overseas demand for U.S. currency. 

The Term Structure of Interest Rates and Growth Prospects  
 
Various econometric models of future real GDP growth that include the shape of the 
term structure suggest that the expansion will slow somewhat and that the odds of an 
outright recession have increased, on net, over the course of this year.  For example, a 
model that includes the slope of the yield curve—as measured by the difference 
between three-month and ten-year Treasury yields—and an estimate of the term 
premium, estimated with data over almost the past twenty years, now implies four-
quarter-ahead expansion of just below 3 percent.  This calculation is little changed 
since the August FOMC meeting and is broadly comparable to private sector 
forecasts, such as the Blue Chip consensus.  Also, a model using the slope of the yield 
curve and the short rate suggests that the probability that the economy will be in 
recession within the next four quarters is about 40 percent.  In contrast, respondents 
to the Blue Chip survey this month reported a 25 percent probability of recession.  
Notably, however, the point estimates derived from these models are highly sensitive 
to specification and sample selection, and therefore sizable confidence intervals 
surround implied growth rates as well as recession odds. 
 
 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 9 of 36



 

Economic Outlook 

(8) The staff forecast for real GDP growth has been lowered somewhat, owing 

to the effects of a more abrupt slowing in housing activity and lower growth in 

potential output.  The stimulus imparted by the recent appreciable decline in energy 

prices and by rallies in some financial markets provides only a partial offset to these 

effects.  Real GDP is anticipated to expand at about a 1¾ percent annual rate on 

balance over the remainder of 2006 before accelerating gradually over 2007 and 2008.  

Resource slack follows the same path as in the August Greenbook, with the 

unemployment rate edging up to 5¼ percent by the second half of 2008.  The staff 

forecast assumes that the Committee holds the stance of policy steady through mid-

2008 before easing policy slightly.  With that policy backdrop, long-term Treasury 

yields rise marginally from a level that is about 20 basis points lower than anticipated 

in the August Greenbook, and stock prices increase at about a 6½ percent annual rate 

from a starting point that is 2 percent higher than in the last forecast.  The foreign 

exchange value of the dollar depreciates gradually as in previous forecasts, but along a 

track that is 1 percent above that in August.  As suggested by futures quotes, oil prices 

are forecast to rebound somewhat from their recent declines but to run considerably 

below the path in the previous forecast.  The flattening out of energy prices and other 

commodity prices helps to nudge core PCE inflation down from about 2½ percent at 

an annual rate in the second half of 2006 to about 2 percent by the end of the forecast 

period.  Product and labor market slack also exert a small downward influence on the 

inflation outlook by 2008.  Overall PCE inflation runs at 2½ percent in 2007 and 

2 percent in 2008. 

Policy Alternatives 

(9) This Bluebook presents three formal policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A

Economic growth has moderated 
from its quite strong pace earlier

Rationale 

3.  Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated in recent months, and 
the high levels of resource 
utilization and of the prices of 
energy and other commodities have 
the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures.  However, inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, reflecting contained 
inflation expectations and the 
cumulative effects of monetary 
policy actions and other factors 
restraining aggregate demand. 

Although core inflation remains elevated, 
recent readings have been slightly more 
favorable.  While some inflation 
pressures persist, they seem likely to 
moderate over time, reflecting reduced 
impetus from energy prices, contained 
inflation expectations, and the 
cumulative effects of monetary policy 
actions and other factors restraining 
aggregate demand. 

Readings on core inflation have been 
elevated on balance, and the high levels 
of resource utilization and of the prices 
of energy and other commodities have 
the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures.  However, inflation pressures 
seem likely to moderate over time, 
reflecting reduced impetus from energy 
prices, contained inflation expectations, 
and the cumulative effects of monetary 
policy actions and other factors 
restraining aggregate demand. 

Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated on balance, and the 
high levels of resource utilization 
and of the prices of energy and 
other commodities have the 
potential to sustain inflation 
pressures.  In these circumstances, 
the Committee believed that an 
additional firming of policy was 
appropriate to foster a decline in 
inflation. 

Assessment of 
Risk 

4.  Nonetheless, the Committee 
judges that some inflation risks 
remain.  The extent and timing of 
any additional firming that may be 
needed to address these risks will 
depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

In recent weeks, the upside risks to 
inflation appear to have diminished 
somewhat and downside risks to growth 
have become more significant.  In these 
circumstances, future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and economic 
growth, as implied by incoming 
information.

and B, the Committee would again leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at 

this meeting; Alternative A would suggest that the Committee now sees the risks to 

growth and inflation as balanced, while Alternative B would repeat the indication 

from August that the Committee is concerned predominantly with inflation risks.  

Under Alternative C, the Committee would firm policy 25 basis points and, as in 

Alternative B, would highlight upside inflation risks.  A few key data releases are 

scheduled between the publication of this document and the Committee’s meeting, 

including consumer prices for August on Friday and housing starts on Tuesday, so the 

wording of the rationale portions of the various draft statements should be viewed as 

more tentative than usual. 

(10)  The Committee might want to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at 

5¼ percent if it finds the staff forecast to be both plausible and acceptable.  While the 

relatively slow pace of growth and the gradual decline in core inflation from an 

elevated level in that projection might have little appeal individually, policymakers may 

feel that circumstances are such that this combination of outcomes is likely the best 

that can be attained, particularly in light of the downward revision to longer-term 

growth prospects.  Holding the funds rate steady at this meeting would be generally 

consistent with the Committee’s past behavior as captured in the estimated policy 

rules shown in Chart 5, as well as with most of the simple policy rules shown in 

Chart 6.  Even if members harbored some reservations about the Greenbook outlook, 

policy inaction might be favored as balancing the risks of, on the one hand, a more 

precipitous downturn in housing and, on the other, some uptick in inflation pressures.  

(11) If the Committee deemed it appropriate to keep the funds rate unchanged 

at this meeting, its key remaining policy decision would seem to be its assessment of 

the risks to the economic outlook and the associated implications for future action.  

Alternative B in Table 1 is designed to signal that policy remains more likely to 

tighten than ease by repeating the sentiment of the August statement.  Such a position

For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staff’s estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
( *t ty y− ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap ( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and the assumed value 
of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective ( *π ).     
Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Except for backward-looking rules, it should be noted that prescriptions near the end of the Greenbook 
horizon also depend on extended baselines. 
 
  
 
Estimated Rules:  Estimation is performed using real-time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4, and the 
specifications are chosen according to the Bayesian information criterion.  Each rule incorporates a 75 
basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point increments that occurred 
during the first three quarters of 1998. Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are 
based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model.  The following table indicates the specification of 
each rule used for dynamic simulations and its root mean squared error over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

might be viewed as appropriate by the Committee if it saw high energy and other 

commodity prices and high levels of resource utilization as implying that the upside 

risks to inflation remain substantial.  Moreover, recent data on labor compensation 

and productivity, while not fully congruent with other indicators of labor costs, may 

also be seen as pointing to potentially substantial inflation risks, as in the “greater 

wage pressure” scenario presented in the Greenbook.   

(12) The rationale wording for Alternative B could note that the moderation in 

economic growth appears to be continuing.  In view of recent information on the 

residential construction sector, it could indicate that the housing market is cooling, 

rather than referring to a “gradual” cooling as in the August statement.  The 

paragraph on inflation could be generally similar to the one in the previous statement.  

However, to acknowledge that the most recent data on core inflation were lower than 

those in preceding months—but not to be seen as overly optimistic in that regard—

the statement could indicate that core inflation readings have been elevated “on 

balance” over recent months.  The Committee might also wish to explain more 

explicitly its expectation that inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time by 

citing a reduced impetus from energy prices.  

(13) Money market options indicate that investors are quite sure that the 

Committee will keep the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent at this meeting.  In addition, 

the Desk’s survey of primary dealers indicates an anticipation that the statement 

released after this meeting will about replicate the August announcement, apart from 

some updating of the characterization of the economy and inflation.  Accordingly, the 

market reaction to this alternative should be quite limited. 

(14) Judging from current financial quotes, market participants do not view 

maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent for some time as an approach the 

FOMC would select to balance competing macroeconomic risks.  Even though the 

Committee identified upside risks as its predominant concern in the August 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 36



 

statement, money market futures prices suggest the anticipation of ½ percentage 

point of policy easing next year, an expectation that imparts financial stimulus to the 

extent that it has been incorporated in other asset values.  If that stimulus is seen as 

excessive, the Committee could use the statement as a means to make plainer its 

assessment that the policy rate is more likely to rise than to fall.  In particular, the 

Committee could strike the reassuring phrase “on balance” about recent inflation 

readings in row 2 of Alternative B and add an explicit characterization of the odds of 

future action in row 4.  For example, after explaining that inflation risks remain, the 

Committee could add that “. . . policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward.” 

(15) In contrast, with overall economic activity apparently decelerating further in 

the current quarter, inflation data for July more favorable than in preceding months, 

and energy and other commodity prices down notably in recent weeks, the Committee 

may now view the upside risks to inflation as having diminished somewhat and as 

roughly balanced by the downside risks to economic activity.  If so, the Committee 

may be attracted to Alternative A, under which the stance of policy would be 

maintained at this meeting and the statement would no longer suggest a predilection 

to firm policy going forward.  While moderate economic growth may be viewed as the 

modal outcome under an unchanged federal funds rate, the downside risks to growth 

may seem considerable in light of the most recent data pointing to a more 

pronounced slowing in housing activity, a possibility that is illustrated by the “housing 

slump” scenario in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the Committee may see the recent 

decline in the prices of oil and other commodities as potentially signaling a slowdown 

in global economic growth.  In any case, with the real federal funds rate at the upper 

end of the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium (Chart 7), policy may 

now be in a stance that is consistent with below-potential economic growth going 

forward, so that resource pressures are likely to diminish some.  And, if the 

Committee believes that energy prices probably will not return to their higher levels of

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.   

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

earlier this year, it may view inflation pressures as likely to ebb slowly, such as in the 

Greenbook forecast.  If so, the Committee may not see particularly high odds that 

policy will need to be tightened further.     

(16) The rationale for Alternative A could be similar to that for Alternative B, 

except that the Committee may wish to note explicitly that recent inflation readings 

have been slightly more favorable than those of previous months.  In the risk 

assessment, the Committee would mention downside risks to growth and indicate that 

future policy adjustments, implicitly in either direction, will depend on the 

implications of incoming data for the outlook. 

(17) While market participants expect no policy action at this meeting, they do 

not appear to anticipate a policy statement that identifies downside risks to growth 

and that no longer hints at a possible need for additional firming.  Market participants 

could read such a statement simply as a step in the transition to the policy easing that 

is already foreseen; in this case, there would probably be only moderate effects on 

other market prices.  But market participants might instead extrapolate from this 

statement, inferring that the Committee was more likely to ease rates before long.  In 

this latter case, the downward tilt to the market’s expected path for policy could 

steepen somewhat, and shorter-term Treasury yields could decline a little.  The value 

of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would likely edge lower, and stock prices 

would rally.  The implications for long-term yields could depend in part on what 

investors read into the announcement about the Committee’s longer-term inflation 

intentions.   

(18) If the FOMC expected stronger growth or higher inflation than the staff, or 

if it saw the Greenbook forecast as credible but was unhappy with the forecast path 

for inflation, it might wish to take another firming step at this meeting, as in 

Alternative C.   The Committee’s concerns about the inflation outlook may have 

been exacerbated by recent compensation and productivity data.  Moreover, in the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 36



 

staff projection, core PCE inflation is projected to remain a bit above 2 percent until 

late 2008—an outcome that would mark five consecutive years of elevated core 

inflation relative to the objectives cited by a number of members of the Committee.  

Overall inflation likewise is forecast to remain relatively high until 2008.  Given this 

forecast, members may believe that acceptable progress toward price stability will 

likely involve a somewhat firmer stance of monetary policy over coming quarters than 

assumed by the staff.  Even if the Committee found the rate of decline in inflation 

forecast in the Greenbook to be generally acceptable, it might wish to firm policy 

another step at this meeting to provide more assurance that inflation was headed 

down. 

(19) An announcement associated with Alternative C could, as in the August 

statement, indicate that growth “has moderated” and, as in the other alternatives, drop 

the word “gradual” in characterizing the cooling of the housing market.  The first 

sentence in the inflation paragraph could also be similar to the one in the August 

statement, but it might include the phrase “on balance” to acknowledge implicitly the 

lower inflation figures published for July.  Rather than repeat the expectation that 

inflation pressures would moderate, the Committee could state that it took the firming 

action to foster a decline in inflation.  The Committee might also want to indicate 

that, despite the firming step, it continued to be concerned with inflation risks, as it 

was in August, and again reference the possibility of additional firming.  If, by 

contrast, the Committee saw such a step as a final “insurance” move against inflation, 

the risk assessment section could take a neutral position and simply indicate that 

future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook, 

thereby suggesting that the Committee no longer had a predisposition to firm policy. 

(20) The tightening of policy and the statement shown under Alternative C of 

Table 1 would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  Investors 

would likely conclude that at least one more policy firming action was in store after 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 36



 

the action at this meeting.  Nominal money market rates and shorter-term coupon 

yields would rise sharply.  Real rates further out the curve could also increase, but 

nominal long-term yields could decline if market participants concluded that the 

FOMC was seeking a steeper decline and had a lower ultimate objective for inflation 

than they had previously perceived.  With real rates higher, the foreign exchange value 

of the dollar would likely rise, and equity prices would probably decline.  However, if 

the Committee instead opted to remove the reference to future firming and to suggest 

that it saw the risks as balanced after the move, these market responses would likely 

be muted considerably. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(21) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to average about 

2½ percent at an annual rate over the remainder of 2006, restrained by damped 

expansion of nominal income and the lagged effects of past policy tightening on 

opportunity costs.  The velocity of M2 is forecast to rise 1½ percent over 2006, after 

increasing at an average annual rate of 1¾ percent in the previous two years.  Over 

2007 and 2008, however, M2 accelerates gradually to about a 5 percent annual growth 

rate, about in line with nominal income, as opportunity costs level out and then 

decline slightly in response to the cessation of policy tightening. 

(22) Household debt is expected to slow noticeably over the next several 

quarters.  The rate of expansion of home mortgage debt declines considerably, 

reflecting lower residential investment and sharply decelerating home prices.  The 

growth rate of business debt is also projected to decline a little, mainly as a result of 

much slower commercial mortgage borrowing compared with its torrid pace of recent 

years.  Federal sector debt is forecast to expand at a bit more than a 6 percent annual 

rate on average over the forecast period.  All told, the growth of domestic

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(23) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate further seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO 

an average of around ________ 5¼ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. In recent weeks, the upside risks to inflation appear to have diminished 

somewhat and downside risks to growth have become more significant.  

In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on the 

evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as 

implied by incoming information. 

B. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  

The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to 

address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. 

C. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  

The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to 

address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

                * For real rates, measures using the Philadelphia Fed Survey employ the ten−year inflation expectations from the
                Blue Chip Survey until April 1991 and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters
                thereafter (median value of respondents).  Measures using the Michigan Survey employ the five− to ten−year

Appendix Chart 8

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
