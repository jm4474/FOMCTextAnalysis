The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



Strictly Confidential (F.R.) August 18, 2000
Class II -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The FOMC's decision at its June meeting to leave the target federal funds rate

unchanged and to retain a statement judging the balance of risks as weighted toward inflation

came as little surprise to market participants.1 However, investors interpreted the

announcement of the FOMC's decision and the Chairman's monetary policy testimony as

emphasizing signs of a moderation in the growth of economic activity. Against that

backdrop, economic data releases over the intermeeting period were viewed on net as

confirming that demand growth was slowing to a sustainable pace and price pressures would

remain damped, and investors marked down their expected level of the funds rate next year

by about 25 basis points (chart 1). Futures markets have priced in virtually no chance of a

tightening at the August meeting and little change in the federal funds rate over the next

year.

(2) The downward revision over the intermeeting period in investors' expectations

for the path of the target funds rate contributed to a modest easing in domestic financial

1 The federal funds rate averaged close to 6-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. On
July 5, the Desk announced new guidelines for its management of the System portfolio. The
new procedures cap SOMA participation at each Treasury auction at a maximum percentage
of the total amount issued, with the percentages declining as the maturity of securities being
auctioned increases. The same schedule of percentage caps was established to guide SOMA
secondary market purchases of securities. As a result of the auction caps, the Desk
redeemed $10.4 billion of bills and $367 million of coupons over the intermeeting period.
The Desk's outright purchases included $1.9 billion of bills, of which $93 million were
bought directly from foreign accounts, and $9.8 billion of coupons, with the coupon
purchases tilted toward shorter maturities, consistent with the new guidelines.

conditions, on net. Nominal Treasury coupon yields dropped 20 to 30 basis points, while

the ten-year Treasury inflation-indexed yield shed about 5 basis points. The narrowing

spread of nominal over real Treasury yields suggests some decline in inflation compensation,

though survey measures of long-term inflation expectations were little changed. Corporate

bond yields also fell, but generally not by as much as Treasuries. The resulting slight

widening in spreads did not seem to reflect an increased reluctance to bear risk. Investors

purchased sizable offerings of new private bonds, including longer-term issues and lower-tier

credits, as well as both seasoned and initial public offerings of equities. Still, looking over a

somewhat longer period, investors do seem to have become more cautious: Risk spreads for

lower-rated firms are at fairly high levels historically and are a good bit wider now than they

were earlier this year; similarly, banks have reported tightening their terms and standards on

business loans throughout the year. With interest rates down over the most recent

intermeeting period, broad stock price indexes rose 1-1/2 to 3 percent.

(3) The dollar firmed on balance in foreign exchange markets, even though

interest-rate differentials moved against assets denominated in dollars relative to those

denominated in the currencies of other industrial countries. Within the major currency

index, the dollar appreciated about 2-3/4 percent against the yen and 4 percent against the

euro. The Bank of Japan raised its policy rate 25 basis points on August 11 in the face of

objections from the rest of the government, ending the zero-interest-rate policy that had

prevailed for about eighteen months. This move mostly brought forward tightening that had



-3-

already been embedded in market prices, and intermediate- and longer-term Japanese yields

changed little, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Japanese equity prices rallied after

the policy tightening, but still declined about 6 percent over the past eight weeks, perhaps

reacting to a rising level of bankruptcies, including that of a prominent retailer. The

European Central Bank has kept policy on hold in recent months, but officials have been

hinting broadly that more tightening is in store given the vigor in spending along with the

uptick in inflation and weakness in the euro. Still, longer-term yields are down 5 to 10 basis

points across Europe, and equity prices have posted mixed changes. There was no

intervention by U.S. monetary authorities over the intermeeting period.

.The exchange value of the dollar depreciated

a little on net against the currencies of other important trading partners, paced by a

substantial rise in the exchange value of the Mexican peso. Prospects brightened in Mexico

on the promise of a peaceful transition of power following the opposition party's victory in

the presidential election along with strength in economic data and higher oil prices.

Emerging market bond spreads narrowed further, with the Mexican spread shedding 75 basis

points.

(4) The moderation in the growth of private spending in the second quarter and

the tightening in financial conditions through May did not seem to affect the pace of

borrowing materially this spring. Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt in the second

quarter is estimated at a 5-1/4 percent rate, only a touch below that in the first quarter. The

slight slowdown was entirely accounted for by a faster paydown of federal debt; private

borrowing remained quite brisk. In the household sector, growth of mortgage debt and

consumer credit was robust. Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations was boosted by

continued strong investment spending and an upturn in cash-financed mergers and

acquisitions. Partial data for July and early August from banks and securities markets suggest

the pace of household and business borrowing may have moderated somewhat more

recently, in part reflecting a reduced amount of equity retirements.

(5) The growth of M2 has slowed on average in recent months. M2 expanded at a

3-1/4 percent rate in June and July; partial data for August suggest some pickup in growth

this month, but only to about a 5 percent pace. The stepdown in monetary expansion most

likely reflects the widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2 stemming from recent

policy tightenings and perhaps also the slowdown in consumption growth. On average over

the past three months, M2 has been running about in line with the pace that would be

expected from our standard monthly M2 demand model, given actual interest rates and

Greenbook estimates and projections of income. M3 accelerated in July, advancing at a 9

percent clip, and partial data suggest growth at about that rate in August. In large part, the

spurt in M3 growth has been propelled by inflows to institutional money funds.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(6) The staffs forecasts of the growth rates of structural labor productivity and

potential GDP through 2001 have been raised noticeably. As a consequence, though the

projected expansion of actual GDP also has been boosted, the unemployment rate edges up

to a slightly higher level than in the last forecast. The higher unemployment rate and the

damping effects of faster productivity growth on unit labor costs trim the pickup in core

inflation relative to the previous forecast. Still, as in the last Greenbook, conditions are such

that inflation is poised to continue to rise beyond the forecast horizon, and the staff has

retained its assumption that the federal funds rate will be increased 3/4 percentage point by

the end of 2001. However, the staff now assumes that these policy actions will be deferred

until next year, when inflation prospects become more evident. As policy begins to firm and

market participants come to realize that the build-up of inflationary pressures will require

considerable additional tightening, private bond and mortgage rates are anticipated to rise by

an amount roughly comparable to the assumed rise in the funds rate, and equity prices are

expected to stay around current levels. In contrast to the June Greenbook, the staff

projection for real GDP growth for 2001 is somewhat above the central tendency of

Committee members' projections reported to the Congress last month. Nonetheless, with

the staff now also forecasting faster growth of potential output, its projections of the

unemployment rate and total PCE inflation for next year remain consistent with the

Committee members' central tendencies.



(7) Recent data on spending, productivity, and labor costs could well be seen by

the Committee as on balance supporting a decision to leave the federal funds rate target

unchanged at 6-1/2 percent, as in alternative B. Signs of an appreciable moderation in

aggregate demand growth no longer seem to be just "tentative and preliminary," and unit

labor costs point toward little near-term pressure on inflation. Indeed, the growth of

aggregate demand may have already slowed enough to keep the unemployment rate from

falling, even before the effects on the economy of previous policy firmings and the flattening

in equity prices have fully played out. The conviction that aggregate demand is now growing

in line with the expansion of potential output would be strengthened if the Committee found

plausible the staff's upward revision to the rate of increase in productivity. However, even if

the current level of resource utilization holds for a time, whether that level will ultimately

prove sustainable remains an open question. In the meantime, with costs contained and

long-term inflation expectations stable or even drifting a bit lower, the Committee might

expect to incur little economic cost by awaiting more information to help answer that

question.

(8) Although the odds that pressures on resources will not intensify may seem

better balanced now than they did eight weeks ago, the Committee may still see the risks as

tilted toward an unacceptable inflation outcome, given the persisting strength in elements of

aggregate demand, the low unemployment rate, and the somewhat elevated current rate of

core inflation. The choice of alternative B, accompanied by a sentence conveying a balance



-8-

of risks weighted in an inflationary direction, would accord with the expectations of market

participants. No significant immediate response would be forthcoming in financial markets.

Under the staff forecast, economic data over the intermeeting period are likely to continue to

indicate moderate demand growth and contained inflation and thus should have little net

effect on market prices.

(9) The 25 basis point increase in the targeted funds rate of alternative C would

seem appropriate if the inflation forecasted by the staff were seen as likely and unacceptable.

It might be viewed as unacceptable in part because the already prevailing core CPI inflation

rate of 2-1/2 percent in the Greenbook may be judged to be inconsistent with the Federal

Reserve's longer-run objective of effective price stability. Even if the Committee were

willing to tolerate such a rate of price increase for a while, inflation is headed higher in the

staff forecast in that the economy already has overshot the levels of output and employment

that are sustainable in the longer run. In such circumstances, delaying needed policy firming

could allow inflationary pressures to build, eventually requiring a more disruptive policy

tightening and economic slowdown to achieve the same long-run inflation outcome. Aside

from the current level of resource utilization, the Committee may see significant upside risks

to inflation. Oil prices have remained stubbornly high, and the decline projected by the staff

may not materialize, eliminating a source of prospective price restraint and perhaps inducing

a ratcheting-up of inflation expectations. In addition, the restraint on aggregate demand put

in place by the Committee's prior tightenings has been offset to some extent by the recent



-9-

rally in capital markets, and prospective increases in productivity growth may boost wealth

and expected earnings even more than they have already, especially if real interest rates lie

below the higher marginal product of capital.

(10) The choice of alternative C would surprise market participants, raising

questions about the path for monetary policy going forward. Market participants might

wonder whether the Committee has read incoming data as more worrisome than they

themselves have or whether the Committee was intent on attaining a lower inflation

objective than investors previously perceived. The resulting upward adjustment to

participants' impression of the degree of future monetary policy restraint that is likely to be

implemented would be especially pronounced if the Committee retained a balance-of-risks

sentence emphasizing inflationary concerns. Bond rates, particularly in real terms, could be

expected to rise along with short-term yields, the dollar would probably appreciate further,

and stock prices would adjust downward. Conversely, a switch to a sentence conveying a

balanced set of risks would foster a much greater sense of certainty in markets that the peak

in short-term rates had been reached. In this case, the immediate price response in financial

markets would be tempered, apart from an upward adjustment of short-term rates of around

1/4 percentage point.

(11) With no change in the funds rate over the rest of the year in the staff forecast,

the growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to slow to a 4-1/2

percent annual rate over the June-to-December period after its 5-1/2 percent pace over the



-10-

first six months of the year. The deceleration owes to a slowdown of nonfederal debt

growth to a 7-1/2 percent rate from 9 percent from December to June. Both a moderation

in the growth of nominal spending on consumer durables and fixed investment in the second

half of the year and a slowing in equity retirements lead to some abatement of private-sector

borrowing. The paydown of federal debt is foreseen as continuing at a similar pace over the

last six months of the year, as the federal budget remains in surplus. In the staff forecast, M2

is expected to grow at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate over the five-month period from July to

December, a step-up from the pace of the last three months as the effects of previous

increases in market interest rates wane.

Directive and Balance of Risks Language

(12) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1) the

directive and (2) the "balance of risks" sentence to be included in the press release issued

after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-

run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the federal funds rate at/TO

an average of around ____ [DEL: 6-1/2] percent.

(2) "Balance of Risks" Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable

economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the

risks are [balanced with respect to prospects for both goals] [weighted mainly toward

conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures] [weighted mainly toward

conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the foreseeable future.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 13 are week-ending averages. Columns 2 through 4 are on a coupon equivalent basis. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper
trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Column 14 is the Bond Buyer revenue index, which is a 1-day quote for Thursday.
Column 15 is the average contract rate on new commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new
commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
