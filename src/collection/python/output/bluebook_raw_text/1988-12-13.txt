MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Immediately following the November 1 FOMC meeting, reserve

paths continued to incorporate adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $600

million. As the month progressed, however, it became increasingly evident

that the shortfall in demands on the discount window that had first sur-

faced in mid-October was widening. In these circumstances, the Desk

allowed a lower level of borrowing than the target while federal funds

were trading at a slightly higher rate than had been anticipated at the

time of the meeting. Specifically, in the first full maintenance period

of November, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged $396 million,

while the average funds rate remained just above 8-1/4 percent. To take

formal account of the apparent change in borrowing behavior, but also in

light of incoming information suggesting considerable strength in the

economic expansion with the potential for price pressures, the Manager for

Domestic Operations on November 22 reduced the borrowing assumption to

$400 million, with the expectation that federal funds would trade in a

range around 8-3/8 percent. In the most recent complete maintenance

period, the funds rate averaged at this level; borrowing increased to $699

million, but almost half of this amount was due to a computer problem at a

large commercial bank. Similarly, a funds transfer failure at a Reserve

1. This total included $145 million resulting from a computer problem
at a commercial bank.



Bank led to a spike in borrowing in the current maintenance period, ac-

counting for $265 million of the average adjustment plus seasonal borrow-

ing of $516 million for the first eight days of the period.

(2) Over the last week, federal funds have firmed a bit further

to trade around 8-1/2 percent, nearly 1/4 percentage point above the level

at the time of the last meeting. Other short-term rates have registered

substantially larger increases on balance, as expectations of Federal

Reserve tightening have been encouraged by release of strong economic

data, higher world oil prices, and weakness in the dollar over much of the

period. The prime rate was raised 50 basis points and most short-term

market interest rates have risen roughly 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point since

the beginning of November, with anticipation of some year-end pressures

apparent in the still-larger increases at the one-month maturity. Long-

term rates rose along with short-term rates, though by appreciably less,

as market participants apparently did not view economic developments as

presaging a sustained intensification of inflation, perhaps in part be-

cause of the anticipated response of the Federal Reserve. More recently,

some of the initial increases in bond rates have been trimmed amid hopes

for significant federal deficit reductions--sparked mainly by reports that

the Soviet Union would announce sharp defense cuts. On balance, the 30-

year rate is only about 20 basis points above its early-November level.

These movements have left yields on Treasury securities with maturities of

one year or longer all about 9 percent, while the yield curve on shorter

maturities has retained a moderate upward slope. Stock prices fell during



the first half of the intermeeting period, but most indexes have since

recovered to nearly their values at the time of the November meeting.

(3) Immediately after the U.S. elections on November 8, the

dollar resumed its steep decline in foreign exchange markets. By early

December, the dollar had dropped by about 3-1/4 percent on a weighted-

average basis since the last Committee meeting, bringing the total depre-

ciation from its late-September peak to nearly 9-1/2 percent. Exchange

market participants appeared to be concerned that the international

adjustment process was slowing and that U.S. macroeconomic policies were

not doing enough to restrain U.S. domestic demand. In recent days, as

prospects for budget deficit reduction seemed somewhat brighter, the dol-

lar has recovered a little. Over the intermeeting period, rising interest

differentials have helped to support the dollar. Short-term market inter-

est rates increased only slightly in most major foreign countries (except

in the United Kingdom where they rose markedly) and long-term rates abroad

were about unchanged.

with the Desk accounting for

$1.9 billion, primarily against yen, but also against marks.

(4) The broader monetary aggregates accelerated last month from

the unusually sluggish pace of September and October, with surprising

strength in the liquid retail components of M2. This aggregate rose at a

6-1/2 percent annual rate in November, bringing its two-month growth rate

to nearly 4 percent, compared with the 2-1/2 percent September-to-December

pace specified by the FOMC at its last meeting. The pickup in M2 occurred

despite continued weakness in Ml, which remained about flat last month, as

it has been since midsummer. The runoff in demand deposits resumed in

November and currency demand moderated; as a result, growth of the mone-

tary base slowed somewhat. M3 growth rose to 6-1/4 percent last month,

implying a 5-1/2 percent rate of increase over the September-to-November

period--consistent with the Committee's 6 percent specification for the

final three months of this year given the expected further pickup in

December.

(5) Balances in OCDs, savings deposits, and money market mutual

funds rose substantially last month. This may have reflected the uncer-

tain outlook for interest rates, as well as some parking of funds received

from stock sales in corporate restructurings. For example, the surge in

savings deposits primarily reflected the deposit of proceeds of a par-

ticular change in corporate ownership. Small time deposit growth, while

softening somewhat, remained in double digits, leaving growth of total

retail-type balances in M2 at a rapid 8-1/4 percent rate last month. The

inflow of retail deposits was concentrated at commercial banks and, com-

bined with some slowing in bank credit growth, trimmed bank needs for

additional managed liabilities; as a result their net new issuance of

large CDs in M3 virtually ceased. At thrifts, growth of large CDs also

slowed substantially, despite weak growth of core deposits, as they

increased their reliance on advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks.

(6) Bank credit growth ebbed in November to a 5-3/4 percent

annual rate as security acquisitions slowed and C&I loans edged lower.

Overall business borrowing appears to have been relatively weak last



month, despite some financing of corporate restructuring. In the long-

term market, investment-grade industrial offerings remained sparse, al-

though the market came up with a few new forms of insurance against "event

risk" (present whenever a corporation is perceived as vulnerable to a

takeover or significant financial restructuring). Junk bond issuance,

however, remained robust in November, fueled by merger-related demands.

In other sectors, municipal bond offerings dropped off last month, and it

appears that consumer borrowing may have too. Available data suggest,

however, that mortgage demand has been well maintained.

(7) For 1988, the staff expects debt growth to remain just below

the center of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range, at 8-3/4 percent on a

fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis. The targeted monetary aggregates,

M2 and M3, also are likely to come in near the 6 percent midpoints of

their ranges, increasing 5-1/4 and 6-1/2 percent, respectively. These

growth rates represent a pickup of roughly 1 percentage point from 1987,

despite the stronger restraining influence of rising interest rates this

year. In 1988 growth of M2 has been more closely in line with its his-

torical relation to income and interest rates than in 1987, when this

aggregate expanded unusually slowly. At the beginning of this year, the

opportunity costs of holding monetary assets were quite narrow, reflecting

the declines in market interest rates after last October's stock market

crash. As a result, money demand was rather buoyant early in the year.

After midyear, however, M2 decelerated markedly, largely in response to

the turnaround in market interest rates and opportunity costs that ensued

from the series of tightening moves initiated by the Federal Reserve in



-7-

March. M1 growth also followed this uneven pattern over the year, but,

reflecting its larger interest rate sensitivity, fell to just 4 percent on

a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, its lowest rate of growth in

nearly 20 years. The pickup in M3 growth for the year occurred despite

some slowing in credit growth at depository institutions, but these

institutions relied relatively less on Eurodollar borrowing and other non-

M3 sources of funds in 1988 than they had in 1987.



Policy Alternatives

(8) Two policy alternatives are presented below for Committee

consideration. The relation between federal funds rates and borrowing

under both alternatives is unusually uncertain, in light of the recent

shortfalls in borrowing relative to the spread of the funds rate over the

discount rate. The possibility of year-end pressures in the funds market

and the scope for changing expectations of near-term policy actions add

to this uncertainty over coming weeks. Under Alternative B, a borrowing

objective of $400 million would be retained, and federal funds would be

expected to settle mainly into an 8-3/8 to 8-1/2 percent range, though

slightly higher rates are possible through year-end. Alternative C incor-

porates an increase in intended discount borrowing to $600 million, with

the federal funds rate likely to move up to around 8-7/8 to 9 percent.

Similar conditions in the funds market also could be engendered through a

1/2 point rise in the discount rate to 7 percent, while keeping borrowing

at $400 million. These relations assume that most, though perhaps not

all, of the recent shortfall in borrowing will persist; smaller banks may

well remain less willing to tap the discount window, but large bank

borrowing, while subject to the usual vicissitudes of computer problems,

could return toward normal once the year-end, with its anticipated money

market pressures, is past.

(9) The money growth paths from November to March associated

with each alternative are presented in the table below. Under both

alternatives, M2 growth over coming months would be relatively restrained,



reflecting recent and, under alternative C, prospective increases in mar-

ket interest rates. As a consequence, this aggregate in March would be in

the lower portion of its tentative 3 to 7 percent range for 1989. M3

through March would be above the midpoint of its tentative 3-1/2 to 7-1/2

percent range under either alternative, boosted by the expected surge in

managed liabilities at banks to fund lending associated with mergers and

buyouts.

(10) Short-term market interest rates are likely to retreat some-

what under alternative B. These rates now embody some near-term firming of

policy, and as funds ease back a bit from their recent trading range and as

no subsequent tightening move materializes, short-term rates are likely to

drop. The 3-month Treasury bill rate should fall from around the recent

8 percent level to 7-3/4 percent or even below. The extent of any decline

could be damped for a time, however, reflecting the effects of normal year-

end activity and a potential surge in credit demands associated with

corporate restructuring over coming months. These developments will have

their greatest impact on short-term rates, especially in light of the large

volume of bank financing of equity retirements. Any declines in long-term

-11-

rates might be quite limited, given the recent rally in bond markets. These

markets already seem to be building in some prospective budget deficit

reduction, and would be sensitive to any indication of disappointing

progress. Moreover, the dollar likely would come under downward pressure

under this alternative, raising concern about future inflation trends,

especially if the decline occurred in the context of continued strength in

the economy as envisioned in the staff forecast.

(11) From a November base, M2 growth is expected to average 4 per-

cent at an annual rate through March under alternative B, maintaining its

average pace of October and November. Liquid balances may be boosted a

little over the near term by the spate of corporate buyouts. This effect

should be minimal for M1, since share sellers are unlikely to keep funds in

idle or low-yielding balances for long. For M2, any such effects are ex-

pected to dissipate over the first quarter as funds are redeployed. Even

though short-term rates might drop from recent levels under this alterna-

tive, they would remain above those of late summer and early fall. This net

advance in interest rates and deposit opportunity costs coming on top of the

earlier increases would damp M2 demand in the first quarter about as strong-

ly as it was restrained in the second half of this year. Based on the

greenbook forecast for GNP, M2 velocity is expected to rise at a 4 percent

annual rate in the first quarter, near its estimated pace in each of the

last two quarters of 1988.

(12) M3 growth of 7 percent at an annual rate is anticipated from

November to March under alternative B, somewhat above the average of the

last two months. This aggregate should accelerate around year-end, spurred



-12-

by massive LBO and merger financing requirements, which will require a sub-

stantial pickup in managed liabilities, including large CDs. However, M3

growth is expected to moderate to around 6-1/2 percent in February and

March, as bank credit growth returns to its former trend. Quarterly aver-

age M3 growth would be associated with a gain of M3 velocity in the first

quarter of about 1-1/2 percent, close to the pace of the previous two

quarters.

(13) Credit-financed corporate restructuring is expected to boost

the growth rate of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors to a 10 percent

annual rate from November to March, leaving this aggregate in the upper half

of its tentative 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent range for 1989. Net equity

retirements over these four months are projected at a record pace, with

business borrowing at banks and in the commercial paper market bearing the

brunt of the outsized credit demands. Abstracting from the effects of the

pickup in equity retirements, business borrowing would be expected to con-

tinue at about the pace of earlier this year. In the household sector,

mortgage borrowing is likely to continue near the pace of the last few

quarters as home sales are anticipated to hold close to recent levels for

several months, especially to the extent that interest rates stabilize or

ease off under alternative B. Consumer credit growth may pick up tempo-

rarily early next year if, as expected, auto makers step up their sales

promotions to boost demand. The federal government is expected to increase

further its issuance of coupon securities, now that the Treasury has long-

bond authority, but as seasonal financing needs ease with a pickup of tax

receipts, the Treasury is expected to lessen net bill issuance. State and



-13-

local government offerings are likely to stay relatively subdued, though any

tendency for rates to drop under this alternative might foster a renewed

interest in refunding outstanding debt.

(14) Although market rates incorporate some near-term firming of

policy, an immediate rise in federal funds to the 8-7/8 to 9 percent area

associated with alternative C likely would elicit some further increase in

short-term market interest rates. Such increases, however, are likely to be

less than the nearly half point upward movement of the federal funds rate.

In addition, the prime rate would be boosted further. Long-term rates would

be likely to rise by somewhat less, especially if Federal Reserve actions

were seen as further reducing the potential for higher inflation. A dis-

count rate increase would be viewed as a more forceful step, prompting a

more immediate increase in short-term rates and one that might be larger as

well if markets interpreted it as portending even further policy tightening.

Downward pressure on the dollar would be offset, and the currency could even

firm for a time, especially if the tightening took the form of a discount

rate increase. Any upward pressure on the dollar would likely be mitigated

by firmer policy abroad, as foreign monetary authorities took advantage of

this opportunity to respond to the potential for inflation pressures in

their own economies.

(15) M2 growth probably would be held down to a 3 percent annual

rate from November to March under alternative C, placing this aggregate just

at the lower end of its tentative 1989 target range. The higher funds rate

of this alternative would reinforce the restraining influence on M2 demand

of rate increases earlier this year. Given the still flatter market yield



-14-

curve, however, household demands for those liquid assets whose rates do

adjust promptly--such as money funds--could be relatively strong. With

higher market interest rates, M1 likely would remain about unchanged on

balance through March. Some restraint also would show through to M3, which

would be expected to post a 6-1/2 percent annual growth rate over the next

four months. Higher market interest rates would curb inflows to institu-

tion-only money funds, and should damp credit extensions by depository

institutions somewhat, even as a further shifting of business credit demands

from long-term markets toward banks also is induced. By March M3 still

would be well above the 5-1/2 percent midpoint of its 1989 target range.

Directive Language

(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

options for varying degrees of reserve pressure and for symmetry and

asymmetry, is presented below:

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. Taking account of indications of

inflationary pressures, the strength of the business

expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and

developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial

markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint

would (MIGHT), or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve

restraint (WOULD) might, be acceptable in the intermeet-

ing period. The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over

the period from NOVEMBER [DEL: September] through MARCH [DEL: December]

at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 2-1/2 and 6] percent,

respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee con-

sultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that reserve conditions during the period

before the next meeting are likely to be associated with

a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____

TO ____ [DEL: 6 to 10] percent.
