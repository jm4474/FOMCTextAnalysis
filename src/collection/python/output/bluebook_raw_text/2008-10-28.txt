Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR) October 23, 2008 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1)   Financial markets came under extraordinary stress over the intermeeting 

period.  Markets were roiled by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (which occurred 

just before the September FOMC meeting), the difficulties at AIG, the closing of 

Washington Mutual, and the forced sale of Wachovia.  Those events intensified 

already heightened concerns about the condition of other U.S. financial institutions 

and about the impact of financial developments on the broader economy.  Against 

this backdrop, investors pulled back further from risk taking; as a consequence, 

funding markets for terms beyond overnight essentially ceased to function for a time 

and still remain severely impaired, yields and spreads on money market instruments 

and corporate bonds shot up, secondary market prices for leveraged syndicated loans 

plunged, and equity prices registered steep declines amid extremely high volatility.  

Financial markets abroad experienced similar swings.   

(2) In response, the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Securities and Exchange 

Commission, and many foreign central banks and governments took an 

unprecedented series of policy initiatives over the intermeeting period.  Sentiment in 

credit markets seemed to improve somewhat late in the period, and there was a 

modest recovery in liquidity in bank funding markets after the U.S. and foreign 

governments announced they would inject capital into their banking systems and 

guarantee selected liabilities of banking organizations in their jurisdictions.  However, 

markets generally remain extremely illiquid and volatile, and investors are still quite 

skittish.   



   

(3) On net over the intermeeting period, market participants marked down 

substantially the expected path of monetary policy, with some of the decline occurring 

after the intermeeting cut in the target federal funds rate on October 8, and they now 

foresee an additional rate cut at the October 28-29 meeting.  Short-term nominal 

Treasury yields fell amid heavy flight-to-quality flows, while longer-term yields rose, 

reportedly in response to expectations of increased Treasury issuance to finance 

various government initiatives.  Issuance of corporate debt slowed further amid the 

unfavorable market conditions, and nonfinancial businesses drew heavily on existing 

lines of credit at banks.  The dollar appreciated against all major foreign currencies 

except the yen.   

Financial Institutions 

(4) Investor sentiment deteriorated early in the intermeeting period in reaction 

to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the rapid deterioration in the financial 

condition of AIG.1  These developments precipitated losses at other financial entities, 

including prime money market mutual funds (MMMFs).  Prominently, one of these— 

the Reserve Primary Fund—“broke the buck” on September 16, triggering rapid and 

widespread outflows from other prime MMMFs and inflows into those holding 

predominantly Treasury securities (Chart 1).  Prime funds responded to the surge in 

redemptions by reducing their purchases of commercial paper and other short-term 

assets, causing significant strains in these markets.  Meanwhile short-term Treasury 

bill yields plummeted amid sharp inflows into Treasury-only MMMFs.  Intense 

                                           
1 On September 16, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a liquidity facility 
that would provide up to $85 billion in credit to assist AIG in meeting its obligations as they 
come due.  This facility has a 24-month term, with interest accruing on the outstanding 
balance at a rate of three-month Libor plus 850 basis points, and is collateralized by all the 
assets of AIG and of its primary non-regulated subsidiaries.  On October 8, the Federal 
Reserve announced an additional program under which it will lend up to $37.8 billion to 
finance investment-grade, fixed-income securities held by AIG.  These securities had been 
previously lent by AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries to third parties.

demands among investors to hold Treasury securities and increased counterparty 

concerns reportedly led to a substantial scaling back of activity among traditional 

securities lenders in the Treasury market, contributing to strains in the Treasury repo 

and cash markets that were evidenced by a very high volume of fails-to-deliver.  

Redemptions from prime MMMFs slowed after the Treasury established a temporary 

guarantee program for balances held in MMMFs and the Federal Reserve announced 

its Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Lending Facility 

(AMLF) on September 19, although outflows continued until early October.2  Use of 

the AMLF to finance purchases of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) ramped 

up quickly to about $150 billion by early October but has diminished substantially of 

late.  Further, to support a private-sector initiative designed to provide liquidity to 

MMMFs, on October 21 the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Money 

Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF).3 

(5) Difficulties also intensified at a number of depository institutions.  The 

FDIC’s decision to resolve the failure of Washington Mutual (WaMu) on September 

25 in a manner that imposed significant losses on senior and subordinated debt 

holders led investors to mark down their expectations of government support for 

unsecured non-deposit liabilities, undermining the ability of some other banking 

organizations—including Wachovia, at the time the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets 

—to obtain funding.  On September 29, to avoid serious adverse effects on economic 

                                           
2 Under the AMLF, the Federal Reserve extends non-recourse loans at the primary credit 
rate to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of 
high-quality ABCP from money market mutual funds, thereby assisting money funds that 
hold such paper in meeting demand for redemptions from investors. 
3 Under the MMIFF, the Federal Reserve will provide senior secured funding to a series of 
special purpose vehicles to finance their purchase of certain money market instruments from 
eligible investors.  Eligible assets will include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and 
bank notes issued by highly rated financial institutions with remaining maturities of 90 days 
or less.  Eligible investors will include U.S. MMMFs and over time may include other U.S. 
money market investors.

conditions and financial stability, the Secretary of the Treasury, on the 

recommendation of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve and in consultation with the 

President, invoked the systemic risk exception to facilitate the sale of Wachovia’s 

banking operations to Citigroup.  Under this arrangement, the FDIC committed to 

absorb losses beyond a certain level on a portion of Wachovia’s loans.  However, this 

agreement was subsequently voided when Wells Fargo and Wachovia signed a merger 

agreement in a transaction that required no financial assistance from the FDIC.     

(6) Other financial institutions experienced heightened stress during the 

intermeeting period, most notably Morgan Stanley and several major hedge funds.  

Morgan Stanley was buffeted by uncertainty about whether Mitsubishi UFJ Financial 

Group would close its $9 billion purchase of a 21 percent interest in the firm, a 

transaction that was finally confirmed on October 13.  More recently, investor 

concerns about hedge funds intensified after news surfaced of poor performance at 

Citadel and after Highland Capital Management announced that it was closing two 

funds that had experienced asset value declines in excess of 30 percent this year.    

(7) The equity prices of banks and insurance companies were extremely volatile 

and posted steep declines on net over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting a 

marked deterioration in the outlook for profits.  CDS spreads of Goldman Sachs and 

Morgan Stanley soared in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ collapse.  Those spreads 

narrowed sharply after the two firms converted their nonblank depository institutions 

into commercial banks and were granted bank holding company status by the Federal 

Reserve and following news of capital investments by Berkshire Hathaway and 

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, respectively.  

CDS spreads for commercial banks were also volatile but moved down substantially 

in response to news of the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program and the FDIC’s 

guarantee of selected bank liabilities, ending the intermeeting period about 85 basis 

points lower.  Meanwhile, short-term agency debt spreads widened to well above pre-

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 5 of 45



   

conservatorship levels, reportedly because investors perceived the guarantee of agency 

debt to be weaker than the FDIC’s guarantee of senior unsecured bank debt.  In 

addition, some market participants registered concerns that the credit quality of the 

GSEs could be impaired if they were required to purchase large volumes of subprime 

mortgage assets.  CDS spreads for insurance companies also surged over the 

intermeeting period. 

Market Functioning 

(8) Short-term funding markets came under considerable stress amid 

heightened concerns about counterparty credit risk.  Conditions in unsecured 

interbank funding markets worsened, with spreads of Libor over comparable-maturity 

overnight index swap (OIS) rates rising to unprecedented levels and with very little 

trading taking place at terms beyond overnight (Chart 2).  Strains increased even in 

overnight funding markets, as overnight Libor rose to about 340 basis points above 

the federal funds rate target in early October and overnight federal funds traded 

within an unusually wide range, partly reflecting tiering across institutions.  Conditions 

in very short-term funding markets improved significantly after the European Central 

Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BoE), and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) 

initiated a series of unlimited fixed-rate dollar auctions, and governments in a number 

of countries, including the United States, announced plans to inject capital into 

banking institutions and to guarantee some bank liabilities.  Libor fixings declined 

about 415, 230, and 100 basis points for overnight, one-week, and one-month 

maturities, respectively, starting on October 9.  Conditions in markets for unsecured 

funding for longer terms also improved, but trading reportedly remains very sparse.   

(9) Conditions in secured funding markets were also quite poor.  The overnight 

general collateral repo rate and short-dated Treasury bill yields traded near zero for 

most of the period amid heavy demand for safe investments.  Those low rates

occurred despite issuance by the Treasury of over $500 billion in new bills under the 

Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).  Overnight lending of securities from the 

System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio and fails-to-deliver soared to record 

highs.  To address strains in the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve introduced 

temporary changes in its securities lending program, including a reduction in the fee 

structure and an increase in per-dealer borrowing limits.  In addition, the Treasury 

increased its issuance by reopening several notes that were experiencing severe 

demand imbalances in the market.  These measures, however, had only a modest 

effect on Treasury market trading conditions.  Heightened strains were also evident in 

the markets for repo transactions backed by collateral other than Treasury securities.  

Rates on agency mortgage-backed security (MBS) repos were especially volatile, and 

haircuts applied to a wide range of repo collateral reportedly increased over the past 

few weeks from already elevated levels.  Trading in these non-Treasury repo markets 

remained essentially confined to overnight maturities.   

(10) Conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market continued to be strained, 

as net redemptions of shares in prime MMMFs and concerns among money managers 

about credit quality and liquidity cut into the demand for CP, making issuance 

difficult.  As a result, spreads of ABCP and lower-rated CP rates to the target federal 

funds rate widened sharply, and amounts outstanding in the financial sector continued 

to trend down.  In response to these developments, the Federal Reserve announced 

the establishment of the AMLF, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), and 

the MMIFF.4  Reportedly, some improvements in CP market functioning started to 

                                           
4 On October 7, the Federal Reserve authorized the creation of the CPFF to provide a 
liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle 
(SPV) that will purchase three-month unsecured and asset-backed CP from eligible issuers 
through the primary dealers.  The Federal Reserve will provide overnight financing to the 
SPV under the CPFF at the target federal funds rate and will be secured by all of the assets 
of the SPV.  The Federal Reserve will also be secured by any excess spread and fees that

surface in recent days, perhaps because investors gained comfort from the FDIC 

guarantee of some CP issued by banking organizations and also from the 

announcement of details of the CPFF, which will become operational on October 27.   

(11) The functioning of the CDS market remained far from normal.  Judging 

from the wide range and declining frequency of dealer quotes, both liquidity and price 

discovery was impaired over recent weeks, especially for contracts involving financial 

firms.  The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers created another significant credit event in 

the CDS market and added to stress generated by the placement of Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  Nonetheless, auctions held to determine the 

settlement prices for CDS contracts written on the two GSEs and on Lehman 

Brothers, which were conducted on October 6 and October 10, respectively, were 

successful in facilitating the settlement of a significant number of credit derivative 

trades on these institutions.  The functioning of longer-term corporate debt markets 

also deteriorated over the intermeeting period.  Staff estimates of bid-asked spreads in 

the bond market rose sharply, and in the secondary market for leveraged syndicated 

loans, the average bid-asked spread surged nearly 200 basis points to an 

unprecedented level of 373 basis points in mid-October. 

(12) Depository institutions’ use of the primary credit facility was elevated over 

the intermeeting period, with primary credit outstanding totaling $108 billion as of 

October 22.  The 28-day Term Auction Facility (TAF) auction held on September 22 

was heavily bid, with a stop-out rate of 3.75 percent, more than 50 basis points above 

one-month Libor.  The first 84-day TAF auction that offered $150 billion was 

announced and conducted on October 6; the auction was undersubscribed and 

stopped out at the minimum bid rate of 1.39 percent, perhaps because banks did not 

have sufficient time to post additional collateral ahead of the auction.  The 28-day 

                                                                                                                                        
accumulate in the SPV.  Additional details regarding the CPFF were provided on October 
14. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 9 of 45



   

TAF auction held on October 20, however, also was not fully subscribed and stopped 

out at the minimum bid rate.5  The ten Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) 

auctions conducted over the intermeeting period—three for Schedule 1 and seven for 

Schedule 2 collateral—saw very high demand and stop-out rates that were well above 

the corresponding minimum fee rates.  Dealers mentioned challenging repo market 

conditions and elevated spreads in collateralized markets as possible explanations for 

the strong participation.  On September 24, dealers exercised about $47 billion of the 

nearly $50 billion of TOP options for TSLF loans spanning the September quarter-

end.  The use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) also surged over the 

intermeeting period, and PDCF outstandings were $102 billion as of October 22—

nearly three times the level observed in March and April in the wake of the Bear 

Stearns collapse.  As of October 22, credit extensions under the AMLF totaled $108 

billion, but little new net credit has been extended since October 1.  Credit 

outstanding to AIG stands at about $90 billion.  All told, the sharp increase in 

liquidity provision had a marked impact on the size and the composition of the 

Federal Reserve balance sheet.   

(13) Beginning with the reserve maintenance periods starting October 9, the 

Federal Reserve has paid interest on required reserve and excess balances.  

Nevertheless, partly because of the extremely high provision of liquidity through the 

Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities, the effective federal funds rate has been well 

below the FOMC’s target, with a substantial amount of trading at rates below the 

                                           
5 On October 6, the Federal Reserve boosted the sizes of both the 28-day and 84-day TAF 
auctions to $150 billion each.  These increases will eventually bring the maximum amount 
outstanding under the regular TAF program to $600 billion.  In addition, the sizes of the two 
forward TAF auctions—announced on September 29 and scheduled to be conducted in 
November to extend credit over year-end—were increased to $150 billion each, so that a 
maximum of $900 billion of TAF credit will potentially be outstanding over year-end.

interest rate paid on excess balances.6  However, federal funds futures rates rose 

following the announcement on October 22 that the Federal Reserve had increased 

the rate it would pay on excess balances beginning the following day.7 (See the box 

“Early Experience with Interest on Reserves.”)  

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(14) The intensification of the financial turmoil, the further impairment of the 

functioning of funding markets, and a much weaker economic outlook led investors 

to revise down their expected path for the federal funds rate in the near term and to 

place considerable odds on at least a 25 basis point rate cut at the October 28-29 

FOMC meeting  (Chart 3).  The FOMC’s decision to leave its policy rate unchanged 

at 2 percent at the September meeting took some market participants by surprise and 

led them to scale back their expectations of policy easing over the next year.  

However, policy expectations shifted down in response to the 50 basis point 

intermeeting cut by the FOMC in coordination with other foreign central banks on 

October 8, as market participants were reportedly somewhat surprised by the decision 

and interpreted the language of the accompanying statement as suggesting that further 

easing was likely.  The reaction to both policy actions was soon overshadowed, 

however, by market concerns about the financial sector and the economic outlook.   

(15) Options on federal funds futures suggest that investors currently place high 

odds on the FOMC lowering the federal funds target at the October 28-29 meeting, 

                                           
6 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1.28 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
intraday standard deviation of the funds rate, at about 75 basis points, was extremely 
elevated by historical standards and more than double the level observed in March.  Over 
this intermeeting period, the volume of long-term repurchase agreements declined $10 
billion, and on September 18 the Desk redeemed the full amount of maturing Treasury bill 
holdings, $3.3 billion, to draw reserve from the banking system.    
7 Previously the rate on excess balances had been set at the lowest federal funds rate target 
established by the FOMC during the reserve maintenance period minus 75 basis points.  
Under the revised rule the rate will be set to the lowest target rate minus 35 basis points.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 11 of 45



  
Early Experience with Interest on Reserves 
 
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act accelerated the Federal Reserve’s 
authority to pay interest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions at 
Reserve Banks.  This interest began accruing on October 9.  The payment of interest 
on excess balances should reduce depository institutions’ incentives to sell federal 
funds at rates below the rate paid on excess.  To date, the results of this policy change 
have been mixed, although some evidence suggests that interest on reserves might 
become a more effective tool over time.  
 
The rate paid on excess balances has not established a hard floor to the federal funds 
rate.  Initially, this rate was set equal to the lowest targeted federal funds rate for the 
maintenance period less 75 basis points, resulting in a rate of 75 basis points.  From 
October 9 to October 22, an average of 35 percent of brokered federal funds trades 
transacted at rates below 75 basis points.  However, the share of brokered trades at 
rates near zero has declined substantially.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two large net 
sellers of funds in the market, are not eligible to receive interest on the balances they 
hold and are reportedly selling funds at rates below 75 basis points.  In addition, some 
small depository institutions have also been selling funds at rates below 75 basis 
points.  Some of these institutions may believe that their correspondent banks will not 
pass on interest earned on excess balances and thus are willing to sell federal funds at 
rates below the rate paid on excess balances.  To foster trading at rates closer to the 
target rate, the Board narrowed the spread between the target federal funds rate and 
the rate paid on excess balances to 35 basis points effective October 23.  
 
Market participants may still be adapting to the new system.  In principle, arbitrage 
should keep market rates close to the rate paid on excess balances if enough 
institutions that are eligible to receive interest were to bid for the funds of ineligible 
institutions.  Indeed, a couple of large banks are apparently doing so now and in some 
volume, and this pattern may strengthen over time.  In addition, correspondent 
banking agreements may be restructured in light of the payment of interest to 
respondent banks.  Some respondent institutions are reportedly considering 
terminating their correspondent relationships and holding balances directly with the 
Reserve Banks.  
 
One potentially related development is a significant decline in the volume of brokered 
transactions in the federal funds market.  With the extraordinary level of balances in 
the system, and the ability to earn significant interest on an essentially risk-free asset, 
the incentive for institutions to trade in the overnight market may have diminished.

assigning odds of roughly 25, 40, and 20 percent, respectively to a 25, 50, and 75 basis 

point rate cut, and about 10 percent odds to no change in the policy rate.  However, 

these probabilities may be distorted to some extent by expectations that the effective 

funds rate will continue to trade below the target for a while.  Responses to the Desk’s 

primary dealer survey on October 20—which were not affected by this factor 

although they may now be somewhat stale—indicate that dealers place 38 percent 

probabilities on a 25 and 50 basis point rate cut, a 3 percent probability on a 75 basis 

point rate cut, and a 20 percent probability on no change.  Further ahead, futures 

quotes suggest that investors expect the FOMC to begin tightening by the spring of 

2009, with the federal funds rate returning to a level of about 1.5 percent by the end 

of 2009 and 2.75 percent by the end of 2010.  However, these estimates may also be 

distorted; term premiums resulting from heightened market volatility and poor 

functioning in other financial markets may be substantially higher than currently 

assumed by the staff, which would imply a lower long-term trajectory for the expected 

funds rate.  Uncertainty about the federal funds rate six months ahead increased over 

the intermeeting period, as indicated by the widening of the option-implied 

probability distribution at this horizon.     

(16) Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined 36 basis points on net over the 

intermeeting period amid heavy safe-haven demand and in response to the downward 

shift in policy expectations and the economic outlook.  In contrast, ten-year nominal 

yields rose 50 basis points, likely reflecting expectations for increased Treasury 

issuance to finance federal government asset purchases and other activities, and 

perhaps also increased uncertainty about the future course of interest rates, which may 

have boosted term premiums.  Standard measures of inflation compensation based on 

differences between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury yields were extremely 

volatile over the intermeeting period.  On net, inflation compensation over the next 

five years fell about 147 basis points, while it rose 41 basis points five to ten years 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 14 of 45



   

ahead.  Inferences about inflation expectations from these figures should be made 

cautiously, however, as market yields were likely heavily affected by large increases in 

liquidity premiums in TIPS yields and by supply effects on nominal Treasury yields.  

Measures of inflation compensation obtained from inflation swaps, by contrast, 

posted modest declines across the term structure and appeared more consistent with 

the mixed changes in inflation expectations in the Reuters/Michigan survey and the 

roughly $25 per barrel decrease in the price of crude oil over the intermeeting period.  

In addition, respondents to the Desk’s survey expect a lower rate of CPI inflation 

from five to ten years ahead. 

Capital Markets 

(17) As the financial turmoil intensified and the economic outlook deteriorated 

over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes dropped substantially on net 

amid very high volatility (Chart 4).  Stock price declines were widespread across 

sectors.  Financial firms notably underperformed for most of the period, although 

they recently moved back more closely in line with broad indexes.  With the earnings 

reporting season just getting under way, analysts currently expect earnings per share 

for the S&P 500 to be about 3 percent lower than year-ago levels, pulled down mostly 

by decreases at financial firms.  For the roughly 75 percent of publicly traded banking 

organizations that have reported earnings to date (excluding three financial 

institutions that will be acquired in the near term—Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, and 

Sovereign), third-quarter earnings were slightly negative.  Weak third-quarter results 

were attributed to write-downs on security holdings and to continued loan loss 

provisioning to offset increased credit losses on a variety of loans.  In contrast, 

earnings at nonfinancial firms are expected to come in about 12 percent above year-

ago levels, with gains largely accounted for by the oil and gas sectors.  Looking ahead, 

analysts marked down their projections for earnings over the coming year significantly

for both financial and nonfinancial firms.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 

surged to a record level, well above its previous high in 1998, and the spread between 

the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and the real 

long-term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity premium—reached the highest 

level since the start of the series in 1982. 

(18) Conditions in corporate debt markets tightened further over the 

intermeeting period.  Risk spreads on investment- and speculative-grade bonds soared 

to historically high levels.  The increases appeared to reflect upward revisions to 

expected losses as well as a further widening of already elevated risk premiums.  Gross 

bond issuance by investment-grade nonfinancial firms has been moderate, and 

issuance of speculative-grade bonds has been nil.  Conditions in the leveraged 

syndicated loan market also deteriorated sharply over the period.  In particular, the 

secondary market average bid price plunged an unprecedented 15 points, to nearly 70, 

reportedly due to heavy sales by hedge funds and unwinds of total return swaps and 

market-value collateralized loan obligations.  The implied spread on an index of loan 

credit default swaps (the LCDX) almost doubled, on net, to about 800 basis points 

over the period.  Finally, hedge fund performance continued to deteriorate over the 

past few weeks, with the Global Hedge Fund Index tumbling more than 10 percent.  

(19) The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages increased, on 

net, about 50 basis points to almost 6.5 percent in mid-October.   The mortgage rate 

had nearly returned to the very elevated levels seen just before Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac were taken into conservatorship in early September, but has reversed 

most of that rise over the past week.  MBS spreads were extremely volatile amid 

reportedly poor trading conditions.  Meanwhile, interest rates on nonconforming 

jumbo mortgages remained extremely high.  Delinquency rates for prime and 

subprime mortgages increased further.  Issuance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 

MBS in September increased slightly but remained below the pace seen in the first 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 17 of 45



   

half of the year, while issuance by Ginnie Mae has stayed elevated; the Federal 

Reserve purchased $14.5 billion in agency discount notes over the intermeeting 

period.  Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by consumer credit 

declined notably in the third quarter, at least partly as a result of historically high 

spreads.  

(20) Conditions in the municipal bond market deteriorated substantially in recent 

weeks, although there appears to have been some improvement recently.  Variable-

rate demand notes and tender option bonds reportedly were put back to liquidity 

providers, who in turn sold the underlying long-term bonds in the secondary market, 

putting pressure on prices and market functioning.  Amid the resulting unfavorable 

climate, issuance of longer-term municipal bonds slowed markedly in September and 

early October.  The credit quality of municipal bonds also deteriorated in the third 

quarter, and the number of downgrades far outpaced the number of upgrades.  Yield 

ratios on municipal bonds spiked to record levels, although the short-term ratio 

retraced somewhat in the last few days of the period.   

Foreign Developments 

(21) The unfolding financial crisis affected financial markets across the globe 

over the intermeeting period, intensifying in Europe and spreading to markets in the 

emerging market economies as well.  Spreads over OIS rates of term sterling and term 

euro rates rose sharply from their already elevated levels following the collapse of 

Lehman Brothers and difficulties at AIG, although the increase was less pronounced 

than in comparable dollar markets.  To address the growing global strain in dollar 

funding markets, the Federal Reserve progressively increased the sizes of its reciprocal 

currency swap lines with foreign central banks and boosted the number of central 

bank counterparties (Australia, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, 

and Denmark were added).  Late in the period, in connection with these swap 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 18 of 45



   

arrangements, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National 

Bank, and the Bank of Japan began to conduct auctions of dollar liquidity with 7-day, 

28-day, and 84-day maturities at pre-announced fixed interest rates, with funding 

being made available to fully meet the quantities demanded by borrowers in 

possession of eligible collateral.  Additionally, the Swiss National Bank announced 

plans to draw on its swap line to help finance up to $60 billion in purchases of assets 

from a major Swiss bank.  

(22) In early October, amid declines in confidence and increasingly constricted 

access to funding, several high-profile banks in Europe were on the verge of failure, 

prompting nationalizations and capital injections by their respective governments.  A 

pullback from risk in virtually all advanced and emerging market economies had 

induced plunges in stock prices, sharp swings in exchange rates, large increases in risk 

spreads, and an almost complete seizing-up of credit markets (Chart 5).  Subsequently, 

authorities in many foreign industrial countries, as well as in the United States, 

announced a series of measures of unprecedented scale and scope designed to support 

the banking system and restore the functioning of credit markets.  Since these 

announcements, conditions in short-term funding markets, as evidenced by Libor to 

OIS spreads, have improved somewhat.  Equity prices initially moved up in most 

markets, but they continued to swing wildly thereafter as investors focused on the 

risks of global recession.  On net, over the intermeeting period, equity indexes in most 

advanced and developing countries declined 20 percent or more.  Interest rates on 

sovereign bonds in industrial countries exhibited substantial volatility, and nominal 

yield curves steepened as two-year yields declined while ten-year yields were mixed.  

In developing countries, sovereign credit spreads rose sharply, leading several 

countries to postpone scheduled sales of debt.    

(23) The major currencies index of the dollar rose sharply over the period, 

increasing 9 percent on net, as the dollar appeared to benefit from the global decrease

in risk appetite.  An exception was the dollar’s 7 percent depreciation versus the yen, 

which apparently reflected a rapid unwinding of yen carry-trade positions.  Implied 

volatilities in most currency pairs rose to multi-year highs, making hedging currency 

risk far more costly.  The dollar appreciated 9 percent against the currencies of our 

other important trading partners over the period.  Most notably, the dollar rose about 

25 percent against the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, and 21 percent versus the 

Korean won, despite reports of heavy intervention sales of dollars by the monetary 

authorities of these countries.  The dollar’s especially sharp increase against the 

currencies of emerging market economies likely reflected investors’ pulling back from 

risk, although in some cases sharp declines in commodity prices likely also contributed 

to the weakening of those currencies. 

Debt and Money 

(24) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to have expanded at 

a 9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, almost twice as fast as the average pace in 

the first half of the year and 5 percentage points greater than the pace reported in the 

previous Bluebook (Chart 6).  The pickup was attributable almost entirely to increased 

borrowing by the federal government related to the Supplemental Financing Program 

and the TARP.  In contrast, the rate of debt growth in the business and household 

sectors is estimated to have slowed.  As already noted, in the nonfinancial business 

sector, investment-grade bond issuance was moderate and speculative-grade bond 

issuance was nil, perhaps due to extremely high interest rates and risk spreads.  By 

contrast, commercial paper outstanding rose despite the extremely impaired market 

conditions.  In the leveraged loan market, institutional issuance reportedly continued 

to be very weak.  Household debt continued to slow as falling house prices weighed 

on mortgage borrowing and the weakness in consumption spending trimmed 

consumer credit growth.

(25) Commercial bank credit surged in mid-September, boosted by increases in 

“other loans,” banks’ holdings of securities, and commercial and industrial (C&I) 

loans.  The “other loans” category saw a marked increase in unplanned overdrafts by 

a wide range of customers, including money fund complexes, as well as draws on lines 

of credit by financial firms, consistent with the stress in funding markets.  Commercial 

banks’ acquisition of a large volume of non-agency and non-Treasury securities likely 

reflected in part purchases of CP stimulated by the AMLF program.  The increase in 

C&I loans was reportedly due mostly to draw downs on pre-existing lines of credit; 

however, some respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that 

they had also increased loans not made under previous commitment.  Very large 

fractions of the surveyed banks reported having tightened terms and standards on a 

broad range of loan types for both businesses and households.       

(26)  M2 expanded at a rapid 15½ percent annual rate in September and is 

estimated to have accelerated further to a 17 percent pace in October.  Liquid 

deposits surged in September reflecting, in part, robust expansions in the deposits of 

broker-dealers, trusts, and corporate customers at a few large banks.  Small time 

deposits increased sharply in September and are set to post dramatic gains in October, 

as banks and thrifts reportedly continued to bid aggressively for these deposits.  By 

contrast, liquid deposits slowed almost to a halt this month.  Retail money funds were 

about flat in September but appear to be expanding briskly in October.  Currency 

growth picked up in September and has risen further in October, apparently reflecting 

increased domestic and foreign demand.  Overall, money growth may be being 

boosted by some reallocation of household assets toward safer instruments; stock and 

bond mutual funds, for example, have registered substantial runoffs over recent 

weeks. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 23 of 45



   

Economic Outlook 

(27) The staff has marked down sharply its outlook for economic growth in the 

second half of 2008 and in 2009.  Consumer outlays, housing starts, and business 

investment in equipment and structures all have been weaker than we projected in 

September.  Moreover, financial turmoil has intensified, and banks further tightened 

credit terms and standards for households and businesses in the third quarter.  As a 

consequence, the forecast now assumes that the Committee will lower the target 

federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, 25 basis points at the December 

meeting, and another 25 basis points at the January meeting.  The target funds rate is 

assumed to remain at ½ percent through mid-2010 and then begin a gradual ascent.  

Long-term Treasury yields are projected to be flat over the next two years.  Although 

yields would tend to rise over time as the maturity window moves through the period 

of low short-term rates prevailing over the next few years, we assume that this effect 

will be offset as market participants revise down their policy expectations toward the 

path incorporated in our baseline forecast.  Fixed mortgage rates and corporate bond 

yields are projected to decline as economic conditions gradually improve and the 

extreme aversion to risk-taking recedes.  Stock prices rise at a 12 percent annual rate 

in 2009 and 2010 from a starting point that is 23 percent lower than in the previous 

forecast; this path implies that the equity premium narrows significantly but remains 

at historically high levels over the next two years.  The real trade-weighted dollar is 

projected to depreciate nearly 3 percent in 2009 and almost 4 percent in 2010.  In line 

with futures quotes, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil is expected to rise 

slowly from $74 per barrel in the current quarter to $83 per barrel by the end of 2010, 

a level that is almost $25 per barrel lower than in the September forecast. 

(28) Against this backdrop, the projected path for output follows a notably lower 

trajectory than in the last forecast; real GDP is now estimated to have contracted at an 

annual rate of 1 percent in the third quarter of 2008 and is projected to decline at 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 45



   

average annual rates of about 1¼ percent in the current quarter and 1½ percent in the 

first quarter of 2009.  Over the remainder of 2009, GDP is projected to grow at an 

annual rate of only ¼ percent, held down by tight lending standards and strained 

financial conditions that improve only slowly.  In 2010, as financial strains continue to 

ebb, GDP expands at its potential growth rate of 2¼ percent.  As a consequence of 

the economic weakness through the end of next year, the unemployment rate rises to 

7¼ percent by the end of 2009, about 2½ percentage points above the staff’s estimate 

of the NAIRU.  This substantial amount of slack, coupled with a lower path for 

energy prices, leads to a marked deceleration in prices.  Core PCE inflation, which is 

projected at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the current quarter, moderates to 1½ 

percent in 2009 and 1¼ percent in 2010.  The recent drop in energy prices should 

cause overall consumer prices to fall at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the current 

quarter; overall prices increase about 1½ percent on average.  

Monetary Policy Strategies 

(29) As shown in Chart 7, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* has 

been revised down about 2¾ percentage points since the September Bluebook.  It 

now stands at about -3 percent, several percentage points below its value at the 

previous cyclical trough in mid-2003.  The magnitude of the downward shift since the 

last Bluebook reflects the sharp deterioration in the staff’s outlook for aggregate 

demand: The severity of strains in domestic financial markets has translated into a 

marked fall in equity prices, higher corporate bonds rates, and tighter credit 

conditions for households and businesses; and the intensification of global financial 

market turmoil, a higher dollar and weaker foreign activity have led to less favorable 

prospects for the demand for U.S. exports.  The estimate of short-run r* from the 

small structural model—which incorporates these financial pressures only through the 

effects of a wider equity premium—has moved down about 110 basis points since the

last Bluebook to around -3 percent.  By comparison, the estimate of short-run r* from 

the FRB/US model—which incorporates shifts in other risk premiums as well as the 

effects of shocks to foreign demand—has fallen about 375 basis points since the 

September Bluebook and is now at -5.4 percent.  The actual real federal funds rate has 

declined about ½ percentage point since the last meeting, reflecting the Committee’s 

policy action on October 8, and now stands at -1 percent.  

(30) Chart 8 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using the 

long-run Greenbook forecast beyond 2010.8  These simulations impose a lower 

bound of zero on the nominal funds rate and abstract from any potential stimulus 

from non-standard policy tools (see box on “Possible Constraints on Monetary Policy 

at Very Low Nominal Interest Rates”).  For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 

2 percent (the left-hand and right-hand sets of charts, respectively), the optimal 

control simulations prescribe a trajectory for the federal funds rate that declines to the 

zero lower bound by mid-2009 and remains at that rate through mid-2012.  Optimal 

policy is significantly constrained by the zero lower bound in these simulations; 

indeed, the funds rate would fall much further if the zero lower bound were not 

imposed on the optimal control policy.9  Because monetary policy is unable to provide 

adequate stimulus over the next several years, the unemployment rate rises to around 

7 percent next year and remains above the NAIRU through 2012.  Given the 

persistence of this slack, core PCE inflation troughs near 1¼ percent in early 2012.  

Under either inflation objective, the economy is still not in equilibrium after five years, 

and further adjustments in policy are needed to ensure that inflation ultimately settles 

down at the desired rate and output returns to its balanced-growth path. 

                                           
8 In these simulations, policymakers place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding changes 
in the nominal funds rate.

Possible Constraints on Monetary Policy at Very Low Nominal Interest Rates 

Given the recent sharp deterioration in the economic outlook, the Committee may see  
a real possibility of substantial further easing of monetary policy in coming quarters,  
with the federal funds rate falling to record lows.1  For example, under the staff’s baseline  
outlook, optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model bring the funds rate to zero  
and maintain that rate into 2012 (Chart 8), while the empirical outcome-based rule prescribes 
a zero funds rate from mid-2009 to late 2010 (Chart 9); indeed, the funds rate would become 
negative in those simulations if a lower bound of zero were not imposed. 

The lower bound on short-term nominal interest rates arises from the fact that investors  
can always choose to hold currency, which pays a zero interest rate, instead of other  
financial assets.  In principle, this lower bound could be slightly negative, because holding 
large amounts of cash incurs storage and security costs that reduce its effective rate of  
return below zero.  In practice, however, a target of zero percent for the federal funds rate 
might well be associated with slightly positive effective rates, reflecting compensation for 
risk in interbank lending.  In Japan, for example, the one-week interbank rate was typically  
at a few basis points from March 2001 to July 2006—a period when the Bank of Japan  
kept the overnight call rate at zero—while the magnitude of occasional spikes was limited  
by the discount rate, which was maintained a notch higher at 10 basis points.  

Reducing the funds rate to very low levels could have significant effects on the functioning 
of various financial markets and institutions and might well trigger substantial structural 
changes, especially if very low rates were maintained for a substantial period.  Transactions 
volumes in money markets likely would diminish significantly.  Yields on assets held  
in money market mutual funds might not be high enough to cover the overhead costs  
of managing those funds.  In the short run, funds might have to waive those management 
fees, and over time the industry might need to move to an explicit fee structure analogous to 
that already in effect for some types of deposits at commercial banks.  Given that overnight 
interest charges would not provide any incentive to deliver on promised Treasury securities, 
fails-to-deliver in the Treasury market would likely become increasingly pervasive. Such 
developments could initially prove disruptive but might eventually lead market participants 
to incorporate explicit penalties for failures to deliver.   

Even when the setting of the nominal interest rate is constrained by the zero lower bound,  
a central bank can use other tools to provide monetary stimulus.  One such approach, 
known as quantitative easing, involves the injection of additional liquidity into the banking 
system beyond that required for keeping the overnight interbank rate at zero.  However,  
the evidence from the Japanese experience with quantitative easing—in which excess 
reserves expanded from a negligible quantity in early 2001 to about five times the level  
of required reserves by late 2003—suggests that this approach may have little or no effect  
on bank lending, although it may have provided some stimulus by exerting downward 
pressure on the yen.  A more promising approach might be to aim at reducing term and  
risk premiums on various financial assets by purchasing those assets in sufficiently large 
quantities.  Event studies suggest that large changes in the relative supply of securities have 
had economically significant effects on their yields. 
1 The effective federal funds rate was about ¾ percent for a few months in 1954 and again in 1958. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 29 of 45



   

(31) As depicted in Chart 9, given the staff’s forecast the outcome-based policy 

rule prescribes a funds rate that drops to the zero bound by mid-2009 and stays there 

through 2010 before steadily rising to about 4¾ percent by the end of 2013.  Over 

much of the period, this trajectory is substantially lower than the one currently 

embedded in financial market quotes, under which the funds rate declines to 0.75 

percent in 2009Q1 before rising to a plateau of about 4 percent starting in 2011.  

Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model using the staff’s baseline outlook and 

the outcome-based rule indicate a very high probability that the funds rate hits and 

stays at the zero bound between mid-2009 and the end of 2010.10  In contrast, 

information from interest rate caps indicates that investors see a relatively high 

likelihood of substantial monetary policy tightening starting in the second half of 

2009.11   

(32) As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 9, the near-term prescriptions from 

the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules are markedly lower than in the previous Bluebook, 

reflecting the pronounced widening of the output gap and improved readings on core 

inflation.  While these rules depend solely on the current output gap and the rate of 

core inflation that has occurred over the past year, the first-difference rule depends on 

three-quarter-ahead forecasts for output growth and core inflation; hence, for either 

inflation goal, this rule prescribes a declining funds rates trajectory that reaches the 

zero bound by the first quarter of 2009.   

                                           
10 The stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model also incorporate the zero bound 
constraint on the nominal funds rate, and hence the 70 and 90 percent confidence intervals 
are truncated at zero from the second half of 2009 through mid-2012. 
11 The probability of low interest rates may be underestimated because the confidence 
intervals shown in the top right panel of Chart 9 are computed from interest rate caps with 
strike prices between 1 percent and 14 percent.  Interest rate caps with a strike price below 1 
percent are not currently traded.

Policy Alternatives 

(33) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A 

the federal funds rate target is cut 50 basis points to 1 percent; under Alternative B the 

federal funds rate target is cut 25 basis points to 1¼ percent; and under Alternative C 

the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at 1½ percent.  All three alternatives 

begin by noting the deterioration in financial conditions and the weakened economic 

outlook.  Alternatives B and C note the plethora of recent policy actions around the 

world, suggesting that these actions will help to promote a return to moderate 

economic growth; Alternative A includes no language to soften its negative view of 

the outlook for economic activity.  With respect to inflation, Alternatives A and B 

express confidence that inflation will moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent 

with price stability, whereas Alternative C retains the phrasing from the statement 

following the intermeeting cut on October 8, which acknowledges reduced upside 

risks to inflation without commenting on its likely future path. 

(34) If the Committee believes that further monetary policy accommodation is 

appropriate given the deterioration in the economic outlook, but wishes to adjust 

policy relatively gradually, it may want to reduce the target federal funds rate 25 basis 

points at this meeting as in Alternative B.  Even if members have not revised down 

their forecast for economic activity as much as the staff, they may still believe that 

easing is called for.  In view of the negative tone of the recent economic data, the 

worsening of financial conditions since mid-September, and the reduction of 

inflationary pressures implied by the large drop in energy prices and the outlook for 

significant economic slack, members may view the 50 basis point intermeeting move 

in early October as only a partial step toward suitably balancing the risks to the 

outlook and think that that action should be augmented with a further policy 

adjustment at this meeting.  At the same time, members may be less pessimistic about

Policy 
Decision 

1. The Federal Open Market 
Committee has decided to lower its 
target for the federal funds rate 50 
basis points to 1½ percent. 

The Federal Open Market Committee 
decided today to lower its target for 
the federal funds rate 50 basis points 
to 1 percent. 

The Federal Open Market Committee 
decided today to lower its target for 
the federal funds rate 25 basis points 
to 1¼ percent.  

The Federal Open Market Committee 
decided today to keep its target for the 
federal funds rate at 1½ percent. 

2.   The Committee took this action in 
light of evidence pointing to a 
weakening of economic activity and 
a reduction in inflationary pressures. 
Incoming economic data suggest 
that the pace of economic activity 
has slowed markedly in recent 
months.  Moreover, the 
intensification of financial market 
turmoil is likely to exert additional 
restraint on spending, partly by 
further reducing the ability of 
households and businesses to obtain 
credit. 

The outlook for economic activity has 
weakened, and downside risks to 
growth appear to have increased.  
Consumer spending and industrial 
production have declined in recent 
months, and slowing economic activity 
in many foreign economies is damping 
the prospects for U.S. exports.  
Moreover, the intensification of 
financial market turmoil is likely to 
exert additional restraint on spending, 
partly by further reducing the ability of 
households and businesses to obtain 
credit.  

The pace of economic activity appears 
to have slowed markedly, owing 
importantly to a decline in consumer 
expenditures.  Moreover, the 
intensification of financial market 
turmoil is likely to exert additional 
restraint on spending, partly by further 
reducing the ability of households and 
businesses to obtain credit. 

Reflecting in part the intensification of 
financial market turmoil, the outlook for 
economic activity has weakened.  
Consumer spending and industrial 
production have declined in recent 
months.  However, policy actions taken 
in recent weeks, including coordinated 
interest rate cuts by central banks, 
extraordinary liquidity measures, and 
official steps to strengthen financial 
systems, should help over time to 
improve credit conditions and promote a 
return to moderate economic growth.   

Rationale 

3.   Inflation has been high, but the 
Committee believes that the decline 
in energy and other commodity 
prices and the weaker prospects for 
economic activity have reduced the 
upside risks to inflation. 

In light of the declines in the prices of 
energy and other commodities and the 
weaker prospects for economic 
activity, the Committee expects 
inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consistent with price 
stability.

Inflation has been high, but the 
Committee believes that the declines in 
the prices of energy and other 
commodities and the weaker prospects

upside risks to inflation. 

Assessment 
of Risk 

4.   The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial 
developments carefully and will act 
as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability. 

The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial developments 
carefully and will act as needed to 
promote sustainable economic growth 
and price stability. 

Policy actions taken in recent weeks, 
including coordinated interest rate cuts 
by central banks, extraordinary 
liquidity measures, and official steps to 
strengthen financial systems, should 
help over time to improve credit 
conditions and promote a return to 
moderate economic growth.  
Nevertheless, significant downside 
risks to growth remain.  The 
Committee will monitor economic and 
financial developments carefully and 
will act as needed to promote 
sustainable economic growth and price 
stability. 

In these circumstances, the Committee’s 
primary concern is the downside risks to 
growth.  The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial developments 
carefully in light of the recent policy 
actions and will act as needed to 
promote sustainable economic growth 
and price stability.

the outlook than the staff for several reasons and hence believe that more limited 

policy action than assumed in the Greenbook is appropriate.  For example, they may 

believe that financial conditions will improve sooner than assumed by the staff, as in 

the Greenbook’s “More Rapid Financial Recovery” scenario.  Or, they may think that 

passage of a second fiscal stimulus package is likely and perhaps that such a package 

could be larger or more potent than those presented in the Greenbook’s “Fiscal 

Stimulus” scenarios.  Although these Greenbook alternative scenarios indicate that 

more policy easing would still be desirable, they might suggest less urgency to take 

further large steps.  Alternatively, should the Committee share the staff’s downbeat 

economic outlook but see a near-term reversal of policy as costly, members might 

view a series of gradual steps as more prudent than one or two large moves because 

there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, particularly concerning the 

effects of the many official actions recently implemented.  

(35) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative B would 

begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity, pointing 

specifically to the softening in consumer spending.  The statement would also point 

out that financial market strains have intensified and that the resulting tightening of 

credit conditions is likely to impose additional restraint on spending.  The paragraph 

on inflation would note that recent declines in the prices of energy and other 

commodities, along with greater prospective economic slack, should cause inflation to 

moderate to levels consistent with price stability.  (See the box “Likely Market 

Interpretation of Price Stability Language.”)  The change in wording, from reduced 

upside risks in the October 8 statement to an expected moderation of inflation in the 

language for Alternative B, suggests that Committee members have become much 

more confident that inflation will decline.  The final paragraph would note the 

numerous policy steps already taken in recent weeks to increase liquidity in financial 

markets, strengthen financial systems around the world, and promote economic 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 34 of 45



   

growth.  While indicating that these actions should support economic activity going 

forward, the statement also notes that they have not eliminated downside risks.  The 

statement concludes with the final sentence of the October 8 statement, highlighting 

the Committee’s intention to act as needed in support of its objectives. 

 

(36) According to the Desk’s survey on October 20, primary dealers assigned 

roughly 40 percent probabilities to both 25 basis point and 50 basis point cuts in the 

federal funds target at this meeting, with a 20 percent probability of no change.  The 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 35 of 45



   

mean of dealers’ expectations for the target funds rate was 1.2 percent, which is 

slightly above the rate of 1.1 percent implied by federal funds futures contracts at the 

time of the Desk’s survey.  Because futures contracts refer to the effective funds rate 

rather than the target rate, the difference between the dealer expectations and the 

futures rate may reflect the possibility that federal funds will continue to trade below 

the target in coming weeks; 12 it is likely that at the time of the Desk’s survey, both 

dealers and futures market participants expected a cut in the target funds rate of about 

30 basis points.  However, over subsequent days, rates on federal funds futures 

contracts closing after the October meeting have declined another 10 basis points 

amid investor concerns about the economic outlook, and they now suggest 

expectations of about 40 basis points of easing at the upcoming meeting.  Thus, a 25 

basis point cut to 1¼ percent would leave the target federal funds rate somewhat 

above current market expectations.  Nevertheless, the clear shift in the statement 

language away from concern about inflation risks and toward an emphasis on growth 

risks would likely lead investors to anticipate further rate cuts, and this alternative 

appears broadly consistent with readings for the funds rate at the end of the year that 

are implied by futures markets.  As a result, our best estimate is that adoption of 

Alternative B would have only small effects on prices of financial assets.  

(37)  If the Committee, like the staff, has marked down significantly its 

assessment of economic prospects and now sees an immediate and substantial policy 

response as appropriate, it may want to reduce the target federal funds rate 50 basis 

points at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Recent economic data releases have been 

almost all weaker than anticipated, with consumer outlays down sharply.  Moreover, 

financial conditions have deteriorated substantially since the September meeting:  

Equity prices fell sharply over the intermeeting period; mortgage rates moved higher; 
                                           
12 The October 22 announcement of a decrease in the spread between the target federal 
funds rate and the rate of interest paid on excess reserve balances had little apparent effect 
on futures rates. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 36 of 45



   

corporate bond yields jumped; and the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

shows that extraordinarily high percentages of banks tightened standards and terms 

on loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  With regard to 

inflation, the latest news on commodity prices and inflation expectations, in 

conjunction with the appreciation of the dollar in recent months and the likelihood of 

a marked increase in economic slack, provides substantial assurance that inflation will 

moderate.  Even if the Committee has not marked down its outlook for the economy 

as much as the staff, it may view the downside risks as having increased.  Moreover, 

with the Greenbook-consistent measure of the equilibrium real funds rate having 

dropped about 2 percentage points below the level of the current real rate, even a less 

pessimistic outlook than the Greenbook’s could be consistent with a considerable 

further reduction in the target federal funds rate.  

(38) The rationale section of the statement for Alternative A highlights the 

recent deterioration in financial and economic conditions, with specific references to 

weak consumer spending and industrial production and to the slowdown in foreign 

economic growth.  As under Alternative B, the section also points out the likely future 

spending restraint implied by the further tightening of financial conditions.  The 

discussion of inflation would be identical to that under Alternative B, noting the 

reasons to expect a moderation of inflation to levels consistent with price stability.  

The assessment of risk would emphasize the Committee’s readiness to act as needed 

to promote growth.  

(39) A 50 basis point cut is near the high end of market expectations for policy 

easing at this meeting.  Moreover, the statement language suggests that the Committee 

is prepared to reduce rates further, and thus market participants would presumably 

lower their expected trajectory for the federal funds rate over the next few quarters.  

Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would probably drop noticeably.  Long-

term interest rates might decline modestly, though if market participants interpret the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 37 of 45



   

statement as a sign that the Committee is underestimating inflation risks, long-term 

rates could rise.  The effect on equity prices would depend on whether markets are 

comforted by the prospect of more monetary ease or concerned by the gloomy 

assessment of the outlook and risks. 

(40) If the Committee believes that the economic outlook has not deteriorated as 

much as in the staff forecast or that there is still a significant risk that inflation will not 

moderate as expected, it might prefer to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in 

Alternative C.  Although recent readings on real activity have been very weak, a wide 

range of monetary and other policy measures have been implemented recently, and 

members may feel that a gradual improvement of financial conditions could be in 

train.  Indeed, many yield spreads have been narrowing and liquidity measures have 

been improving gradually in recent days, albeit from highly strained levels.  If this 

process continues in coming weeks, the cumulative improvement in financial 

conditions could be substantial.  Also, the Committee may place a high probability on 

a major new fiscal stimulus package being enacted soon; no fiscal package was 

factored into the staff’s projection.  Moreover, members may be skeptical of the staff 

projection of a sharp reduction in inflation, perhaps feeling that it is based on 

assumptions that may prove to be overly optimistic.  For example, the Committee 

may not have confidence in the sharply lower trajectory for energy prices suggested by 

futures markets; energy prices are highly volatile and futures market quotes over the 

past few years have been unreliable guides to subsequent developments.  And some 

members may not put much stock in the notion that slack in labor and product 

markets will restrain future price pressures, but may instead worry that a very low 

funds rate will fuel rising inflation expectations, as illustrated in the Greenbook’s 

“Faster Inflation” scenario.  Indeed, members may want to see several months of 

lower data on inflation and inflation expectations before they feel comfortable with 

further reductions in the policy target.

(41) The first part of the rationale portion of the statement associated with 

Alternative C would acknowledge the recent deterioration in economic and financial 

conditions.  The second part would point to the wide range of recent policy actions, 

noting that they should help to promote growth over time.  The discussion of the 

outlook for inflation would be essentially identical to that in the October 8 statement, 

which focused on a reduction in upside risks rather than a material reduction in the 

modal forecast.  Finally, the risk assessment under Alternative C begins by stating that 

the balance of risks has shifted toward downside risks to growth.  The section 

concludes with a modification of the risk assessment of the October 8 statement, 

pointing to the possible effects of past policy actions as something the Committee will 

be watching particularly closely.   

(42) Given the high odds embedded in financial market prices of at least a 25 

basis point cut at this meeting, a decision to adopt Alternative C would surprise 

market participants, leading to an appreciable upward revision of their short-term 

outlook for the path of policy and probably an increase in short-and intermediate-

term interest rates.  Equity prices would likely fall, perhaps substantially.  Financial 

market strains would probably increase and private yields would rise. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(43) M2 is projected to grow at a 7½ percent annual rate this year, significantly 

above the rate anticipated in September and faster than the projected growth rate of 

nominal GDP.  The major factor behind rapid growth of M2 this year is the decline in 

short-term interest rates and the associated drop in the opportunity cost of holding 

M2 assets.  A portfolio shift toward safe and liquid assets may also be playing a role.  

M2 is projected to decelerate to a pace of roughly 3 percent in 2009 and 2010, 

reflecting weak growth in nominal GDP in 2009 and a rising opportunity cost in 2010. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 39 of 45



   

(44) Debt growth in the private sector is expected to be weak over the next two 

years.  Household debt is projected to be essentially flat in 2009 and to expand only a 

little in 2010, held down by falling home prices and tighter bank lending terms and 

standards.  Nonfinancial business debt is projected to grow at a moderate rate, down 

sharply from rapid growth rates in recent years, also restrained in part by tight credit 

conditions.  By contrast, debt is projected to grow rapidly in the government sectors, 

as the economic slowdown damps revenues, and as financing needs related to the 

TARP, Treasury’s assistance to the GSEs, and higher expected losses at the FDIC 

boost federal debt substantially in 2009 and 2010.  Overall, domestic nonfinancial 

debt is projected to grow 2¾ percent in 2009 and 4¼ percent in 2010, a very subdued 

pace by historical standards.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.   
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
   

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each estimate of the 
real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( y y *t t−  and y y *t t+ +1| − t 1|t ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (Δ −4 4y y *t t+ +3| Δ t 3|t ), and π *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

Outcome-based rule it

 

 =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
