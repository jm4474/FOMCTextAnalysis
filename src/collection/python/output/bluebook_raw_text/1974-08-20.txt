Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M1 increased at about a 1 per cent annual rate in July, but

preliminary data for early August suggest a pick-up in growth, For the two

months together, M1 growth is expected to average around 3 per cent, in the

lower part of the Committee's range of tolerance. 1/ Growth in M2 has been

closer to the mid-point of its range of tolerance, as time deposits other

than money market CD's have been rising about as projected. RPD is now ex-

pected to expand at a rate in the lower part of its tolerance range,

reflecting a shortfall relative to projection of CD growth in addition

to the weakness of M1.

1/ Money supply figures have been revised on the basis of the April call
report. Benchmarking to this call lowers the April level of the money
stock by $1.4 billion, and this benchmark adjustment reduces levels in
subsequent months byroughly corresponding amounts. Smaller downward
adjustments were made back through January. Comparisons of rates of
growth for the old and revised series are shown in Appendix Table VI.
Growth of M1 in the first half of 1974 has been lowered to a 6 per cent
annual rate by the revised series, as compared with 7.1 per cent on the
old series.

(2) Savings flows to nonbank thrift institutions in July were

quite weak. On a seasonally adjusted basis.mutual savings banks experienced

a net deposit outflow, while deposit growth at S&L's was small. Data so

far available for August suggest a continuance of the relatively weak

performance at non-bank thrift institutions, no doubt reflecting the

bunching of security offerings attractive to small investors. These

other alternatives have included variable rate securities issued by bank

holding companies and other corporations designed to appeal to individuals,

and new high coupon Treasury issues offered in the mid-August refunding.

(3) The Federal funds market has eased appreciably since the

last FOMC meeting. In the past two weeks, funds have been trading at rates

within a 12 to 12¼ per cent range, about 100 basis points below the average

established during the week of the July FOMC meeting and about 150 basis

points under the peak level reached in the first week of July. There has

apparently been some lessening in banks' reluctance to borrow at the Federal

Reserve since the late June - early July period of peak money market tensions.

Member bank borrowing (exclusive of emergency borrowing) has been about $200

million higher on average in the past four statement weeks as compared with

the previous four. From mid-July to mid-August total borrowing averaged

$3.3 billion, of which $1.5 billion represented emergency borrowing (almost

all of which was at Franklin National).

(4) Private short-term interest rates have moved down concurrently

with the Federal funds rate, though by smaller amounts. Key rates, such as

those on 90-day commercial paper and bank CD's are now about ¼ to ½ of a

percentage point below their levels at the time of the July meeting. Yields



-3-

on new corporate and municipal bonds have also edged lower over this period.

New issues have been distributed more readily, partly because the sizes of some

issues have been scaled down and the maturities shortened.

(5) In contrast to private rates, yields on Treasury and Federal

agency securities have risen significantly during the intermeeting period.

Yields on Treasury coupon issues have risen about 20 to 30 basis points

and bill rates--which had been depressed relative to the general level of

market rates--have advanced about one percentage point. A series of

Treasury financing operations which added significantly to the floating

supply of issues, together with anticipation of further bill financing,

were mainly responsible for the upward pressure on rates. Market

disappointment over the failure of Arab countries to invest their oil

revenues in Treasury special issues has also added to the upward pressure.

(6) The three new coupon issues offered in the Treasury's mid-

August refunding have been well received. In view of their high coupon

rates, the issues were particularly attractive to individual investors.

As a result, half of the amount auctioned was awarded to noncompetitive

bidders, a record participation for this type of bidding. All three

new issues are currently trading at modest premiums above their average

auction prices. Dealers have not pressed their awards on the market

and still hold nearly three-fourths of the $1,050 million they were

originally awarded.

(7) The table on page 5 shOws (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various



-4-

recent time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates

computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-

of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in

appendix table IV for the three alternatives presented in the next

section.

the table on p.6a).

(9) Alternative B continues the 5¼ per cent annual growth rate

for M1 over the second half of 1974 adopted by the Committee at its last

meeting. Because of the downward revision in the level of the

money stock as a result of benchmarking to the April call report,

this 5¼ per cent rate of growth would lead to a level of M1 by the

end of this year that is $1.4 billion lower than that implicit in

the growth path adopted at the last meeting. Alternative A encompasses

a more rapid 6¼ per cent rate of growth for M1 over the July-December

period, while Alternative C comprises specifications that might

be considered if the Committee wishes to aim for a lower rate of growth

than previously desired for the monetary aggregates over the second half

of the year. (The three alternatives are depicted in the chart on the

following page).

(10) Under alternative B, and given the recent slowing in

money growth, the staff expects that the Federal funds rate may decline

a little further between now and the next meeting--centering around

11 per cent. Such a decline would not in itself be sufficient to lead

to more than a quite modest downward adjustment in other market rates.

Demand pressures on credit markets are expected to be fairly well

sustained in the weeks ahead, as a sizable volume of corporate, municipal,

and Federal agency offerings come to market. The Treasury will probably

borrow another $2 billion or so of cash in early September, possibly

through tax bills, over and above ongoing additions to the weekly bill

auctions. While this flow of new securities would work to limit down-

ward rate adjustments, a sizable expectational decline in rates could

take place if a further downdrift in the funds rate were accompanied by

continued slow growth in the monetary aggregates and adverse business news.

(11) Alternative A contemplates a significant further decline

in the funds rate over the next few weeks, which would undoubtedly spur

a sharp drop of interest rates generally. Alternative C, on the other

hand, envisions a return of the Federal funds rate to the 13 per cent

area, and this would be accompanied by a re-emergence of market tensions

and generally rising interest rates. Dealers in U.S. Government securities

would, under the circumstances, attempt to liquidate positions enlarged

in the wake of recent Treasury financings.

(12) Under the Federal funds rates contemplated in any of the

alternatives, the unusually low growth rate of M1 in July would not be

expected to persist in the months ahead, assuming the staff projections

of nominal GNP growth are correct. Taking account of the strengthening

indicated by fragmentary early-August data, M1 would be expected to grow

in a 4¾-6¾ per cent range in the August-September period under alternative B.

(13) Expansion in time deposits other than money market CD's

at banks is expected to slow a little further over the months ahead under

alternative B. While the Federal funds rate and other short-term rates

may decline somewhat, the increased availability of instruments attractive

to small savers (such as variable-rate debentures, money market mutual funds,

and Treasury and Federal agency issues) is likely to lead to continued

substitution of such instruments for Regulation Q-constrained time and

savings accounts. Growth in savings accounts at nonbank thrift institutions

is expected to remain quite weak under alternative B, thus continuing sub-

stantial constraint on the supply of private mortgage funds. Growth in

consumer-type time and savings at both banks and nonbank thrift institutions

would be even more constrained under alternative C, whereas growth in

such savings would begin to recover under alternative A.

(14) Business loan growth at banks is likely to be less strong

over the next few months than it was during the first seven months of

the year, partly in reflection of a projected low rate of inventory

accumulation and partly as a result of tight bank lending policies. Growth

in money market CD's also is expected to be at a more moderate pace in the

months ahead. In these circumstances, bank credit growth is also expected

to slow over the latter half of the year.



-9-

(15) Demands for bank credit could be enlarged, however, should

investors become more selective and should liquidity pressure become more

pervasive. Under such circumstances, many borrowers, particularly those

of less-than-prime quality, would be forced to fall back on bank lines.

While borrowers' ability to float debt in the open market has improved

since early July, yield spreads reflecting risk differentials generally

remain wider than normal. Thus, markets and investor attitudes continue

to be quite sensitive to shocks to confidence that might be generated

by such factors as failures, or near-failures, of financial institutions

or business firms.



-10-

Proposed directive

(16) Presented below ate three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed

in the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed

to delete the reference to Treasury financing because the quarterly

refunding announced on July 31 has been completed.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of {DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury refunding and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: that would

moderate] CONSISTENT WITH SOMEWHAT FASTER growth in monetary

aggregates [DEL: over the months ahead] THAN HAS PREVAILED OVER RECENT

MONTHS.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury refunding and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: that would]

CONSISTENT WITH moderate growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead.



-11-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury refunding and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: that would

moderate] CONSISTENT WITH RELATIVELY SLOW growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.

(17) In the event the Committee wishes to couch the

operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market

conditions, the specifications of alternative B might be associated

with language indicating that "...the Committee seeks to maintain money

market conditions in the neighborhood of the restrictive conditions

recently prevailing, provided that the monetary aggregates appear to

be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance."

Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agree-
mehts maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt

issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal

funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
