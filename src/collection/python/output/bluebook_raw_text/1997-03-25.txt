Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Class I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the February FOMC meeting, federal funds have traded near the intended

rate of 5-1/4 percent, though unexpectedly low demands for excess reserves at times have

pulled the rate below this level. Other interest rates drifted down on balance over the first

part of the intermeeting period (chart), as incoming data showed inflation damped and seemed

to confirm widely held expectations that the economy would slow in the first quarter. Rates

backed up subsequently, however, partly in response to the Chairman's Congressional

testimonies, which were read as suggesting both somewhat greater concern about the potential

for building inflationary pressures than the market had perceived and a greater willingness by

the Federal Reserve to tighten in order to head them off. In recent weeks, evidence that

spending and output growth remained strong and that any slowing of the economic expansion

in the first quarter was likely to be much less marked than had been anticipated added to

upward pressure on interest rates, as perhaps did the perception that prospects for an

agreement to balance the budget were diminishing.

(2) On net, short-term rates rose 20 to 30 basis points over the intermeeting period

and, judging from federal funds futures quotes, markets recently have come to assign high

odds on a quarter-point tightening in March. Intermediate- and longer-term Treasury rates

rose 25 to 40 basis points. The Treasury's inflation-indexed bond increased about half as

much; however, limited trading activity in this bond counsels against a fine reading of

changes in the spread of the nominal over real rates, which incorporates compensation for

both expected inflation and inflation uncertainty. Survey data on inflation expectations have

shown little change of late. Most indexes of equity prices declined slightly over the period,

but weakness in technology and small capitalization stocks sent the NASDAQ down sharply.

(3) With growth prospects in the U.S. boosted relative to those abroad, reflected in

greater increases in interest rates in the U.S. than abroad, the dollar's weighted-average

exchange value rose 2-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated only

slightly against the yen, which was supported by a growing realization that Japan's trade and

current account surpluses are burgeoning, that these surpluses are not sustainable, and that the

yen most likely will eventually appreciate in response.

(4) Broad money growth remained fairly strong in February, though data for early

March suggest some moderation. M2 expanded at a 5 percent rate last month, the same as in

January, no doubt supported in both months by robust income growth.1 Based on the staff's

GDP forecast, M2 velocity is expected to rise only a little in the first quarter. With

opportunity costs about unchanged, this behavior of velocity would extend the relatively

stable relationship between these two measures that has prevailed for the last 2-1/2 years. M3

growth continued to outpace that of M2, reflecting sizable issuance of large time deposits,

particularly by foreign banks, which have been using them to fund rapid asset expansion as

1M1 grew at a 3/4 percent annual rate in February; adjusted for the initial effects of
sweeps, growth was at a 7-3/4 percent rate. The monetary base grew at a 6 percent rate last
month, and at a 7-1/2 percent rate adjusted for the effect of sweeps.

well as to pay down borrowing from their foreign offices. M3 also continued to be boosted

by further strong growth of money funds, which have continued to gain popularity as a

business cash management vehicle in recent years.

(5) Growth of nonfinancial sector debt appears to have slowed a bit in the early

months of the year, owing to some running down of cash balances of the federal and state

government sectors. Private debt, by contrast, looks to be expanding at a little above its

fourth-quarter pace. A greater flow of credit to the nonfinancial business sector reflects

merger and acquisition activity and capital outlays. As bond yields backed up, the

composition of business borrowing shifted a little in the direction of short-term sources of

funds. Reflecting the strength of business balance sheets, credit supply conditions remain

quite favorable. Junk bond spreads have narrowed; spreads on other open market instruments

have held steady at very low levels; spreads of large bank loan rates over base rates ticked up

in the first quarter, but they remain in the low portion of the historical range. Problems in

the "sub-prime" auto loan market, which have included instances of defaulted commercial

paper and bankruptcy, have had little effect on either the commercial paper market generally

or the availability of credit to the household sector overall. However, losses on credit cards

continued to mount, and a major credit card lender recently reported an earnings loss owing

to unexpected deterioration in loan quality. It remains to be seen whether this experience will

prompt a more cautious approach over a wider spectrum of borrowers and lenders. The

quality of other consumer debt also continued to erode through the end of last year, but by

much less, and delinquencies on home mortgages moved up from very low levels. Household

sector debt growth appears to have strengthened somewhat so far this year, with faster growth

evident in both its consumer credit and mortgage components.

Policy Alternatives

(6) The current pace of economic activity appears considerably more robust than

had been expected in the January Greenbook. Persistent strength in domestic demand has

prompted the staff to raise appreciably its projections of nominal and real GDP growth for

1997; the staff projections had been in line with the central tendencies of FOMC member

forecasts in the latest Humphrey-Hawkins report, but are now about a half percentage point

above the upper ends of the central tendency ranges. With growth in real GDP projected by

the staff to exceed its estimate of the growth in potential by nearly a percentage point this

year, employment and economic activity would over time move further above levels thought

to be associated with stable inflation. The increased inflation pressures are unlikely to show

through right away; indeed, the staff still forecasts CPI inflation to be below the FOMC

members' central tendency in 1997, held down by the rise in the dollar and favorable

developments in food and energy markets. However, inflation picks up noticeably in 1998

and presumably beyond.

(7) Nonetheless, a number of considerations regarding the outlook might induce the

Committee to forgo tightening at the March meeting, as under alternative B. The fact that

resource utilization rates have been close to current levels for several quarters, with no sign

that the underlying trend of price inflation is moving higher, might suggest that the economy

may not in fact have overshot its long-run potential. In light of this possibility, the

Committee may want to wait to see more definite indications that price pressures are likely to

intensify before tightening--for example, additional increases in resource utilization or in wage

inflation. Moreover, even if a tightening is needed, the Committee may perceive no urgency,

especially in light of the projected decline in total CPI inflation this year, which, in turn,



-7-

would help restrain inflation expectations. Were the Committee to wait to see if the

unemployment rate declines, or if temporary factors damping compensation growth like health

care savings or worker insecurity diminish, sufficient lead time may still be available to

prevent tight labor markets from being translated into a materially higher rate of general price

inflation. Even should the upturn in wage inflation already observed be sustained or become

steeper, it still could be largely absorbed for a time in reduced profit margins or matched by

faster productivity growth, rather than passed through quickly to prices. Finally, the

enthusiasm of international investors for the dollar may prove more lasting than anticipated by

the staff, restraining inflation pressures in 1998 and beyond relative to the staff forecast.

(8) With market participants apparently placing high odds on a 25 basis point

tightening in the federal funds rate at the March meeting, interest rates probably would fall

somewhat if the unchanged policy of alternative B were adopted. Nonetheless, many

observers would likely continue to view tightening as inevitable, unless economic growth

slows to an unexpected degree, and these expectations would limit the decline in long-term

rates and any softening in the dollar. Indeed, if data in the weeks ahead come in as the staff

projects -- strong real GDP growth and the unemployment rate declining -- both short- and

long-term interest rates would back up, with long-term rates possibly more than reversing any

initial rally.

(9) The Committee might choose to increase the federal funds rate, perhaps by the

50 basis points of alternative C, in order to lean against the likely buildup of inflation

pressures. Recent strength in aggregate demand suggests that interest rates are not high

enough to restrain economic growth over the near term to the likely rate of increase in

potential, so resource use probably will be moving more decidedly above sustainable levels.



-8-

The alternative simulations in the Greenbook imply that substantial tightening is needed over

the balance of the year to forestall a lasting increase in the rate of inflation. Because of lags

in the effects of policy, delaying the tightening process for long in these circumstances would

increase the amount that the real funds rate eventually would have to be raised to reverse the

impetus imparted to the inflation process, amplifying the associated swing in real GDP. Even

if the Committee is not as pessimistic as the staff on the inflation outlook, some firming may

still be warranted to improve the balance of risks facing the economy. Robust final demand

and lean inventories would suggest that the likelihood of significant economic weakness is

small at present and that the economy should retain significant forward momentum even after

a tightening. With demand strong, only unusual, persistent increases in productivity or in

labor force participation would avert added cost and price pressures at some point in the

future if the current funds rate is maintained. Given these current risks, a tightening action

might seem especially appropriate if the Committee sought to improve the prospects for

progress over the next few years toward its long-run price stability objective.

(10) In light of recent data on economic activity and the mention of the possibility

of preemptive action in the Chairman's testimonies, a slight tightening would surprise market

participants very little. Nevertheless, a 50 basis point move at this meeting is larger than

market analysts expect, judging partly by what is built into the yield curve; it would likely

prompt a substantial decline in bond and equity prices and a further strengthening of the

dollar in foreign exchange markets. The extent of the response in financial markets would, of

course, depend on whether the policy move were seen as the first of a series or as a one-time

adjustment. On the one hand, a 50 basis point change might be read as indicating that the

Federal Reserve was more concerned about inflation prospects than most had thought, adding



-9-

to the upward pressure on rates. On the other, markets might assume that, with a move of

this size, policy would be on hold for a while, reducing uncertainties about whether further

actions were imminent. Indeed, recent FOMC minutes and Committee members' speeches

and testimonies have generally emphasized the Committee's perception that any

disequilibrium is small, and markets could see the 50 basis point adjustment as putting policy

at a setting that would re-equilibrate risks for some time.

(11) If the Committee felt that a tightening were needed but believed that a modest

firming might be sufficient to contain inflation, it could choose to raise the federal funds rate

25 rather than 50 basis points. Even if a larger increase were seen as ultimately necessary, a

smaller initial move might seem desirable if it were viewed as less likely to trigger an

outsized reaction in financial markets. Since high odds on a 25 basis point tightening are

already embodied in market yields, both long- and short-term rates might rise relatively little

on the announcement of such an action. However, market responses over time would likely

be muted only if market participants took the modest firming to augur less cumulative

tightening than an immediate 50 basis point move. Based on the pattern of prior Committee

actions, markets could soon begin to build in at least one more 25 basis point firming, a

tendency that would be amplified if incoming data are as strong as in the staff forecast.

(12) Under alternative B and the staff forecast, debt is expected to continue to grow

around its recent pace in the months ahead, while money growth tends to moderate as the

expansion of nominal GDP slows. The debt of nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at a

5 percent rate from February to June, paced by the business and household sectors. Business

borrowing picks up somewhat, as capital spending remains strong, while flows of internal

funds level out. For households, although credit is likely to become somewhat harder to



-10-

obtain for marginal borrowers, overall consumer debt should remain on its recent moderate

growth path.

(13) M2 growth from February to June under alternative B is projected to slow to a

4-1/2 percent rate, reflecting the deceleration in nominal GDP. By midyear, this aggregate

will likely be near the upper edge of its 1-to-5 percent annual range. Expansion of M3

should ease relative to its unusually rapid pace of earlier this year, as the torrid growth in

money funds slows to a more sustainable rate and depositories resume a more typical balance

of financing between deposits and non-deposit funding sources. From February to June, M3

is projected to increase at a 6 percent rate, leaving it well above the upper end of its annual

range.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes the

usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee

seeks to DECREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT)/maintain/INCREASE

(SLIGHTLY/ SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price

stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to

economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser

reserve restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some

moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.
