0,1993-05-18,1993-05-19,Financial Times,D-MARK HIT BY EASING OF TENSIONS IN ERM.,"The prospect of a Yes vote in the Danish referendum weakened the D-Mark yesterday, as international investors took the view that such a result would significantly ease tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. Several European currencies, including sterling and the Italian lira, enjoyed strong rises against the D-Mark, as Danish opinion polls pointed to a clear ratification of the Maastricht treaty and a period of calm in Europe's fixed exchange rate system. This reversed a trend of recent weeks in which investors, fearful of another Danish No, sought a safe haven against currency turmoil and a renewed threat to European economic and monetary union by buying D-Marks and Swiss francs. German government bond prices also fell to the benefit of Italian and French bonds. Danish opinion polls helped the pound to close a pfennig higher against the D-Mark on the day, at DM 2.4875. The Italian lira was also a strong performer, closing at L909.2 against the D-Mark from a previous close of L914.9. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig to peak at DM 1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a 7-week high. It later closed in London at DM 1.6240. An additional factor pushing the dollar higher against the German currency was speculation that the Federal Reserve's federal open market committee would lean towards tightening monetary policy at its meeting in New York yesterday. Expectations of a rise in short-term US interest rates have followed last week's US inflation figures, which were higher than anticipated. The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be known for some weeks. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1993. "
1,1993-05-18,1993-05-19,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - SIZE AND COUPON OF NEXT GILT AUCTION WELL RECEIVED.,"THE BANK of England's announcement that the next gilt auction would be of #3bn 7 3/4% stock due 2006 lifted the UK government bond market at the end of the day. The good reception was attributed to the size of the auction - at the bottom end of expectations - and to the comparatively low coupon. A coupon below 8% was taken as a sign of the bank's confidence in a lower inflation outlook. It also meant the gilt would be priced below par, building in a capital gain. The futures contract benefited most, gaining about 3/8 points. In the cash market the auction area and beyond showed small gains. DISAPPOINTMENT that the Bundesbank left the repo rate unchanged at 7.60% caused a sell-off in the German government bond market. The immobility cast a further pall over hopes that it would cut the Lombard or discount rates at its council meeting today, although a few were still looking for a 1/4 reduction. Once the June futures contract fell through 94.45, further sales were triggered. The day's low was 94.26, from which there was some recovery. Expectations of a Yes vote in Denmark also acted as a drag on bunds, which are seen as losing more of their safe haven status. A Yes vote would give another push to the convergence story, activating further switches to higher yielders. The yield spread of 10-year Danish government bonds over bunds would be expected to narrow significantly from yesterday's 71 basis points. French government bonds have continued to benefit from this theme, with the bund-OAT yield spread coming in to as little as 29 basis points. THE ITALIAN government bond market, already attracting demand as a high yielder, rose further on the news that withholding tax would be refunded much more quickly to overseas investors. The 12 1/2% tax, which has taken six months to reclaim, has proved a deterrent to overseas investors. A new target of only two to three weeks was announced by the government, which needs overseas investors to finance the public sector deficit. It also announced spending cuts designed to counteract a looming overshoot on that deficit. The BTP future gained 80 basis points to close near its all time high of 99.56. THE JAPANESE government bond market took fright at a newspaper report that short-term interest rates might rise, exacerbating its concerns about economic recovery. The September futures contract fell through a key support level, opening at 106.44 and closing at 106.11. In the cash market the yield on the benchmark No 145 rose from 4.575% to 4.67%. Once again there was a lack of domestic demand. Other niggling factors were a rise in the overnight money rate to 3 7/32%, the weakening of the yen against the dollar and declines in overseas government bond markets. The US Treasury yield curve continued to flatten yesterday as longer-dated securities posted fresh declines while the short end held its ground. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down at 101 9/32, yielding 7.018%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99, to yield 4.026%. The day's only economic news - a 6.7% rise in monthly housing starts - was largely ignored but prices at the long end eased because attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting in Washington DC. Recent news on inflation has heightened speculation that the FOMC might decide to shift the bias of monetary policy towards a possibly tightening. Although such a move would not necessarily involve a hike in interest rates, it would make it more likely that interest rates would go up, rather than stay steady or be lowered, over the coming months.

2,1993-05-18,1993-05-19,Financial Times,FOREIGN EXCHANGES - DM WEAKER AS DANES VOTE.,"BOTH the D-Mark and the Swiss franc continued to weaken in European trading yesterday as dealers took the view that there would be a strong Yes vote in Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, writes James Blitz. The first exit polls following the referendum indicated last night that there had been a comfortable victory for the Yes camp, although final confirmation of the result was being awaited. Nevertheless, the exit polls were clearly in line with the market's expectations and suggested that tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism were about to ease. As on previous days, the expectation that the treaty would be ratified led to unwinding of positions in both the D-Mark and the Swiss franc, both of which have been viewed as safe haven currencies in the event of a No vote. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig to peak at DM 1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a seven-week high. It closed in London at DM 1.6240, and later ended New York trading at DM 1.6246. Again, a factor pushing the dollar up against the German currency was speculation that the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee would lean towards tightening monetary policy following last week's higher than expected figures for US inflation. The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be known for some weeks. In Europe, expectations of a Yes vote led dealers to go long of several currencies outside the D-Mark bloc and to short the Swiss franc, which closed at SwFr 0.910 to the D-Mark from a previous SwFr 0.909. The Italian lira was the best performer on the Continent, ending at L909.2 per D-Mark from a previous L914.9. The lira's rise partly reflected strong buying of Italian bonds, with the five-year BTP future moving up more than 40 basis points on the day. Sterling also enjoyed a strong performance, again driven by the same factors. It finished at DM 2.4875, a full pfennig higher on the day. The clearest sign that the market was expecting a Yes vote was, of course, the Danish krone's performance. Denmark's currency peaked at DKr3.8250 to the D-Mark, and then weakened on profit-taking to end at around DKr3.8425. Its divergence indicator against its Ecu central rate fell to around minus 37 basis points at the close of London trading, some 3 basis points higher than at Monday's close. An important question facing the market today is whether the D-Mark's performance has been sufficiently bad in recent days to make the Bundesbank think twice about cutting the discount rate at its council meeting today. A 25 basis-point easing in the discount rate has been anticipated, but several Bundesbank officials have recently expressed concern about the dangers of imported inflation.

4,2001-03-20,2001-03-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),Bolognese rules OK.,"Twenty-four hours is a long time in the life of Romano Prodi. On Tuesday, the president of the European Commission went on Swedish TV and criticised the Swedish presidency of the EU for lacking any ambition. Yesterday he used a Brussels briefing, ahead of this week's EU Stockholm summit, to offer a mea culpa. Far from intending to criticise the Swedish presidency for being unambitious, Prodi pleaded that once again he may not have expressed himself clearly. Having salved his conscience he then outlined a bewildering wish list of what the Commission would like to see happen in Stockholm. Among the items he listed was the Spanish-British impasse over Gibraltar airport, which threatens to bring the Commission's air traffic control programme to a halt. So keen is Prodi to get the issue solved that he's been searching for answers in his Latin version of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht - which handed Gibraltar over to Britain. Prodi then raised the thorny issue of which languages should be used for some EU bureaucracy. He suggested English, French and German - but joked that if his proposal were rejected he would impose his native Bolognese dialect. In reverse? When Noel Goutard, the veteran chairman of Valeo, named Andre Navarri as his successor in June 1999, he described the former Alsthom executive as ""un garcon superbe"". Less than a year after Navarri replaced Goutard at the helm of the auto components group, he was shown the door on Wednesday. Apparently, the Valeo board was unimpressed by Navarri's long-term strategy for reviving the company. It was more interested in short-term restructuring action and plans to improve shareholder returns. Observer understands that one of those calling for his head was Ernest Antoine Seilliere, chairman of MEDEF, the French employers' association. Seilliere's CGIP investment company is the largest shareholder in Valeo, with 20.6 per cent of the shares, almost 30 per cent of the votes and four representatives on the Valeo board. It's thought that CGIP wanted to see a better return from Valeo. So exit Navarri and re-enter Goutard, who will chair a new supervisory board. Insiders insist Goutard will not be running the company but advising on strategy. For a company that claims to be a leader in clutches and transmissions, this reads a little like engaging reverse gear. Miracle man? Spare a thought for Ricardo Lopez Murphy. The respected economist was called into service to right the troubled Argentine economy but was chewed up and spat out by the voracious Argentine political system in just 15 days. Still, Lopez Murphyshould take heart - hehas lasted longer thanmany others in his position. Joaqun de Las Heras took the post during the military coup in 1976 but survived just six days in office before he was replaced. Jorge Wehbe was appointed to the ill-fated post in 1962, only to find that the president who had chosen him was overthrown by the army. He was 12 days in office. Finally, Lopez Murphy should take comfort in the fact that he left the post with his health intact. Miguel Angel Roig, who was appointed to the economy ministry by the last president, Carlos Menem, died of a heart attack after just seven days in the office. In fact, Argentina's longest-serving economy minister is the one who has just returned: Domingo Cavallo. He served for an unprecedented five years under Carlos Menem and yesterday appeared very much in his element, threatening congressmen and chastising journalists. Close collaborators described his mood as ""euphoric"". Forget about whether he's the best man for the job; it's quite possible that he's the only man. Travel light Pity Kim Woo-choong, the fugitive founder of the bankrupt Daewoo group. The author of the business guide Every Street is Paved with Gold has been reduced to staying in third-class hotels in Europe and surviving on hamburgers. His only possessions are several pairs of underpants, while he depends on the charity of friends for living expenses. That at least is the picture portrayed by Kim's lawyer to rebut suggestions that the businessman is living the high life as Interpol mounts a search to arrest him for an alleged $20bn accountancy fraud - the world's biggest. But the tale of woe, which brought down the Daewoo group in 1999, doesn't end there. Kim, 65, is suffering from suspected stomach cancer and is receiving treatment for hardening of the arteries. ""He's on the run not to avoid punishment but to put order into his life by writing his memoirs,"" says his lawyer. The lawyer adds that Kim may yet return home to clear his name. Cohen's poem The strain of trying to prop up the US stock market has clearly taken its toll on Abby Joseph Cohen, the US strategist and patron saint of the 1990s bull run. She has turned to poetry. Her latest note, ""Alan at the Bat"", is apparently a pastiche of a poem by Ernest L. Thayer, although it reads more like McGonagall than Marlowe. ""The outlook wasn't brilliant for the FOMC that day/The economy was weaker with less energy to play/And when the Nasdaq fell and the S&P did the same/A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.""

5,2001-03-20,2001-03-21,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - US investors thumb their noses at Fed's declaration of independence FED FUNDS RATE CUT TO 5%.,"Has the Federal Reserve declared its independence from the US stock market? One of the interesting sidebars to the drama over whether the US will stumble into a full-blown recession this year has been a cat-and-mouse game under way between the Federal Reserve and US equity markets. Every downward lurch in stock prices this year inflamed expectations of big rate cuts, as the Fed embarked on the biggest, fastest wave of monetary easing in any three-month period since 1982. The Fed's policy-making open market committee voted yesterday to cut short-term interest rates by a widely expected half-point, driving the Fed funds rate to a 20-month low of 5 per cent and almost completely erasing the rate increases that followed the 1997-98 global financial crisis. But many investors clearly hoped for more, thumbed their noses at the decision and went back to their regularly scheduled asset selling. The battered, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index erased its gains for the day and sank more than 3 per cent within an hour of the Fed's decision. Other stock indices followed suit. While the Fed, in a statement following the decision, acknowledged faltering investment and spending, subsequent inventory build-ups and excess capacity that could keep production ""soft"" for some time, it shied away from giving investors the ""surprise"" they expected. A re-reading of Alan Greenspan's repeated and vehement denials of any direct connection between stock prices and monetary policymaking might have tempered such expectations. The period September to November 1998 was the last time the Fed aggressively slashed interest rates. Equity prices were plunging at the time. But Mr Greenspan later explained that the Fed acted in its widely accepted role as lender of last resort to pre-empt a panic and a ""seizing up"" of debt markets following Russia's debt default and a feared implosion of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. In testimony to congressional lawmakers in December 1998, the Fed chairman acknowledged that ""equity prices can play an important role in the economy, which the central bank must take into account"", but he insisted that the Fed was not attempting ""to prop up equity prices, nor did we plan to continue to ease rates until equity prices recovered, as some have erroneously inferred. This has not been, and is not now, our policy or intent."" With a liquidity crisis much less apparent now than in 1998, the Fed faced the possibility of reviving faith in a ""Greenspan put"", if only by default. It appeared mindful of that, said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston in New York. ""The Fed basically signalled that it's going to key its future rate cuts to the economy, not to the stock market,"" he said. ""The only way the market can influence the Fed is indirectly, through what it does to spending, and spending has held up better than expected."" While economic conditions in the US have deteriorated, the unemployment rate has held remarkably steady and retail sales have not collapsed. It is even possible that the US economy has recovered and more rate cuts could exacerbate any imbalances in the economy. ""There's an ambiguity in the data that precludes (the Fed) from being more aggressive at this time,"" said John Lipsky, the chief economist at JP Morgan Chase. But the Fed statement used wording that presaged surprise inter-meeting cuts in the past. It said it would ""monitor developments closely"" and reaffirmed its view that risks remained tilted toward more ""economic weakness in the foreseeable future"". Financial markets appeared to take that promise seriously. After the statement's release, futures prices quickly registered expectations for the Fed funds rate to drop as much as 75 basis points to 4.25 per cent by mid-year. Full statement from the FOMC The following is the full text of the Federal Open Market Committee statement. ""The committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 per cent. In a related action the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 4 1/2 per cent. ""Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears well under way. ""Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. ""In these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, the Fed will need to monitor developments closely. ""The committee continues to believe, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. In taking the discount rate action, the Fed approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of all 12 reserve banks."" "
6,2001-03-20,2001-03-21,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar up as Fed cuts rates by 50bp.,"The dollar initially spiked higher after the decision of the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points, as equity markets gave a warm response to the move. ""The key to the rise in the dollar has been the good performance of equity markets,"" said Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast. The US currency had been trading around half a cent lower against the euro ahead of the decison. Many said that the impact of the shift in monetary policy on the dollar would only become clear over the next few trading sessions. The reaction of the equity markets is thought to be key. Until last week the dollar was thought to be vulnerable to falling equity markets. With share ownership higher in the US than Europe or Japan, sliding stocks are expected to take a bigger bite out of US consumer spending and therefore economic growth. But at the end of last week the dollar was seen to benefit from safe-haven flows into the bond market as investors fled falling stock markets. Trading ahead of the FOMC decision was subdued. With Japanese traders on holiday, trading in the yen was especially thin. The yen settled into a narrow range after the volatility following Monday's monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. By the end of London trading the dollar stood at Y122.6, compared to Y122.2. * Argentina provided an element of drama to an otherwise subdued pre-Fed markets yesterday, with the resignation of the economics minister again unsettling the markets. The departure of Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, following his failure to secure agreement on a $4.45bn two-year cost cutting plan, caused some to worry over the long-term viability of Argentina's currency board. The peg with the dollar has been been inflicting ever greater pain on the Argentine economy. ""Argentina has been suffering from a classic gold standard problem,"" said Peter von Maydell, senior currency economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Earlier in the week the dollar, and hence the Argentine peso, hit a record high against the Brazilian real. This has undermined the competitiveness of the Argentine economy - which conducts around 30 per cent of its trade with Brazil - and sent unemployment to 14.5 per cent. Aside from devaluation, deflation has been the only way to regain competitiveness. But so far the situation in Argentina has failed to spill over into other emerging markets. This is partly because most expect the currency peg to survive. The appointment of Domingo Cavallo as finance minister did something to ease nervousness. Mr Cavallo, who introduced the fixed exchange system in 1991, is thought by many to be more likely to secure political approval for budget cuts than his predecessor. Implied one-month yields in the non-deliverable forwards market - seen as a gauge of the prospect of a peso devaluation - have fallen steeply since Friday. ""Things have calmed down but Argentina is still in some kind of crisis mode,"" said David Lubin, emerging markets economist at HSBC in London. But he added that convertibility was a tough nut to crack. ""It would be possible to see the currency board surviving even a debt default."" Mr von Maydell said that Argentina's economic problems had not yet become unsustainable. ""Although unemployment is rising, it is still some distance from the 18.4 per cent it touched back in May 1995,"" he said. * Atriax, the foreign exchange internet portal, has said it plans to expand into bond and derivative markets. Dan Morehead, the chief executive of Atriax, said clients would prefer an internet platform which would allow them to trade a range of assets. The portal, which plans to go live between April and June, was formed last October by Deutsche Bank, Chase, Citibank and Reuters. "
7,1990-07-03,1990-07-04,Financial Times,US Manufacturing Maintains Flat Trend.,"New orders for US manufactured goods rose 2.1 per cent in May, reversing a similar decline the previous month and maintaining what the Commerce Department sees as a relatively flat trend. Following Monday's increase in the purchasing managers' index of manufacturing activity, yesterday's figures reinforce the picture of, at best, sluggish growth in the US economy. Manufacturing output appears to be rising slowly, notably for export as domestic consumption has slipped back in recent months. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee (FOMC) yesterday finished a regular two-day review of its monetary approach. The market generally expects no change in the immediate future although short-term interest rates could fall later in the summer, especially if there is agreement between the Bush Administration and Congress on a 'credible multi-year package' to reduce the federal budget deficit. Yesterday's figures, in seasonally adjusted current dollars, show that shipments of manufactured goods increased 2 per cent in May, more than offsetting the previous 1.3 per cent decline. Manufacturing inventories were flat, continuing the recent trend and suggesting there is no large overhang of stocks which might force producers to cut their production levels.

8,1990-07-03,1990-07-04,Financial Times,US manufacturing maintains flat trend,"NEW orders for US manufactured goods rose 2.1 per cent in May, reversing a similar decline the previous month and maintaining what the Commerce Department sees as a relatively flat trend. Following Monday's increase in the purchasing managers' index of manufacturing activity, yesterday's figures reinforce the picture of, at best, sluggish growth in the US economy.

Some economists are concerned that the slowdown will turn into a recession, but recent comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and by most other Fed governors and regional bank presidents on the FOMC have been less pessimistic. Regional bank presidents remain worried about inflationary pressures and believe it would be wrong to ease policy prematurely. The Administration, while believing a recession can be avoided, argues that the Fed is too concerned with inflation, which the Treasury maintains has stabilised. Yesterday's figures, in seasonally adjusted current dollars, show that shipments of manufactured goods increased 2 per cent in May, more than offsetting the previous 1.3 per cent decline. Manufacturing inventories were flat, continuing the recent trend and suggesting there is no large overhang of stocks which might force producers to cut their production levels. "
9,1997-08-19,1997-08-20,Financial Times,D-Mark falls as rate threats fade.,"The D-Mark fell on fresh signs that the Bundesbank would not raise interest rates soon. The bank set its repo tender unchanged at a fixed rate of 3.00% for another week, and reported that growth in M3 money supply was far slower than forecast. M3 grew at a rate of 5.7% for the year to July. The Bundesbank thinks M3 growth is a good indicator of future inflation. Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that there was little need for Germany to raise rates to defend the D-Mark. The dollar's surge of the past year had created ""no inflationary effects"" in Europe, and had helped the European Union, he said. The dollar, helped by a recovery in US stocks after last week's carnage, gained 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.836. It rose Y 0.5 against the yen to Y 118.2, as gloom over the Japanese economy reduced prospects of an interest rate rise this year. Trading was again thin because of summer holidays. The Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting late yesterday also cast a shadow. However, as expected, the FOMC left US interest rates unchanged. The dollar was held back by strong resistance around DM 1.84 to the D-Mark, and by fears that the Bundesbank might try to revive prospects of a rate rise tomorrow, when its council meets for the first time after a four-week summer break. The Bundesbank has repeatedly threatened to move from a fixed to a variable rate repo tender, which could cause rates to creep higher. Euromark futures contracts moved little yesterday and are still pricing in a 25-basis-point German rate rise by September. Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the Bundesbank's apparent tactic of ""leaving an air of uncertainty over the market"" had been as effective as a rate rise at stopping the dollar's ascent. The pound rose 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.950, but fell half a cent against the dollar to $1.606. * The Canadian dollar fell on figures showing that the country's core consumer price index rose just 1.5% in the year to July. That reduced prospects of an interest rate rise. The Canadian dollar fell 0.4 cents against the US dollar to C$1.393, even though the Bank of Canada was seen buying its currency in the market. * The Australian dollar recovered in London trading yesterday from a tumble prompted by a false wire report. The wire quoted the Reserve Bank of Australia as saying that interest rates could be cut again. But the bank's quarterly report on the economy and financial markets had said nothing of the sort. It had merely given a rationale for previous cuts. The wire report had sent the Aussie dollar down to $0.7375, from its Monday close of $0.7423/28. But in trading after the London close yesterday the Aussie dollar was back up at $0.7415/25. The bank's report said the key inflation rate would stay below 2% possibly into 1998. But it also said that current interest rate levels could accommodate stronger growth. This suggested there was little need for another rate cut. Australia's key cash rate has fallen to 5%, below US rate levels. * The Hong Kong stock market fell 4% yesterday on fears that domestic interest rates would have to stay high to ward off speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar. One-month market rates rose above 11%, up from 7% last week. However, overnight rates dropped from 20% to 8-10% late in the day on signs that the attack on the currency may be fading away. Many traders said there were no speculative attacks yesterday. Forex strategists believe the currency's peg to the US dollar will survive despite devaluations in the rest of south east Asia since July. They point to the $200bn in foreign exchange reserves held by Hong Kong and China, and to Hong Kong's good economic fundamentals. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

10,1997-08-19,1997-08-20,Financial Times,Cautious S Africa edges up.,"Johannesburg tracked Wall Street higher in the absence of domestic factors to move the market. The industrial index finished 37.4 up at 9,086.4, the all-share index added 35.9 to 7,397.2 and the gold index was up 0.9 to 1,017.6. Trade was cautious ahead of the yesterday's start of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the possibility that Wall Street might respond negatively to the outcome of the gathering. Overall volumes, as on Monday, were moderate with R679.7m traded. Advancing issues led decliners 231 to 143 with another 134 stocks traded but finishing unchanged. Computer company IBM featured ahead of its interim results after the close of trade. The share closed 92 cents up at 870 cents in volume of 115,200 shares. Electronics company Siltek's shares soared after the release of robust results, adding 200 cents to R25. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

11,1997-08-19,1997-08-20,Financial Times,Prices rise on unchanged rates.,"European bond markets continued to trade higher yesterday after the Bundesbank signalled no immediate change to German interest rates. Most attention was on the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which was continuing after the official close of European trading. In the event, the FOMC did not signal any change in interest rates and US TREASURIES were little changed on the announcement from their earlier levels. Soon after the news the benchmark 30-year bond was 1/8 higher at 98 7/32, yielding 6.506%. The two-year note was down 1/16 at 100 1/16 to yield 5.821%, while the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 99 13/32, yielding 6.197%. Economists had said the current evidence favoured no interest rate rise coming from the Fed meeting. Inflation, as measured at the wholesale and consumer levels, had remained calm in spite of the continued low unemployment rate. Analysts have begun to speculate about what it might take for the Fed to raise rates when it meets again in late September. ""If retail sales continue strong, the Fed could move closer to tightening, but it would also require no slowdown in the labour market,"" said M. Cary Leahey, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. The afternoon bond market had been little influenced by a new report on housing starts, which revealed July starts to have been unchanged, following a revised increase of 3.2% for June. ""The market's settled down after last week's debacle, but there is no broad-based interest, with the back end of the curve being buoyed,"" said John ""Rocket"" Spinello, government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. The benign US outlook helped to underpin solid if unspectacular gains earlier in the day in the European markets, which were cheered by the Bundesbank's decision, as expected, to make no change to its securities repurchase (repo) rate. It set a fixed 3% rate tender for its 14-day repo pact. Although largely a technical operation, the move helped GERMAN BUNDS post another day of moderate price gains, but volumes remained light because of holiday factors in the main European markets The September bund futures contract gained another 40 basis points to settle at 102.86. The move also paved the way for a good performance from FRENCH BONDS, with the notional September futures contract adding 32 points to 130.20 in Paris trading. Figures showing German money supply grew at an annualised rate of 5.7% in July, well inside the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 6.5% and down on June's expansion of 6.4%, also gave a fillip to trading, although analysts cautioned that it did not change the medium-term interest rate outlook. Indeed, the belief that German interest rates may have to rise soon is still there, and is dependent on developments in the foreign exchange markets. David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said: ""German interest rate relief will prove fairly short-lived, especially if the dollar-mark rally resumes with a vengeance."" The fall-out from that will have a strong bearing on the direction of high-yielding bond markets, which traded up again yesterday on the back of bund strength. The spread of ITALIAN BTPS over bunds had narrowed to about 103 points in late trading, while the September futures contract settled 48 points higher at 136.00. The September futures contract in SPANISH BONOS gained 30 points to settle at 117.34. High-yielders are now becoming hostage to foreign exchange rate developments, raising doubts about how much further the European monetary union convergence theory can push those markets, some bond market watchers believe. If the dollar regains its upward momentum against the D-Mark, reviving the spectre of a rise in German rates to reverse it, ""that is negative for the German yield curve, and for other markets as well,"" said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America. UK GILTS had an especially quiet session, with the September futures contract unchanged at 115 1/16 in thin trading. The spread over bunds also widened sharply during the day, from an opening level of 150-151 basis points to around 155 points. Most attention was fixed on the release today of retail sales data for July, which will give an indication of the level of consumer spending. It will also give an indication of whether the interest rates have peaked, as the Bank of England has appeared to suggest. Among other markets, IRISH GILT prices also ended higher, buoyed by the successful auction of I# 100m of 8.25% stock due 2015. The National Treasury Management Agency said the auction had been 4.3 times oversubscribed. Shortage of stock remains a key factor underpinning the Irish gilt market.

12,1997-08-19,1997-08-20,Financial Times,D-Mark falls as rate threats fade.,"The D-Mark fell on fresh signs that the Bundesbank would not raise interest rates soon. The bank set its repo tender unchanged at a fixed rate of 3.00% for another week, and reported that growth in M3 money supply was far slower than forecast. M3 grew at a rate of 5.7% for the year to July. The Bundesbank thinks M3 growth is a good indicator of future inflation. Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that there was little need for Germany to raise rates to defend the D-Mark. The dollar's surge of the past year had created ""no inflationary effects"" in Europe, and had helped the European Union, he said. The dollar, helped by a recovery in US stocks after last week's carnage, gained 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.836. It rose Y 0.5 against the yen to Y 118.2, as gloom over the Japanese economy reduced prospects of an interest rate rise this year. Trading was again thin because of summer holidays. The Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting late yesterday also cast a shadow. However, as expected, the FOMC left US interest rates unchanged. The dollar was held back by strong resistance around DM 1.84 to the D-Mark, and by fears that the Bundesbank might try to revive prospects of a rate rise tomorrow, when its council meets for the first time after a four-week summer break. The Bundesbank has repeatedly threatened to move from a fixed to a variable rate repo tender, which could cause rates to creep higher. Euromark futures contracts moved little yesterday and are still pricing in a 25-basis-point German rate rise by September. Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the Bundesbank's apparent tactic of ""leaving an air of uncertainty over the market"" had been as effective as a rate rise at stopping the dollar's ascent. The pound rose 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.950, but fell half a cent against the dollar to $1.606. * The Canadian dollar fell on figures showing that the country's core consumer price index rose just 1.5% in the year to July. That reduced prospects of an interest rate rise. The Canadian dollar fell 0.4 cents against the US dollar to C$1.393, even though the Bank of Canada was seen buying its currency in the market. * The Australian dollar recovered in London trading yesterday from a tumble prompted by a false wire report. The wire quoted the Reserve Bank of Australia as saying that interest rates could be cut again. But the bank's quarterly report on the economy and financial markets had said nothing of the sort. It had merely given a rationale for previous cuts. The wire report had sent the Aussie dollar down to $0.7375, from its Monday close of $0.7423/28. But in trading after the London close yesterday the Aussie dollar was back up at $0.7415/25. The bank's report said the key inflation rate would stay below 2% possibly into 1998. But it also said that current interest rate levels could accommodate stronger growth. This suggested there was little need for another rate cut. Australia's key cash rate has fallen to 5%, below US rate levels. * The Hong Kong stock market fell 4% yesterday on fears that domestic interest rates would have to stay high to ward off speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar. One-month market rates rose above 11%, up from 7% last week. However, overnight rates dropped from 20% to 8-10% late in the day on signs that the attack on the currency may be fading away. Many traders said there were no speculative attacks yesterday. Forex strategists believe the currency's peg to the US dollar will survive despite devaluations in the rest of south east Asia since July. They point to the $200bn in foreign exchange reserves held by Hong Kong and China, and to Hong Kong's good economic fundamentals. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

14,1997-08-19,1997-08-20,Financial Times,Prices rise on unchanged rates.,"European bond markets continued to trade higher yesterday after the Bundesbank signalled no immediate change to German interest rates. Most attention was on the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which was continuing after the official close of European trading.<In the event, the FOMC did not signal any change in interest rates and US TREASURIES were little changed on the announcement from their earlier levels. Soon after the news the benchmark 30-year bond was 1/8 higher at 98 7/32, yielding 6.506%. The two-year note was down 1/16 at 100 1/16 to yield 5.821%, while the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 99 13/32, yielding 6.197%. Economists had said the current evidence favoured no interest rate rise coming from the Fed meeting. Inflation, as measured at the wholesale and consumer levels, had remained calm in spite of the continued low unemployment rate. Analysts have begun to speculate about what it might take for the Fed to raise rates when it meets again in late September. ""If retail sales continue strong, the Fed could move closer to tightening, but it would also require no slowdown in the labour market,"" said M. Cary Leahey, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. The afternoon bond market had been little influenced by a new report on housing starts, which revealed July starts to have been unchanged, following a revised increase of 3.2% for June. ""The market's settled down after last week's debacle, but there is no broad-based interest, with the back end of the curve being buoyed,"" said John ""Rocket"" Spinello, government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York.

15,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times,Yields rise on inflation concerns GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"Government bond prices fell and yields rose round the world yesterday as the US Federal Reserve lifted rates for the 12th consecutive time and markets digested positive economic news and concerns about inflation. US Treasuries initially staged a modest rally after the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed a widely expected interest rate increase, but ended lower. The quarter-point hike took the Fed funds rate to 4 per cent, and the committee's statement left the door open for further increases at a ""measured"" pace. ""They are likely to raise rates at both the December and January meetings, given their positive outlook for growth and concern about inflation,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for October was reported at 59.1, at the high end of expectations. The data also showed signs of inflation. ""For markets, the biggest story is the large increase in prices paid in the last three months, from 48.5 in July to a stunning 84 in the latest month,"" said Alan Ruskin, research director at the 4Cast consultancy. Yields on 10-year Treasuries were up 1.6 basis points at 4.575 per cent late yesterday, still below recent seven-month highs that broke through 4.59 per cent. Two-year yields rose by 3.3bp to 4.419 per cent. Eurozone government bond yields also rose as the Purchasing Managers' Index of European manufacturing activity showed modest gains in October. The report increased the chances the European Central Bank might raise interest rates. ""The ongoing improvement in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone will only help to encourage the hawks on the ECB,"" said analysts at ING. The benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose 1.9bp to 3.411 per cent. The two-year Schatz yielded 2.631 per cent, up 2.3bp. In the UK, gilts also succumbed to selling following better-than-expected data on manufacturing. The 10-year yield rose to 4.341 per cent, up 2bp, while the 2-year yield was 3bp higher at 4.311 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose 3bp to 1.575 per cent, responding to sharp stock market gains. The Bank of Japan's bullish half-yearly report on Monday also continued to give investors a reason to sell JGBs. "
16,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times,Yields rise on inflation concerns GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"Government bond prices fell and yields rose around the world yesterday, as positive economic news and fears of inflation and rate rises dominated the markets. US Treasury yields rose after the Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 4 per cent. The 12th consecutive quarter-point rise in the Fed funds rate was widely expected. The Fed indicated that it would continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace, leaving the door open for further rate rises. ""They are likely to raise rates at both the December and January meetings given their positive outlook for growth and concern about inflation,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for October hit 59.1, at the high end of expectations and near the strong 59.4 reading for September. ""For markets, the biggest story is the large increase in prices paid in the last three months, from 48.5 in July to a stunning 84 in the latest month,"" said Alan Ruskin, research director at the 4Cast consultancy. Yields on 10-year Treasuries were up 1.8 basis points at 4.578 per cent after the Fed announcement although below the recent seven-month highs above 4.59 per cent. Two-year yields rose 1.7bp to 4.403 per cent. Eurozone government bond yields also rose, after the Purchasing Managers' Index of European manufacturing activity showed modest gains in October. The report increased the chances that the European Central Bank might raise interest rates.

17,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times,Fed highlights inflation fears as rates rise.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday pushed its target interest rate up to 4 per cent, highlighted concerns about inflation and said it expected to continue tightening monetary policy. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated its judgment that, following the increase, monetary policy still remained accommodative and said it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. It was the twelfth consecutive quarter point rate increase, stretching back to June of last year. Financial market reaction was limited after a decision that was widely expected, with a slight drop in bond prices and rises in stocks and the dollar. The Fed said that high energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions had temporarily depressed output and employment. ""Monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas,"" the FOMC statement said. It again highlighted inflation risks, saying the ""cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures"" while adding that core inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained. The stress on cumulative energy price increases adds to the impression that a chief concern is a potential pass-through to core inflation after a sustained climb in the oil price. The impact on core inflation has been limited to date. But the 2 per cent rise in the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation in the two months to September is already at the top of the 1-2 per cent ""comfort range"" popularised by former Fed governor Ben Bernanke. Mr Bernanke has been nominated to replace Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. There will be two more meetings of the FOMC, in December and January, before Mr Greenspan is scheduled to step down. The Fed's vote to raise interest rates and signal its intention of continuing to raise rates came in a unanimous vote. While some Fed policymakers think the notion of removing policy accommodation is stale, the current outlook retains majority support among the committee. At 4 per cent, the federal funds rate is no longer obviously a long way below the so-called ""neutral"" level where monetary policy neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. The Fed has maintained the same language as it has raised its target rate by 300 basis points from 1 per cent. Adding to recent data backing the Fed's view that the expansion remains strong the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity remained upbeat. Respondents said that production, new orders and employment rose. But the prices paid index rose from 84 from 78 in September as energy costs jumped. Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 0.5 per cent in September to a new record level of an annualised Dollars 1,120bn, led by increased residential spending. "
18,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Eurozone bond yields hit 15-month high.,"Short-dated eurozone government bonds fell on Wednesday, pushing yields to a 15-month high amid rising expectations for the first interest rate hike in more than two years. The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent for the 29th consecutive month today, but rising expectations that the first rate hike will come before the end of the year or early in 2006 have pushed yields higher. The yield on the two-year Schatz yield rose 4bp to 2.462 per cent, its highest level since late July last year. The 10-year bund yield rose 5.4bp to 3.462 per cent, the highest level since late April this year. A report showing German unemployment falling in October for the forth month in five supported the view that the ECB's neutral stance on interest rates was about to come to an end. Investors will pay close attention to ECB chairman Jean-Claude Trichet's comments at today's press conference for any hints about the bank's view on inflation. US Treasury bonds were mixed, after yields tested seven-month highs and then retreated. Selling continued early on in the wake of Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, helped by stronger economic news and weak government bond prices in Europe. But the move reversed after the Treasury said it would sell $44bn of debt in its quarterly auctions next week. Officials said the department would sell $18bn of three-year notes on Tuesday, $13bn of five-year notes on Wednesday, and $13bn of 10-year paper on Thursday. The Treasury also said it would sell 30-year bonds on February 9 next year for the first time since October 2001. Traders were also cautious ahead of Thursday's Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Friday's key monthly employment report. Yields on 10-year notes tested March highs of about 4.63 per cent before falling back to 4.577 per cent late Friday morning, up 0.8 basis points on the day. The 30-year bond yield was at 4.764 per cent, 0.3bp higher, while the two-year yield was 0.4bp lower at 4.411 per cent. The yield on the benchmark Japanese government ten-year bond slipped 1bp on Wednesday to 1.565 per cent, as dip buyers returned to the market after two days of bond price falls. Longer-dated bonds continued their recent volatility. The 30-year yield fell 4.5bp to a four-month low of 2.340 per cent. "
19,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times,Cheering greets Fed announcement.,"Whooping and hollering traders and soaring stock prices yesterday offered little evidence of the nagging concerns that the Federal Reserve's aggressive 50 basis point rate cut amounted to an admission that problems in the US financial system ran deeper than the Fed's governors first thought.  Charles Diebel, fixed income strategist at Nomura in London, said that by cutting the rate by more than the market expected, the Fed had opted for ""shock and awe"".  Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &Co said he was taken aback by the traders' emphatic response, reacting to the cut ""as if Ben Bernanke (Fed chairman) has come up with a cure for cancer"".  The half percentage point cut, the result of a unanimous decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, surpassed what most people in the market expected. The consensus before the decision had been for a quarter-point cut.  An instant poll of more than 1,000 readers of FT.com showed that two thirds disagreed with the FOMC's decision.  Stocks soared, led by financial stocks and homebuilders, the two sectors most obviously affectedby the subprime mortgage market meltdown of recent months and its resultingfallout.  Trading both on exchange and over-the-counter markets had earlier been relatively light as Wall Street looked to Washington for direction.  Mr Hogan warned that the rate cut could in fact be viewed as an admission that the Fed sees a problem that is bigger than anticipated. Many other observers warned that there might be a reassessment today.  One trader said: ""The market seems to be taking solace in the aggression of the Fed. There were lots of cheers and not a small degree of shock and surprise. But I think there has to be a collective effort not to forget the backdrop of the serious problems in the credit derivatives market.""  Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said: ""In the short term, the market likes pleasant surprises. The initial reaction was that the Fed came to the rescue, almost like the cavalry charging over a hill. But the risk is a hangover as people may ask 'what does the Fed know that we don't?' ""  Interest rate futures continued to price in rate cuts over the next 12 months with three-months rate seen at 4.25 per cent by September 2008, down from 4.45 per cent earlier in the day.  A Funds rate of 4.25 per cent - implying two further cuts of 25bp each - is now priced as a certainty by the meeting in January. At the beginning of the day, the market put the odds of this happening at barely 25 per cent.  The announcement was a surprise: Fed funds futures had pointed to a 33 per cent chance of a 50bp rate cut before the announcement. Analysts said further rate cuts would depend on the nature of forthcoming economic data.  ""The Fed is trying to tread a fine line and the 50bp cut is an attempt to restore confidence in the financial sector,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse. ""The Fed has to wait for a meaningful slowdown in the economy and lower inflation before it can cut again. They are saving their bullets for the economy.""  Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, said: ""This was the right thing to do, although I would have preferred more of a cut in the discount rate.  ""My guess is that more cuts will follow the rather weak data I expect to see this autumn.""  Mr Diebel said that the Fed ""really stepped up to the plate"" by cutting 50bp: a move clearly aimed at crisis of confidence as a result of credit concerns. ""It makes a cut in October look debatable but will not be the only move of the cycle in our view. If the data weaken further as we suspect then another move in December looks likely. The move should lessen some of the money market tensions.""  Citigroup drew a parallel between recent market conditions and those prevailing in 1998. ""History never repeats itself exactly, and the parallels between today's events and those of the Russia/LTCM crisis are not perfect. However, they are symbolic. Fed easing into a disrupted financial system in September-October 1998 was followed by solid equity market gains.""  In a possibly inflationary sign, oil prices climbed to a new high above Dollars 82 a barrel. Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Financial, pointed out that while stocks moved sharply higher, the bond market turned sceptical, in part because the market was adjusting to the reality that the Fed had entered into a risky trade-off between price inflation and economic growth. ""The bond market is essentially saying that the Fed's actions will risk a return to a higher inflation environment, supported by low short-term interest rates and perhaps, more importantly, a substantial decline in the US dollar.""  He pointed out that the action had the potential to usher in a cycle of renewed inflation risks. ""In our view, these risks are not small and, if realised, will be difficult to reverse. In the meantime, the Fed rate cuts are a green light for stocks and commodities.""  "
20,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Regulators rethink bank rules.,"As Northern Rock has crumbled in recent days, Adam Applegarth, chief executive of the UK mortgage lender, has made little attempt to conceal his shock. ""Nobody could [fore]see the squeeze on global liquidity ... Watching liquidity disappear has been astonishing,"" he declared last week, adding that ""life changed on August 9"" when a sudden money market intervention by the European Central Bank revealed a broad freeze in the funding system.  Such comments about the unpredictability of events are unlikely to placate investors in Northern Rock's shares, let alone the depositors who queued to get their money out. But Mr Applegarth's comments highlight a crucial point about the spreading credit squeeze: behind the scenes many other private sector bankers, central bankers and regulators are also expressing astonishment at the turn of events.  Until this summer, most financiers had assumed that it was extremely unlikely that widespread problems in the money markets - on which financial institutions depend to fund their day-to-day operations - would occur. Thus, while financial institutions of almost every hue have been pouring resources into computer models designed to assess future risks, they had spent relatively little time analysing the events that have brought Northern Rock crashing down.  At the Bank of England, for example, officials had this year started warning about liquidity risks and creating new frameworks for measuring these, ahead of almost all of the central bank's counterparts in the western world. But the Bank had not rushed to finish this framework, since it thought a systemic funding freeze was unlikely. ""Nobody expected a complete money market freeze of this kind,"" confesses one senior continental European central banker. ""Every-one was looking for idiosyncratic financial shocks or worrying about subprime or credit being mispriced - that was the focus.""  Or as the treasurer of one big investment bank admits: ""What we are seeing now is like a natural disaster - whole parts of the financial system which we took for granted have stopped working. But that was not something that people had really prepared for.""  To a certain extent, this lack of preparation reflects the perennial tendency of experts in risk management to keep fighting the last financial war - in this case, the implosion of Long Term Capital Management, a US hedge fund, in 1998. The scenario that banks' planning meetings have focused on has been the possibility of another large-scale hedge fund collapse.  In some respects, this LTCM obsession has delivered welcome benefits. This summer, almost two dozen hedge funds ran into serious problems, including two linked to Bear Stearns, the Wall Street investment bank. These jolts have been handled relatively smoothly - in part because banks and regulators prepared so thoroughly for this scenario. ""Hedge funds have not been the issue this time,"" says one senior international regulator, who suggests this outcome may help to defuse demands from politicians for greater regulation of hedge funds in the coming months.  But while a focus on LTCM has helped the industry survive some of this summer's troubles, it may also have distracted risk managers from considering other potential shocks. That in turn highlights a bigger problem: in recent years regulators and investors have tended to play down the risks attached to banks, because they tended to assume that the biggest threats to financial stability lay elsewhere, most notably in unregulated areas such as hedge funds.  The reason for this lopsided view is that a fundamental shift has been under way in the financial system.  Banks used to be considered the dominant pillars of the financial world, since they provided credit to companies and individuals and retained the risk that these loans would turn sour. That meant that if a company defaulted, banks were left on the hook. As a result of this vulnerability, regulators required banks to hold large reserves of spare capital and pools of liquid assets to ensure they could cope with sudden credit shocks.  However, this decade has brought a move to what bankers describe as an ""originate and distribute"" model - meaning that although banks still tend to make (or ""originate"") loans, these are increasingly sold (or ""distributed"") to other capital market investors rather than retained on the banks' books. Since they have been selling on these loans, regulators have assumed that the banks would be less vulnerable if loans turned bad. Thus they have been willing to let the banks hold smaller cushions of capital relative to the volume of loans they create.  This shift towards an ""originate and distribute"" system has been good news for investment bankers, since it has enabled them to increase the volume of business they can do. One reason why Northern Rock, for example, expanded its mortgage book so fast this decade is that when the lender started turning its home loans into securities, regulatory rules permitted it to lend three times as much per unit of capital.  Until now regulators have generally tolerated - if not actively encouraged - this ""originate and distribute"" trend, since there was a widespread belief that the financial system would be safer if credit risk were spread around. In particular, policymakers assumed that the fact that banks were selling risks into the capital markets was making them less vulnerable to any future financial turmoil. Thus, it was presumed that there was now far less chance that a crisis would ever erupt in, say, the interbank lending market than among the hedge funds who were buying the credit risk from banks.  However, this summer's events have shattered some of these comforting assumptions. What has become clear in recent weeks is that banks' offloading of risks into the capital markets has not eliminated their vulnerability to a shock; on the contrary, although banks have shoved risk out through the ""front door"" (as evidenced in their published accounts), they have been re-acquiring it in other, indirect - or backdoor - ways.  One issue creating problems is that banks have been acquiring loans from each other, repackaged as new instruments via the capital markets. Thus as the value of subprime securities has fallen, for example, it has hurt not only the hedge funds and other non-bank institutions but the investment portfolios of banks too.  Another problem is that banks have been selling their credit risk to investment vehicles or conduits. Until recently, it was widely assumed that these were separated from the banks, because they raised finance in the capital markets. But the current crisis has forced banks to prop up these vehicles, by unexpectedly extending liquidity lines - meaning that risky assets are in effect moving back on to the banks' balance sheets again.  Worse still, as the market shock has spread, investors have started to lose confidence in techniques that have underpinned the ""originate and distribute"" model, such as securitisation (or the practice of taking loans and using these to issue bonds).  That, in turn, has made it impossible for banks to sell assets into the capital markets - such as loans to risky borrowers. ""Markets for a wide range of securities have de facto disappeared,"" says Marco Annunziata, chief analyst at Unicredit. The net result of this is that, to cope with an influx of assets, banks are scrambling to plump up the cash cushions they had let grow thin in recent years. In place of the ""originate and distribute"" model, in other words, a new pattern of ""re-intermediation"" is emerging, in which banks are again on the hook for risk. ""Re-intermediation by banks is a likely consequence of the current situation,"" note analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, who warn that this trend will ""stretch capitalisation and reduce returns on assets"" for most banks.  Some think this could herald a sea-change in 21st-century finance that would see banks returning to a much simpler business model instead of endlessly slicing and dicing risk. Others insist that the current pattern is simply a short-term response to a specific financial crisis that will quickly abate.  ""For financial innovation, there is no reverse gear,"" argues Moody's, the credit rating agency (and an institution that has greatly benefited from the securitisation trend in recent years). ""The old days of the bank-based intermediation system are gone. It is improbable that a dramatic reversal, a scaling backof securitisation and credit risk transfer will take place.""  But even if this second view is correct and the ""originate and distribute"" model is here to stay, the recent shocks are already forcing policymakers to rethink some of their approaches. This is likely to trigger some specific, micro-level reforms in the coming months: in the UK, for example, policymakers are scrambling to improve the system for protecting bank depositors from financial turmoil. While officials have been aware for several years that this system contained potential flaws - and had been mulling changes - efforts to reform it had not had much urgency before, precisely because a bank run was considered a low-risk event.  The events of recent weeks may also trigger a broader review, well beyond the UK, of the way regulators treat banks. Central bankers are already considering taking steps to force banks to prepare more effectively for liquidity shocks in their trading operations, for example, when a new set of rules about capital adequacy comes into force next year, known as Basel II.  Some policymakers also think pressure could grow for banks to hold more capital on their books against loans - even if they have sold on the credit risk. ""One of the things we will have to look at is whether we should require banks to hold more capital against stuff they have distributed off their books, but where there is a risk they may need to take this back on to their books for legal or reputational reasons,"" says David Dodge, governor of the Bank of Canada. A rethink is also looming about the treatment of off-balance-sheet vehicles. ""This is an area where there will definitely need to be a debate,"" admits one senior European financial official. Meanwhile, policy-makers of almost every hue are now united in calling for far greater transparency of complex finance. Or as Moody's notes: ""Looking forward, there will be ... a higher demand for capital and liquidity buffers throughout the financial system, which will marginally increase the cost of capital.""  Such measures will be disliked by bankers, who know that a tougher regulatory regime could make finance far less lucrative. But the longer the current market turmoil continues, the more the recriminations will grow - and, with them, the pressures for reform.  One thing is already clear: just as risk managers have spent the last decade discussing LTCM, the next 10 years will now be shaped by an equally intense debate about the lessons to be learnt from Northern Rock and the shock being felt by Mr Applegarth and others.  All at once, interest rates are on the turn  By Crhis Giles  In the space of two short months, financial turmoil in credit markets has blown apart the outlook for interest rates in the world's advanced economies.  Back in mid-July, economists and investors in money markets confidently expected interest rates to be on hold or to rise. The near-universal view was that the US Federal Reserve would hold its target for the Fed funds rate at 5.25 per cent, that the European Central Bank intended to raise its main refinancing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 per cent in September, that the Bank of Japan would find sufficient grounds to push its interest rate up from 0.5 per cent and that the Bank of England was about to raise the price of money, also by a quarter point, to 6 per cent.  Now, the landscape is much changed, with interest rate rises seemingly off the agenda everywhere and central banks cutting rates or considering whether they should loosen monetary policy in response to the financial market upheavals.  In a period when central bankers have been unusually frank behind the scenes about each other's weaknesses in dealing with the chaos in money markets, they are now singing from the same hymn sheet on strategy. Everyone agrees that interest rates should be set low enough to guard against the market havoc having a knock-on effect on the real economy.  The view, plainly expressed by central bankers, is that they increasingly think there will be tangible effects on the economy. This is what led to Tuesday's rate cut in the US as well as a rethink of expected rate rises by other central banks.  Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, took the boldest action by cutting rates to 4.75 per cent and releasing a statement saying: ""Today's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.""  The same logic was apparent in Japan, the world's second largest economy, where the Bank of Japan held interest rates on Wednesday at 0.5 per cent despite a strong desire within the BoJ to restore rates to a more normal level. Toshihiko Fukui, the central bank's governor, warned of growing uncertainty in the global economy in the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis and said: ""It is hard to see signs of improvement. The situation is still unstable.""  He added: ""There is no change in the need to adjust interest rates if the economy moves in line with our scenario.""  While most attention on the Bank of England on Wednesday was focused on its extraordinary U-turn in accepting lower quality collateral in return for central bank money - just days after insisting such action would sow the seeds of a future financial crisis - the minutes of its September rate-setting meeting were published. Looking at five possible ways the UK and global economies could be harmed by the financial market turmoil, the monetary policy committee said the issue was ""the extent to which developments in financial market intermediation would affect the wider economy and hence the outlook for inflation"". The MPC added that it was still too early to know the answer - but the heavy hint was that the market wobbles would reduce both economic growth and upward pressures on inflation, thus opening the door for interest rate cuts.  Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, made the same noises two weeks ago at his monthly press conference and, for the first time, did not raise interest rates the month after uttering the phrase ""strong vigilance"", the ECB's code for a coming rate rise.  Many will see the central banks' actions as tantamount to bailing out the risky decisions of the financial sector, but the policy-makers insist that they distinguish between action to ensure that growth does not slow unnecessarily and inflation does not slow too much on the one hand, and on the other their money market operations designed to ensure financial stability without bailing out banks.  Lower rates will by themselves mean a greater threat of inflation and there are plenty of reminders that such a risk remains serious: oil prices are at record highs, food prices are rising and China, manufacturer to the world, is suffering from an upward spiral in its costs.  The Fed acknowledged that inflation was far from dead when it said on Tuesday that its rate-setting Federal open market committee ""judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully"". Alan Greenspan, Mr Bernanke's predecessor as Fed chairman, has made similar points this week in interviews coinciding with the publication of his memoirs.  This threat of inflation was reflected in bond markets, where a concern was evident that the Fed favoured short-term growth over long-term inflation control. They reacted to the Fed's action by pricing higher inflation expectations into longer-term credits. The long US bond yield rose to 4.76 per cent, while gold rose to a 28-year high of $726.95 an ounce - a further pointer to concerns about the outlook for consumer prices, as the precious metal is seen as the ultimate protection against inflation.  Rising longer-term interest rates might also undermine the central banks' actions when they cut official rates, because these higher market rates offset the effect of the cheaper money lent at shorter maturities.  Two years ago, Mr Greenspan said a global conundrum existed because, however much the Fed raised rates, long-term market rates hardly budged, damping the effect of policymakers' actions. That conundrum might no longer exist but an equally large problem seems to have taken its place.  As central bankers ease monetary policy relative to expectations, investors are beginning to worry about inflation - boosting longer-term interest rates and mitigating the action the policymakers thought was necessary.

21,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall Street continues to climb.,"Wall Street shares continued to surge on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates and were led higher by homebuilder and financial stocks.  Despite disappointing earnings news from Morgan Stanley relatively benign consumer price inflation data galvanised investor confidence as the S&P 500 rose to within 1.4 per cent of its all time high, set in July.  At midday the S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent higher at 1532.42. The Nasdaq Composite index put on 0.8 per cent to 2672.08 while the Dow added 0.7 per cent to 13832.30.  The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies saw particularly buoyant trading, climbing 1.6 per cent to 819.29.  News of a decision by the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies which own or guarantee 40 per cent of US home loans, to allow them to buy more subprime mortgages, caused homebuilder stocks to surge.  The S&P homebuilder index jumped 7.5 per cent in early trading before settling 4.1 per cent higher at midday, despite more bad data on home construction starts.  Of the leading ten sectors, materials led the S&P500, reflecting renewed confidence in the construction sector. Energy stocks continued to attract buyers as oil remained at $81.32, just shy of its record high.  Consumer staples were flat, as traders bet against the possibility of a recession following the larger than anticipated interest rate cut.  ""The Fed's decision to cut both the fed funds rate and discount rate by 50 basis points and the fairly clear language offered by the FOMC statement were meaningful salves for equity markets,"" said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. ""Specifically, 2 per cent surges are usually followed by strong markets in ensuing months.""  Mr Levkovich also said: ""We maintain our constructive view of equity markets for the next six to nine months and remain overweight the Financials,Consumer Discretionary, Technology and Energy sectors. In our minds, it seems late for defensive portfolio positioning though we suspect volatility is still likely to stay elevated.""  Morgan Stanley was the latest broker to report third-quarter earnings and posted a 7 per cent decline in third-quarter profit on continuing operations as it wrote down $940m in loans. The result was below that anticipated by the market.  John Mack, the bank's chief executive, said the quarterly performance reflected the ""impact of the severe market disruption on some areas of the firm, including our credit products, leveraged lending and quantitative strategies businesses.""  Morgan's shares fell 2.2 per cent to $67.80. The stock had climbed 5.5 per cent on Tuesday following news of the Federal Reserve decision.  Lehman Brothers on Tuesday surprised the market by posting a smaller than expected decline in earnings. Lehman's shares closed more than 10 per cent higher but at midday yesterday the stock was off 0.5 per cent.  Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns report their results today and yesterday investors demonstrated a divergent views on the stocks. Goldman was trading 2.2 per cent higher at midday but Bear slid 2.5 per cent to $116.17.  In economic news home starts fell to their lowest level in 12 years, down 2.6 per cent in August. Building permits were also sharply lower, down 5.9 per cent to 1.31m, their lowest level since June 1995.  But the disappointing construction news was overshadowed by a decision by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight to relax restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's home-loan portfolios.  The move is planned to ""provide greater assistance to subprime borrowers and others who may have trouble refinancing their existing mortgages,"" James Lockhart, OFHEO director, said.  Consumer price inflation fell 0.1 per cent in August, the first time overall inflation has declined since October 2006. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 0.2 per cent, in line with analyst expectations.  ""The Fed has embraced the agenda that the credit story of August has given way to an economic story today.""said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  "
22,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall St gains led by homebuilders.,"Wall Street opened higher on Wednesday driven by a strong surge in the homebuilder sector but amid disappointing results from Morgan Stanley. The S&P homebuilder index gained 7.5 per cent in early trade after the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies which own or guarantee 40 per cent of US home loans, said it would allow them to increase their home loan portfolios.  After Wall Street's best day in more than four years on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent, the S&P 500 climbed again on Wednesday, up 0.9 per cent to 1533.11 in early trading, just 1.3 per cent off its all time high.

23,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,FOMC LEAVES US INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED.,"The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee yesterday left US interest rates unchanged, causing a mild surprise to the markets. The decision suggested the Federal Open Markets Committee, which is responsible for setting interest rate policy, was not convinced that signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy warranted tightening. The FOMC's decision left the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.25%. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks, at 5%. Analysts were divided over what effect the decision would have on the dollar, although most considered that a rate rise was now most likely to take place after the US presidential elections in November. With the currency markets in Europe closing before the FOMC decision, trading was generally light and within narrow ranges for most currencies, as the market awaited the interest rate news from the US. The announcement of the UK's buoyant current account and growth figures was followed by sterling making small gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound closed against the dollar at $1.5580 by end of trading in London, up slightly from $1.5569 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling finished at DM 2.3576, up from DM 2.3562. The French franc continued its bullish trend against the D-Mark, climbing to FFr 3.383 from FFr 3.385. The D-Mark continued to trade in a narrow band against other European currencies. But it weakened slightly against the yen, to Y 72.52 compared with Y 72.62. The Swedish krona hit a recent high against the D-Mark in intra-day trading at SKr4.32, after yet another cut in the Swedish central bank's repo rate. The krona finished the day at SKr4.351, up from SKr4.359. The Italian lira was stable at L1,006. But Italian government debt markets rose strongly on positive inflation data and growing confidence in the government's ability to pass its 1997 budget through parliament. The benchmark December government bond futures contract rose to a contract high of 119.20, slipping back to a close of 119.15. * Britain recorded its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996, and its annual rate of economic growth was revised up to 2.2% yesterday. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed a #457m ($712m) surplus after a deficit of #786m in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around #1.2bn. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro bank in London, said the current account data was good news for the British economy and for sterling. ""The lack of a base rate cut should help sterling - it seems pretty unlikely we'll see any more base rate cuts for a while,"" he said. Official interest rates appeared to have been left unchanged at 5.75% after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Bank of England. * The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, showed its faith in the country's economic recovery by cutting interest rates for the twentieth time this year.<Its latest quarterly report on economic and monetary policy said inflation in Sweden was under control. After the publication of the inflation report, the central bank cut its key repo rate by 10 basis points to 5.05%. The repo rate has now dropped by nearly four percentage points, from 8.91% in January. * Mr Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, said Italy would face economic ruin if it failed to join Emu. ""There can no longer be a situation where some arrive first and others later, but there will be a large number of countries that enter right away,"" Mr Prodi said. ""Not being among these countries means economic ruin for Italy,"" he said. Mr Prodi said Italy's 1997 budget, due to be presented on Friday, would help Italy clinch a place in Emu.

24,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,CREDIOP ISSUES SEVEN-YEAR FRNS TO RAISE DM 500M.,"As the bond markets' tense vigil for the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting continued, activity in the eurobond market dried to a trickle, with only a handful of new issues surfacing yesterday. The largest deal of the day was a DM 500m floating-rate offering for Crediop, the Italian financial institution that lends to local authorities. Crediop's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Aa3 in July, making it one of the few Italian issuers with the same rating as the state. Moreover, forthcoming redemptions of D-Mark floating-rate paper are expected to provide good support for the transaction, said a syndicate manager at Paribas, joint book-runner with HSBC Trinkaus. ""More than DM 1bn of floating-rate notes are maturing in September and October, and we hope this deal will benefit from some reinvestment demand,"" he said. He reported demand from banks in the Benelux region and Italy, as well as money market funds in the UK and France, in spite of the deal's relatively tight pricing. At the re-offer price, the notes paid a spread of 5.7 basis points over Libor, which widened to full fees - 9 basis points over Libor - in the course of the day, in line with Crediop's dollar-denominated FRNs. In the sterling sector, Yorkshire Building Society issued #200m of five-year floating-rate notes, increased from the initial launch size of #150m due to strong demand, an official at lead Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson said. While it is only the 10th largest UK building society in terms of assets, it ranks third in UBS's relative creditworthiness league table of building societies, after the Halifax and Northern Rock, both of which are due to convert to banks next year. Most of the paper went to UK corporates and financial institutions, he said. In France, Merrill Lynch increased a FFr 1bn issue of 10-year bonds, launched in May at a spread of 51 basis points, by another FFr 1.5bn yielding only 43 basis points over French government bonds. The deal's strong spread performance, which had seen the differential tighten to as little as 38 basis points, lent good support to the new tranche, an official at Banque Paribas, one of the joint leads, said. Also in the French franc sector, dealers are awaiting the next foray by Cades, the government entity set up to manage the country's accumulated social security debts. It is expected to issue up to FFr 20bn - possibly in two tranches of differing maturities - as early as this week. In the emerging markets, the Philippine jumbo 20-year bond, which on Monday had tightened from its launch spread of 225 basis points to 220 basis points, continued to trade well and closed at a spread of 218 basis points over Treasuries. The rest of the sector was muted by the FOMC meeting, but dealers are looking to the forthcoming D-Mark issues for Colombia and the Czech Republic's Komercni Banka.

25,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"The derivatives sector was marking time yesterday as dealers waited for the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened on a firm note at 3,954, well ahead of its previous close. Early buying, said to have been mainly by independent (local) traders, saw the contract rise steadily to 3,969. This turned out to be the high of the day as the more cautious view on the interest rate outlook gained the upper hand. December drifted lower for the rest of the morning but later settled to trade in a tight range of 3,940 to 3,950. The early falls on Wall Street did little to improve sentiment while a false rumour about a resignation from the UK government only served to increase the gloom surrounding the market. The contract closed at 3,945, up 2 on its previous close and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 33 points. Turnover rose slightly and closed at 10,809 contracts. Volume in the traded options also improved and reached 43,776 contracts against 37,227 lots on Monday. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 19,309 lots while 14,584 was dealt in the Euro FT-SE contract. BP was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,015 trades.

26,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,US SHARES MIXED AFTER RATE NEWS.,"Investors showed a mixed reaction to news that the Federal Reserve had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting of its Open Market Committee, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Bluechip shares in the Dow Jones Industrial Average initially surged on the news and then almost as quickly fell back into negative territory in part because of pressure from AT&T, which issued a profits warning early yesterday morning. Just before 3pm the Dow was off 13.68 at 5,881.06 and the Standard &Poor's 500 slipped 0.86 at 686.66 while the American Stock Exchange composite added 0.74 at 564.36. Wall Street economists had been sharply divided over whether the Fed's policy making body would raise interest rates. Technology shares mostly remained higher as they rebounded from the drop seen on Monday. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighted toward that sector, added 3.33 at 1,214.80 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index climbed 1.1%.<Semiconductor shares were particularly strong. Intel added $1 1/4 at $97, Applied Materials was up $1 3/8 at $27 5/8, Micron Technology climbed $2 1/2 at $30 1/2, Texas Instruments added $3 1/2 at $55 1/4, Motorola was $1 1/4 stronger at $52 5/8 and National Semiconductor climbed $1 3/8 at $20 1/2. Telecommunications shares were sharply lower on the heels of a warning from the industry giant, AT&T, that competitive pressures in the long distance business would push third quarter earnings as much as 10% below analysts' estimates. AT&T, which is a component of the Dow, was off $5 3/8 or 9% at $51 7/8, MCI Communications shed $1 3/8 or 5% at $25 3/4 and Sprint gave up $1 1/2 or 4% at $40. Interest rate sensitive commercial banks were mostly flat ahead of FOMC news. Citicorp was $1/4 stronger at $89 5/8, Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at $79 3/8 and JP Morgan shed $1 at $88 3/4. Pan Am World Airways rose in their first day of trading on the American stock Exchange. Shares in the newest reincarnation of the well-known carrier were priced at $15 and by 1pm had risen by $1 to $16. Shares in Revco gained $1 1/8 or 4% at $26 7/8 after the drug store chain said that its first quarter earnings were 21 cents a share, 6 cents ahead of analysts' estimates.

27,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,TREASURIES OFF HIGHS AS FED HOLDS RATES.,"US Treasuries surged and then fell back from their highs on news that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had left interest rates unchanged. Bonds began rising in early afternoon and then moved sharply higher at 2:15pm when the news was announced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury dipped below 7% on the news, but some 45 minutes later moved back above the psychologically important level. By late afternoon the long bond was 5/32 stronger at 96 to yield 7.008%. Shorter maturity Treasuries however, managed to hold on to a good portion of their gains, with the two-year note climbing 5/32 to 99 15/16 to yield 6.140%.<The curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries jumped by eight basis points. Wall Street economists had been almost evenly divided about whether the Fed would raise the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points or leave it steady. At mid-morning bonds moved modestly lower on news of a jump in the consumer confidence index since the start of the summer. Reaction to the figures, however, was overshadowed by the market's focus on the FOMC meeting. The Conference Board said that it had revised its August figure to 112 - its highest level in nearly six years - and that the index was only modestly lower at 111.8 in September. The August figure was originally reported as 109.4. * European government bond markets languished as traders waited nervously for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Trading ranges in most markets were narrow and volumes low, and where significant price changes did occur, they were mostly driven by mark-ups in the futures markets. ""No investor flows were backing the rally"", said Mr Graham McDevitt, a bond strategist at Paribas. * Italian government bonds had the most volatile day among European markets, weakening in the morning on stronger than expected consumer price data released after the close of the market late Monday by five Italian cities. However, mounting hopes that the government could push through a convincing 1997 budget package helped the market recoup its losses during the afternoon. Traders also cited hopes that further inflation data would show that Monday's figures were an aberration. ""If the government comes up with the goods on the 1997 budget and the Bank of Italy are impressed enough, it won't be too long before we should expect to see rate cuts entering back into the equation again,"" said Mr David Brown, chief international economist at Bear Stearns. The BTP contract on Liffe rose by 0.46 to settle at 119.17, before reaching an all-time high of 119.34 in after-hours trading. * UK gilts traded in a very narrow range, ending the day flat or slightly higher. Liffe's December long gilt future settled at 107 15/32, up 3/32. In the cash market, the 10-year gilt was 3/32 higher at 97 3/8, its yield spread over the equivalent bund 3 basis points wider at 180 points. This spread is now some 15 points wider than at the beginning of the month. ""Gilts have not only underperformed bunds, but all European markets in recent weeks"", said Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS. ""Yield convergence has resumed in Europe, but gilts are not part of it."" Mr Roberts also said ""economic fundamentals are against the gilt market"", with high spending growth and consumer price inflation constantly overshooting the Bank of England's 2.5% target. ""Only an end to the convergence process could help gilts, by attracting funds out of the high-yielding markets"", he said. * Swedish government debt ended mostly unchanged, after rising in early trading on abullish central bank report on inflation, while the krona firmed to SKr4.352 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.361 on Monday. Six-month and nine-year yields closed flat at 4.78% and 7.65% respectively, despite a 10 basis point cut in the repo rate to 5.05%. * Spanish bonds ended little changed in quiet trading, with the December bond future rising 0.12 to 105.38 on moderate volume. Bonds opened higher, but slipped back when the Bank of Spain kept its key interest rate at 7.25%. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
28,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"The derivatives sector was marking time yesterday as dealers waited for the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened on a firm note at 3,954, well ahead of its previous close. Early buying, said to have been mainly by independent (local) traders, saw the contract rise steadily to 3,969. This turned out to be the high of the day as the more cautious view on the interest rate outlook gained the upper hand. December drifted lower for the rest of the morning but later settled to trade in a tight range of 3,940 to 3,950. The early falls on Wall Street did little to improve sentiment while a false rumour about a resignation from the UK government only served to increase the gloom surrounding the market. The contract closed at 3,945, up 2 on its previous close and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 33 points. Turnover rose slightly and closed at 10,809 contracts. Volume in the traded options also improved and reached 43,776 contracts against 37,227 lots on Monday. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 19,309 lots while 14,584 was dealt in the Euro FT-SE contract. BP was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,015 trades.

29,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,US SHARES MIXED AFTER RATE NEWS.,"Investors showed a mixed reaction to news that the Federal Reserve had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting of its Open Market Committee, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Bluechip shares in the Dow Jones Industrial Average initially surged on the news and then almost as quickly fell back into negative territory in part because of pressure from AT&T, which issued a profits warning early yesterday morning. Just before 3pm the Dow was off 13.68 at 5,881.06 and the Standard &Poor's 500 slipped 0.86 at 686.66 while the American Stock Exchange composite added 0.74 at 564.36. Wall Street economists had been sharply divided over whether the Fed's policy making body would raise interest rates. Technology shares mostly remained higher as they rebounded from the drop seen on Monday. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighted toward that sector, added 3.33 at 1,214.80 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index climbed 1.1%. Semiconductor shares were particularly strong. Intel added $1 1/4 at $97, Applied Materials was up $1 3/8 at $27 5/8, Micron Technology climbed $2 1/2 at $30 1/2, Texas Instruments added $3 1/2 at $55 1/4, Motorola was $1 1/4 stronger at $52 5/8 and National Semiconductor climbed $1 3/8 at $20 1/2. Telecommunications shares were sharply lower on the heels of a warning from the industry giant, AT&T, that competitive pressures in the long distance business would push third quarter earnings as much as 10% below analysts' estimates. AT&T, which is a component of the Dow, was off $5 3/8 or 9% at $51 7/8, MCI Communications shed $1 3/8 or 5% at $25 3/4 and Sprint gave up $1 1/2 or 4% at $40. Interest rate sensitive commercial banks were mostly flat ahead of FOMC news. Citicorp was $1/4 stronger at $89 5/8, Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at $79 3/8 and JP Morgan shed $1 at $88 3/4. Pan Am World Airways rose in their first day of trading on the American stock Exchange. Shares in the newest reincarnation of the well-known carrier were priced at $15 and by 1pm had risen by $1 to $16. Shares in Revco gained $1 1/8 or 4% at $26 7/8 after the drug store chain said that its first quarter earnings were 21 cents a share, 6 cents ahead of analysts' estimates.

30,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,TREASURIES OFF HIGHS AS FED HOLDS RATES.,"US Treasuries surged and then fell back from their highs on news that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had left interest rates unchanged. Bonds began rising in early afternoon and then moved sharply higher at 2:15pm when the news was announced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury dipped below 7% on the news, but some 45 minutes later moved back above the psychologically important level. By late afternoon the long bond was 5/32 stronger at 96 to yield 7.008%. Shorter maturity Treasuries however, managed to hold on to a good portion of their gains, with the two-year note climbing 5/32 to 99 15/16 to yield 6.140%. The curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries jumped by eight basis points. Wall Street economists had been almost evenly divided about whether the Fed would raise the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points or leave it steady. At mid-morning bonds moved modestly lower on news of a jump in the consumer confidence index since the start of the summer. Reaction to the figures, however, was overshadowed by the market's focus on the FOMC meeting. The Conference Board said that it had revised its August figure to 112 - its highest level in nearly six years - and that the index was only modestly lower at 111.8 in September. The August figure was originally reported as 109.4. * European government bond markets languished as traders waited nervously for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Trading ranges in most markets were narrow and volumes low, and where significant price changes did occur, they were mostly driven by mark-ups in the futures markets. ""No investor flows were backing the rally"", said Mr Graham McDevitt, a bond strategist at Paribas. * Italian government bonds had the most volatile day among European markets, weakening in the morning on stronger than expected consumer price data released after the close of the market late Monday by five Italian cities. However, mounting hopes that the government could push through a convincing 1997 budget package helped the market recoup its losses during the afternoon. Traders also cited hopes that further inflation data would show that Monday's figures were an aberration. ""If the government comes up with the goods on the 1997 budget and the Bank of Italy are impressed enough, it won't be too long before we should expect to see rate cuts entering back into the equation again,"" said Mr David Brown, chief international economist at Bear Stearns. The BTP contract on Liffe rose by 0.46 to settle at 119.17, before reaching an all-time high of 119.34 in after-hours trading. * UK gilts traded in a very narrow range, ending the day flat or slightly higher. Liffe's December long gilt future settled at 107 15/32, up 3/32. In the cash market, the 10-year gilt was 3/32 higher at 97 3/8, its yield spread over the equivalent bund 3 basis points wider at 180 points. This spread is now some 15 points wider than at the beginning of the month. ""Gilts have not only underperformed bunds, but all European markets in recent weeks"", said Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS. ""Yield convergence has resumed in Europe, but gilts are not part of it."" Mr Roberts also said ""economic fundamentals are against the gilt market"", with high spending growth and consumer price inflation constantly overshooting the Bank of England's 2.5% target. ""Only an end to the convergence process could help gilts, by attracting funds out of the high-yielding markets"", he said. * Swedish government debt ended mostly unchanged, after rising in early trading on abullish central bank report on inflation, while the krona firmed to SKr4.352 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.361 on Monday. Six-month and nine-year yields closed flat at 4.78% and 7.65% respectively, despite a 10 basis point cut in the repo rate to 5.05%. * Spanish bonds ended little changed in quiet trading, with the December bond future rising 0.12 to 105.38 on moderate volume.

31,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,FOMC LEAVES US INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED.,"The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee yesterday left US interest rates unchanged, causing a mild surprise to the markets. The decision suggested the Federal Open Markets Committee, which is responsible for setting interest rate policy, was not convinced that signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy warranted tightening. The FOMC's decision left the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.25%. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks, at 5%. Analysts were divided over what effect the decision would have on the dollar, although most considered that a rate rise was now most likely to take place after the US presidential elections in November. With the currency markets in Europe closing before the FOMC decision, trading was generally light and within narrow ranges for most currencies, as the market awaited the interest rate news from the US. The announcement of the UK's buoyant current account and growth figures was followed by sterling making small gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound closed against the dollar at $1.5580 by end of trading in London, up slightly from $1.5569 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling finished at DM 2.3576, up from DM 2.3562. The French franc continued its bullish trend against the D-Mark, climbing to FFr 3.383 from FFr 3.385. The D-Mark continued to trade in a narrow band against other European currencies. But it weakened slightly against the yen, to Y 72.52 compared with Y 72.62. The Swedish krona hit a recent high against the D-Mark in intra-day trading at SKr4.32, after yet another cut in the Swedish central bank's repo rate. The krona finished the day at SKr4.351, up from SKr4.359. The Italian lira was stable at L1,006. But Italian government debt markets rose strongly on positive inflation data and growing confidence in the government's ability to pass its 1997 budget through parliament. The benchmark December government bond futures contract rose to a contract high of 119.20, slipping back to a close of 119.15. * Britain recorded its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996, and its annual rate of economic growth was revised up to 2.2% yesterday. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed a #457m ($712m) surplus after a deficit of #786m in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around #1.2bn. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro bank in London, said the current account data was good news for the British economy and for sterling. ""The lack of a base rate cut should help sterling - it seems pretty unlikely we'll see any more base rate cuts for a while,"" he said. Official interest rates appeared to have been left unchanged at 5.75% after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Bank of England. * The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, showed its faith in the country's economic recovery by cutting interest rates for the twentieth time this year. Its latest quarterly report on economic and monetary policy said inflation in Sweden was under control. After the publication of the inflation report, the central bank cut its key repo rate by 10 basis points to 5.05%. The repo rate has now dropped by nearly four percentage points, from 8.91% in January. * Mr Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, said Italy would face economic ruin if it failed to join Emu. ""There can no longer be a situation where some arrive first and others later, but there will be a large number of countries that enter right away,"" Mr Prodi said. ""Not being among these countries means economic ruin for Italy,"" he said. Mr Prodi said Italy's 1997 budget, due to be presented on Friday, would help Italy clinch a place in Emu.

32,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,CREDIOP ISSUES SEVEN-YEAR FRNS TO RAISE DM 500M.,"As the bond markets' tense vigil for the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting continued, activity in the eurobond market dried to a trickle, with only a handful of new issues surfacing yesterday. The largest deal of the day was a DM 500m floating-rate offering for Crediop, the Italian financial institution that lends to local authorities. Crediop's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Aa3 in July, making it one of the few Italian issuers with the same rating as the state. Moreover, forthcoming redemptions of D-Mark floating-rate paper are expected to provide good support for the transaction, said a syndicate manager at Paribas, joint book-runner with HSBC Trinkaus. ""More than DM 1bn of floating-rate notes are maturing in September and October, and we hope this deal will benefit from some reinvestment demand,"" he said. He reported demand from banks in the Benelux region and Italy, as well as money market funds in the UK and France, in spite of the deal's relatively tight pricing. At the re-offer price, the notes paid a spread of 5.7 basis points over Libor, which widened to full fees - 9 basis points over Libor - in the course of the day, in line with Crediop's dollar-denominated FRNs. In the sterling sector, Yorkshire Building Society issued #200m of five-year floating-rate notes, increased from the initial launch size of #150m due to strong demand, an official at lead Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson said. While it is only the 10th largest UK building society in terms of assets, it ranks third in UBS's relative creditworthiness league table of building societies, after the Halifax and Northern Rock, both of which are due to convert to banks next year. Most of the paper went to UK corporates and financial institutions, he said. In France, Merrill Lynch increased a FFr 1bn issue of 10-year bonds, launched in May at a spread of 51 basis points, by another FFr 1.5bn yielding only 43 basis points over French government bonds. The deal's strong spread performance, which had seen the differential tighten to as little as 38 basis points, lent good support to the new tranche, an official at Banque Paribas, one of the joint leads, said. Also in the French franc sector, dealers are awaiting the next foray by Cades, the government entity set up to manage the country's accumulated social security debts. It is expected to issue up to FFr 20bn - possibly in two tranches of differing maturities - as early as this week. In the emerging markets, the Philippine jumbo 20-year bond, which on Monday had tightened from its launch spread of 225 basis points to 220 basis points, continued to trade well and closed at a spread of 218 basis points over Treasuries. The rest of the sector was muted by the FOMC meeting, but dealers are looking to the forthcoming D-Mark issues for Colombia and the Czech Republic's Komercni Banka.

33,2003-06-25,2003-06-26,Financial Times,Drawn and quartered - THE LEX COLUMN.,"By opting for a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate, rather than the half-point favoured by one of its members, the Federal Open Market Committee has left room for a further reduction. It has also postponed the day when it must embrace the high-risk strategy of unconventional action. We must now wait and see if the second-half recovery which the Fed is hoping for - and which the stock market has priced in - materialises. Consumer spending has kept the economy afloat, but a more robust recovery requires businesses to start spending. May's durable goods orders - with core non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft dropping by 0.5 per cent following April's 2.6 per cent decline - was the latest piece of evidence confirming that the post-war snapback is long in coming. Corporate America continues to focus on balance sheet repair. The saving grace is that, encouraged by a still-buoyant housing market, underwritten by the Fed's efforts, and with tax cuts to come, the repair of US household balance sheets has been postponed. Yesterday's statement repeated the soothing, two-pronged approach adopted in May: the upside and downside risks to growth are roughly balanced, but the risk of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation. This is a difficult balancing act. If the economic recovery does not materialise, equity markets will fall; but if it does, the bond market's recent weakness could quickly turn into a fierce reversal. London Edition 1. "
34,1995-11-15,1995-11-16,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - FRENCH DEFICIT NEWS LIFTS EUROPEAN SECTOR.,"Positive news on the French fiscal deficit combined with fundamentals pointing to lower growth and waning inflationary pressure buoyed the European bond markets yesterday. The German and UK markets rose strongly in morning trading before losing some ground in the afternoon due to a combination of profit-taking and disappointing inflation statistics in the US. The dollar stabilised, but its weakness in Asia overnight contributed to underperformance by high-yielding bonds, with the 10-year yield spread of Italian bonds over German bunds widening by 3 basis points to 535 points. French bonds responded positively to news of the government's plans to reduce its social security deficit. Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the deficit would fall to FFr 17bn in 1996. On Matif the 10-year December future gained more than half a point, while the three-month Pibor contract closed up 0.10 at 94.17, continuing its strong recent advance. German bond prices rose strongly after a cut in the securities repurchase rate fanned expectations of a reduction in interest rates. The repo rate cut of two basis points was in line with expectations, taking it down to 3.98%. Mr Graham McDevitt bond strategist with Banque Paribas, said the change in the headline number from 'four' to 'three' had an important 'psychological impact' on the markets. There are hopes in some quarters that the discount rate could be reduced when the Bundesbank's council meets today. 'While the market call is for no change in official rates, we are definitely entering the 'amber alert zone' now for an early German rate cut,' said Mr David Brown at Bear Stearns. 'We tend to put the chances of a 25 basis point discount rate cut at 50:50 tomorrow, as all the pre-conditions are pointing to lower rates.' Fresh economic data in the UK provided further evidence that the economy is slowing and helped gilts continue their rally. On Liffe, the December long gilt contract surged to a high of 108 3/8, before falling back in the afternoon, partially as a result of sterling weakness. It closed at 107 31/32, down 5/32. US Treasury prices ended lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee finished its meeting without changing monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was unchanged at 107 27/32 to yield 6.283%, while the two-year note slipped 3/32 to 100 3/16, yielding 5.504%. Few on Wall Street believed the FOMC would cut rates before Congress and the president had agreed to a deficit-cutting package, but traders said there was some buying early yesterday on hopes that the Fed might surprise the market. Once the FOMC meeting was over, however, attention turned to the new supply due next week when the Treasury is to hold auctions of three-year and 10-year notes that have been delayed since last week. In Washington, skirmishing continued between Congress and the administration over a deficit-reducing budget package but Mr Robert Rubin, treasury secretary, said his actions to circumvent the debt ceiling should allow the Treasury to continue making payments until at least late December. Economic data released yesterday was mixed. Industrial production was down 0.3% in October, but September's figure was revised to an increase of 0.1% from the originally reported decline of 0.2%. Capacity utilisation slipped to 83.6 in October from 84.1 in September. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
35,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS FUNDS RATE TO 5.75%.,"The dollar yesterday fell slightly after the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%, writes Philip Gawith. An early assessment of the impact of the Fed's move was that it could help the dollar if, as has been the case recently, it took its lead from the bond market which responded positively. Further out, however, the prognoses is more negative, with some analysts predicting that the removal of interest rate support would cause it to retest historic lows around DM 1.3450. In the immediate aftermath of the Fed's announcement, the dollar was trading around DM 1.3780, down from the London close of DM 1.3816. Against the yen it traded at Y 85.14. It finished in New York at DM 1.3789 and Y 84.955. Foreign exchanges had earlier had a very quiet day, with traders and investors content to take to the sidelines until the outcome of the FOMC meeting was known. Sterling maintained its firmer tone, with the trade weighted index closing at 83.6 from 83.3. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM 2.2087, from DM 2.2019. Against the dollar it closed at $1.5987 from $1.5918. Elsewhere, there were interest rate cuts in France and Denmark. The Bank of France, as expected, cut the 5-10 day lending rate to 7.25% from 7.5%, while in Denmark the discount rate was cut to 5.75% from 6%. Pessimism about the dollar's medium term outlook stems from the fear that the market will see this cut in rates as the first of a sequence. 'If a 6% funds rate could not hold the currency, there is little chance of a 5 3/4% rate doing any better,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London endorsed this view, but said the dollar would be more stable against the yen because there were signs that Japanese investors were diversifying from yen assets to D-Mark assets. Certainly, there is broad agreement that developments in Japan remain critical to developments on the dollar. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the key issue was the recapitalisation of the banking system, necessary if financial flows out of the country were to be unblocked. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said there were two conflicting views of the currency implications of developments in Japan. One view was that further weakness in the Nikkei would prompt repatriation of offshore assets by Japanese investors, further strengthening the yen. The other view, held by Mr Chertkow, is that the strong yen is already fully discounted (the forward rate one year out is Y 81.15), with capital market participants preparing to take more money out of Japan. The recent pattern in UK money markets of fairly tight liquidity conditions persisted, with overnight money rising to 7 3/8% as the Bank of England provided only #454m at established rates towards clearing a #850m shortage. It provided #210m late assistance. Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union plc, said he detected that the Bank had 'once again become awkward in buying bills from the market'. He suggested three possible motives: First, it wanted to ensure that three-month LIBOR did not fall below the 6.75% base rate, as it had done for most of the March-June period. Second, 'it may be paying more attention to one-month LIBOR. This is currently at 6.63% and barring just a few occasions has been continually below base rates since mid-1994. In fact, over the past year the one-month/base rate spread has averaged -22 basis points; typically it is close to zero. Third, with the Bank known to be concerned about currency weakness, keeping overnight rates firm was a disincentive to shorting the pound. The franc was barely changed after rates were cut, finishing at FFr 3.498 per D-Mark from FFr 3.497. Mr Chertkow predicted that the Bank of France might well, in the months ahead, be more aggressive than the Bundesbank in cutting rates. Taking a minority view, he said lower rates would be well received in financial markets as a vote of confidence in French fiscal policy. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
36,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES RALLY AFTER CUT IN FED FUNDS RATE.,"US Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee cut the Federal funds target rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1 13/32 higher at 114 9/16 to yield 6.505. At the short end of the maturity spectrum, the two-year note jumped 3/4 at 100 1/8 to yield 5.540. In lowering interest rates the FOMC said that 'inflationary pressures have receded enough to accommodate a modest adjustment in monetary conditions'. This added to the bond rally by suggesting that the members of the Fed were not concerned about inflation, which can erode the value of long-term bonds. Bonds have rallied since early June as a string of weak economic data suggested to many investors that the Fed might lower interest rates this week. Early yesterday, however, bonds slipped in quiet trading amid renewed fears that the Fed might leave rates steady. Both the index of leading economic indicators and the weekly release of data on new claims for unemployment benefits were in line with economists' expectations and therefore failed to move the bond market. Soon after the announcement of the rate cut, traders turned their attention to June unemployment figures set to be released today. The median economic estimate holds that non-farm jobs will have increased by about 125,000 to reverse May's 101,000 decline, but the figure is expected to be an important factor when the Fed meets to consider interest rate policy again next month. Mr Bill Curtin, chief fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, said he thought the report could be stronger than expected and that might spook investors. But, he added, in general the economy is relatively weak which should be good for Treasuries in the longer term. European government bonds fell back yesterday as traders awaited the FOMC decision. German government bonds declined in spite of favourable unemployment data. Reports of comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, which suggested that he saw little scope for a cut in German interest rates for the time being, depressed bunds in early trading. Dealers today will be focusing on US non-farm payroll data. French government bonds fell sharply in spite of a move by the Bank of France to lower its five to 10-day lending rate to 7.25%. Fresh supply, following a FFr 21bn auction of OATs, weighed on prices at the long end of the market. Traders said the cut in the lending rate had already been priced into the market. But Mr Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets, said there could be further cuts soon, probably as early as next week, following comments earlier this week by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France. Mr Trichet said that the new French budget was stringent enough for the central bank to allow interest rates to 'return progressively to a normal level'. Mr Roberts thinks that there are further gains to be made at the short end of the French market. He said the French yield curve is currently very flat - with the spread in yields between two and 10-year bonds at 109 basis points, compared with 171 in Germany - which means that the curve could steepen in coming days with the short-end outperforming. The September notional futures contract on Matif settled down 0.6 point at 114.04. UK government bonds fell back, although they outperformed most other European markets. They rose in early trading with dealers reporting flows out of bunds into gilts, primarily on the futures exchange. The spread over bunds narrowing to 158 basis points, before gilts fell back in later trade. The spread over bunds settled at around 160 basis points. The long gilt future on Liffe was at 104 7/32 in late trade, up 1/32 on the day. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
37,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - ELECTRONICS STOCKS LEAD THE WAY AHEAD.,"With many of the Continental markets blighted by the long wait for news of the outcome of the FOMC meeting in the US, the sharp outperformance of high-technology companies provided bright spots in some of the bourses. AMSTERDAM broke through a new barrier but just failed at the finish to set a new all-time high, as the AEX index ended 1.34 firmer at 440.04. It had earlier seen an intraday peak of 440.73. There was no stopping Philips, which steered the market to its high, the shares gaining Fl 2.70 or nearly 4% at Fl 72.30, and just off a high of Fl 72.70. Polygram made 70 cents to Fl 93.90. All the action was not one way, however. There was further bad news for Fokker, which said that it expected the first-half net loss to be higher than that seen over 1994, which was Fl 449m. This would mean that shareholders equity would fall well below half of the issued share capital, the company added. The stock plunged Fl 1.10 or 10% to Fl 9.80. Royal Dutch was hit by the possibility of a US law suit, tumbling Fl 2.10 to Fl 188.30. STOCKHOLM's attention remained focused on Ericsson in an otherwise cautious market which saw the Affarsvarlden index rise 6.3 to another all-time high of 1,681.3. Ericsson added SKr2 at SKr154, extending Wednesday's gain on further optimism about the outlook for the sector and expectations that Ericsson would secure more orders for PCs from the US. HELSINKI continued higher in heavy trade, again led by Nokia, the telecommunications group, which took the Hex index up 40.57 to a new record of 2,079.03. Nokia A hit a record high of NKr275 in intraday trade before closing FM10 ahead at FM272. PARIS was unimpressed by the easing in the five to 10-day rate, which had been widely expected. The CAC-40 index drifted off 18.27 to 1,889.49 in turnover of some FFr 3bn. There was another twist to the Suez story, with rumours that Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman of the conglomerate, might resign at today's board meeting. Such a decision would not be unexpected given the conflict of opinion on the future direction of Suez by Mr Worms and the major shareholders, such as UAP and BNP.

Accor, the hotels and restaurants group, declined FFr 17 to FFr 663 as investors considered the sale of its Eurest division to Compass, of the UK. While the sale was generally considered to be positive in the long term and would improve the company's eps, the shares slipped as profits were booked.

The day's low of 14,759.85 came towards the end of the morning session. The broader based Topix index finished nearly 2% or 23.77 ahead at 1,236.79 and the Nikkei 300 index put on 4.36 at 230.40. Volume expanded to an estimated 341m shares from Wednesday's 277.5m. Gains led declines by 891 to 143, with 124 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.87 at 1,035.52. But analysts dismissed the possibility that the day's move was the start of a significant turnaround. 'This is not the beginning of a huge rally,' said Mr Neil Rogers, strategist with UBS in Tokyo. 'I do not think any fundamentals have changed to justify a rally.' Ms Kathy Matsui at Goldman Sachs said the quality of stocks driving the rally was poor, being mainly speculative issues. 'There was also a lot of futures covering at the end of the day,' she added.

39,1998-12-22,1998-12-23,Financial Times,US manufacturers call for tax cut as Fed holds interest rates.,"US manufacturing industry has called for a 10% tax cut for companies and individuals as a way of sustaining the country's seven-year economic expansion. The call came as the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and as new forecasts predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year. The National Association of Manufacturers said a 10% tax cut, costing $80bn ( #47.6bn) a year, would lead to sharp increases in consumption and investment. Otherwise, it said economic growth would slow next year to about 2.1%, down from 3.6% this year and below potential output growth of 3%. The tax cut, it said, would allow growth next year of 3%, rising to 4% in 2000 and 2.9% in 2001. It said the main factors contributing to the long economic expansion - investment, personal consumption and exports - would not hold up next year without such a cut in tax rates. ""Exports, already down in 1998, are expected to deteriorate further next year due to continued troubles in Asia, and a likely slowdown in Latin America,"" it said. Business investment would also slow as companies' profits came under pressure because they had little power to raise prices. Consumers, already dipping into investments to spend, would also retrench next year. The Fed's decision to hold rates unchanged, following the last meeting this year of the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, was expected and was to some extent signalled after the previous meeting in November. Then, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point for the third time in seven weeks in response, it said, to strains in the financial markets. Those market strains, which emerged after the Russian debt default in August, appear to have eased, and analysts were expecting the Fed to begin to focus on evidence of weakness in the real economy. In a separate forecast, Standard &Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said the economy would slow sharply in the first half of next year, growing annually at 1%. Growth would accelerate somewhat in the second half to give a 2% figure for the whole year, it said. Nonetheless, there remained a 40% chance that the economy would sink into recession in 1999 - though if it did, it would be a mild one, S&P said. It predicted the Fed would over the course of the year resume its interest rate reductions. The current Fed Funds rate of 4 3/4% would be cut to 4% by the year end, it said. David Blitzer, S&P's chief economist, said: ""Consumers have been the driving force for the economy, but they cannot keep increasing their spending twice as fast as their earnings. ""Other sectors of the economy - foreign trade, capital spending, government spending and housing - are not big enough or strong enough to replace the consumer as the growth engine.""

By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had clambered back above the 9,000-point level. Modest selling was seen ahead of the Federal open market committee meeting, which as expected left rates unchanged. US Treasuries were weaker, with the benchmark 30-year bond falling 25/32 to 102 3/32, yielding 5.112%. By early afternoon the Dow had gained 13.65 at 9,002.50, while the Standard &Poor's 500 index was down 1.15 to 1,201.69. Cyclical consumer shares were the main movers in the Dow, with Coca Cola up $1 1/2 to $67 1/4 and Procter &Gamble up $2 1/2 at $89 1/2. But Goodyear Tire, another Dow member, fell $1 15/16 to $50 3/8 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to a ""neutral"" rating from ""strong buy"". The Nasdaq composite was down 13.01 to 2,125.02 as major computer shares, ranging from Intel to Compaq Computer fell back, one day after Monday's rally sent the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to new record closes. Semiconductor shares fell back, with Cypress Semiconductor down $7/8 to $8 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to ""neutral"". In the networking computer sector Cabletron Systems lost $15/16 to $8 after the company reported quarterly results. Internet stocks continued higher, buoyed by online broker Ameritrade, which raised its outlook for quarterly earnings. Ameritrade shares shot up $10 1/8 to $31 1/8. Also bucking the tech trend was Apple Computer, which gained $1 7/8 to $36 15/16 on a report that its iMac computer was the best selling retail personal computer in November. In the healthcare sector, Cigna was $1 1/8 higher to $78 7/16 after the company confirmed it was in talks with Ace Limited. Southeby's rose $2 1/2 to $30 1/2 after Merrill Lynch raised its rating. TORONTO was mixed, but with a positive bias, at midsession as investors took profits following the gains of recent sessions. The TSE-300 composite index was 6.50 higher at 6,387.50 in volume of 37m shares. Analysts noted that weakness in the gold sector had tempered the market's performance during morning trade, while the oil and gas sector was also lower. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

41,2004-08-10,2004-08-11,Financial Times,US interest rates up by quarter point.,"The US Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 1.5 per cent yesterday, and gave no indication that recent weaker economic data would rein in its intention to tighten monetary policy at a measured pace. The policymaking Federal open market committee noted: ""In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labour market conditions has slowed."" In line with Congress testimony of Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, the statement said: ""This softness likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices. The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion."" The rest of the statement was unchanged from June's, with the Fed reiterating that, with underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, rates could be moved back towards a more neutral level ""at a pace likely to be measured"". The rate increase was expected despite weaker economic activity at the end of the second quarter and a weak July jobs report. Some Fed-watchers predicted the central bank would give itself greater flexibility in its guidance following Friday's announcement that US employers added only 32,000 jobs to payrolls in July. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 10 basis points to 2.54 per cent following the announcement and the 10-year yield rose 5 basis points to 4.3 per cent. The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent and the dollar strengthened. Futures contracts suggested investors raised the probability of a September rate increase from below 50 to above 70 per cent. The US labour department reported that productivity grew at a 2.9 per cent annual rate in the second quarter in the non-farm business sector, slower than the 3.7 per cent in the first quarter but above consensus expectations of a 2 per cent rate.

42,1994-08-16,1994-08-17,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FED RAISES DISCOUNT RATE.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday announced a 50 basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4% from 3.5%, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar's initial response was favourable, jumping from DM 1.5515 before the announcement to DM 1.5660 against the D-Mark. Traders reported a surge of interest in US Treasury bonds, which should help the dollar. New York trading finished with the US currency at DM 1.5615. The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, was favourably received by analysts, who described it as a 'healthy, decisive move'. The rate increase was the fifth this year by the Fed. It said in a statement that it expected its actions 'to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained non-inflationary growth'. The Federal Funds rate - the benchmark for US short-term rates - will rise to 4.75% from 4.25%. Ahead of the FOMC's announcement, which came at 17.17 GMT, currency trading across the board was fairly listless, with volumes low and currencies moving in fairly narrow ranges. The D-Mark was slightly easier as some investors took profits, anticipating a rise in US rates. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index unchanged all day at 78.8. Analysts welcomed both the extent of the Fed's move and the rhetoric accompanying it. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'This goes a long way to instilling credibility in the Fed both in terms of its actions and by its rhetoric.' He said the dollar had been given a good deal of support at the DM 1.55 level. Mr Stewart said the dollar would probably take its cue from the Treasury bond market, where the early outlook was encouraging with signs of foreign investors buying. Mr Stewart added that the Fed would be unlikely to move rates again before its November meeting. He is not predicting a further rise this year. But Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, predicted that the Fed Funds rate would probably rise to 5% this year, still a long way short of the 5.85% being discounted by the December Eurodollar contract. Ahead of the FOMC, activity in the interest rate futures markets was subdued. The December short sterling contract traded only 13,400 lots, but closed four basis points firmer at 93.23, helped by a lower than expected July public sector borrowing figure, and the CBI distributive trades survey showing that consumer spending remains patchy. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said the market was still 'far too gloomy' about the outlook for rates. He noted that at the beginning of the year, December short sterling reflected three-month interest rates at 4.4% by the end of 1994. This figure is now close to 6.8% - 'a massive turnaround by any standards'. Mr Parsons noted that, going back to 1989, three-month LIBOR, as implied from the futures market, had never closed more than 82 basis points above the base rate. But even if UK rates jump by 3/4 percentage point to 6%, the December contract is still nearly 80 basis points above this level. 'It is hard to see what will drive three-month rates to 6.8% by December,' said Mr Parsons. Ms Liz Ward, economist at Bank Julius Baer in London, makes a similar point, noting that on the March 1995 futures contract for sterling and D-Mark rates, the expected differential has widened from a low of 52 basis points in March to around 200 basis points now. Ms Ward said that while expectations of higher UK short-term rates should have boosted the pound, the reverse has occurred. 'The widening gap seems to have reflected market perceptions of a weaker pound ahead. The causation is flowing from the currency to interest rates, rather than vice versa.' She cited two other factors which explain the 6% fall in the pound against the D-Mark this year. One is that sterling has traded like a 'transatlantic' currency, following roughly half of the 6.7% move down in the dollar. The other is that 'exchange markets have ignored strong UK fundamentals for even stronger ones in Germany'. There also appears to be a belief that the German recovery is less likely than the UK one to foster inflation. Although purchasing power parity estimates suggest the pound is nearly 10% undervalued against the D-Mark, Ms Ward said it is difficult to make a case for buying pounds 'without a convincing move on base rates first'. Sterling finished at DM 2.3951 from DM 2.4061 and at $1.5401 from $1.5467. The Bank of England did not operate in the morning or afternoon rounds yesterday, providing UK money markets with only #90m late assistance after earlier forecasting a #350m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/2%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
43,1994-08-16,1994-08-17,Financial Times,FED 'STAYS WITH THE CURVE' ON INFLATION.,"But critics fear the interest rate increases might hamper economic growth, writes George Graham. The US Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to raise short term interest rates was almost universally expected, but the argument over whether this is the right step to take is not so one-sided. In its statement announcing an increase of half a percentage point in both the discount and federal funds rates, the Fed said it was acting 'against the background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilisation'. 'The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said. But administration officials and Democratic members of Congress are worried that the Fed might be too jittery about prices rises that are still scarcely visible to the naked eye: in its zeal to kill off inflation 18 months down the road, does it not risk killing off an already slowing economic recovery before its time? Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, were conciliatory yesterday in their joint statement. 'The administration recognises and respects the independence of the Federal Reserve to make decisions about the nation's monetary policies. We share a common goal with the Federal Reserve of sustained growth with low inflation,' they said. There is not much more the administration can do, except back the Fed's board with new appointees. That seems to be having little effect, for yesterday's vote was unanimous, despite the addition to the board of Mr Alan Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, two Clinton nominees. Democratic senators were more forthright in their criticism of the Fed's decision. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, called it unwise and Senator Paul Sarbanes, who will take over next year as chairman of the banking committee, urged the Fed to 'leave the economy alone'. 'The economy is doing pretty well but every time the Fed takes the rates up it dampens economic activity,' he said. Many business groups share this concern. But the financial markets side firmly with the Fed on the need to deal with brewing signs of inflation. Even an increase of a quarter of a percentage point yesterday would have been greeted with disappointment as a sign that the Fed was 'behind the curve' on inflation. The members of the Federal Open Market Committee are less godlike in their certitude than the markets. They appear to have taken to heart Oliver Cromwell's advice to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.' Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, put it a little differently last week in testimony to a congressional committee last week. 'Policy making requires an assessment of the consequences of various policy alternatives should they prove to be wrong. We must ask ourselves: how difficult would it be to reverse policy mistakes and at what cost?' The committee also includes five presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks. They stay in close touch with business leaders in their districts, and several of them have in recent weeks made a concerted effort to justify higher interest rates in speeches to community leaders and chambers of commerce. Fed officials say they have not been fully convinced by signs of an economic slowdown in some recent statistics, such as the large increase in business inventories in the second quarter, and argue that the capacity of the job market and industrial plant to absorb more demand is becoming stretched. The Fed said yesterday that its half point increase in rates was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth.' That probably averts the likelihood of further tightening at next month's committee meeting, but does not appear to rule out the possibility of another increase before the end of the year.

44,1994-08-16,1994-08-17,Financial Times,FED LIFTS SHORT-TERM RATES TO STEM INFLATION PRESSURE.,"Discount rate up half a point; US bonds and stocks rally; Banks increase loan costs. By GEORGE GRAHAM. The US Federal Reserve yesterday lifted short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year, adding half a percentage point in an effort to head off inflation rises. After a morning meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, the Fed announced that it was increasing the discount rate which it charges on money lent to the banking system to 4% from 3.5%. The Fed is also raising the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight balances, to 4.75% from 4.25%. Although an increase in rates had been widely expected, investors and dealers were unsure whether the Fed would raise rates by a quarter of a point or make the sharper adjustment that came yesterday. On Wall Street, the news triggered a surge in bond prices and brought solid gains to stocks. The markets had stumbled briefly in the minutes after the Fed's announcement, but quickly picked up forward momentum during the afternoon. Chase Manhattan raised its prime lending rate for its best business customers to 7.75% from 7.25% in the wake of the Fed move and other banks followed suit. White House officials have repeatedly said that they see no signs of inflation rises that would require a tightening of monetary policy, but add that the Fed is independent. 'Given the strong gains in output and employment so far this year, we need to be watchful for signs of developing price pressures,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura Tyson, White House chief economist, said in a joint statement yesterday. Democratic senators, however, were less sparing in their criticism. 'If you're bored down there at the Fed, if a rosy economic outlook makes you blue, get out of town, take a vacation, do any thing, but just don't raise those interest rates,' Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said before the Fed move. Fed officials note that they kept interest rates very low to try to boost sluggish recovery in 1992 and 1993. 'In fact, real short term rates - that is, adjusted for inflation - were around zero levels throughout last year,' Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said last week. Most recent economic data have suggested that the economy has slowed considerably, and is growing at a much steadier pace than the 3.7% annualised rate of the second quarter. However, July's employment statistics showed that job creation remained strong, and the producer price index, published last Thursday, showed a 0.5% bounce in wholesale prices last month. Fed officials say that policy actions only show their effects about one-and-a-half to two years later, and that they cannot be deterred by the apparently calm inflation indices. Some Fed economists argue that full employment is now reached when the unemployment rate stands at around 6% - very close to its current level. Any further drop in unemployment, they say, could lead to shortages of labour and be expected to provoke an acceleration in the inflation rate. After the early pause, prices on longer-dated Treasury bonds climbed nearly 1 1/2 points on the rate rise, even though most analysts had anticipated the Fed's course of action. Traders appeared reassured by the apparent resolve of the Fed's chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, to snuff out inflationary pressures. In the equity markets, the rate rise triggered a brief rally, but in minutes a 20-point gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average was converted into a 15-point loss. By the close, however, it was up 24.28 at 3,784.57. In Tokyo today, stocks opened firmer. The Bundesbank, which has a policy meeting tomorrow, is expected to let the dust settle after the Fed move. Economists see scope for a German discount rate cut, but believe the bank's 'steady hand' policy will prevail.

45,1994-08-16,1994-08-17,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"Stock index futures traded in a tight range as dealers waited for the outcome of discussions at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Confirmation of a rise in US interest rates came well after the market close, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,155 and languished in the first hour. The lower than expected PSBR figure cheered the market, sending the contract ahead to reach a peak of 3,169. However, a combination of profit-taking together with concerns that the FMOC would raise interest rates saw the contract give up the early gains. Following a bout of sideways trading over the lunchtime period, September again moved forward, this time encouraged by the firm opening on Wall Street. But the worries on interest rates remained, which brought another setback and September finished just ahead of the day's low at 3,153, a point ahead of its previous close and at a 5-point premium to cash. Volume at 6,766 lots remained low. Traded options stayed dull and total turnover was 22,268 lots. Two big trades in Hanson puts were the only outstanding feature in the stock options. They were said to have been carried out by Kleinwort Benson and Monument. Volume was 3,481. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
46,1994-08-16,1994-08-17,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - US RATE RISE DECISION TOO LATE TO AFFECT LONDON - MARKET REPORT.,"The London stock market was again preoccupied with watching for any signs of a precursor to a shift in US interest rates, eventually ending a tense but largely boring session marginally higher on balance. The FT-SE 100 Index settled with a net gain of 5.1 at 3,147.3, having moved in a narrow range throughout the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index delivered another uninspiring performance, closing 4.1 lower at 3,715.1. While dealers remained on alert for the rise in US rates, which could impact on the large number of UK stocks traded on Wall Street, the move of 50 basis points in the Fed Funds rate came two hours after London closed. The market began the trading session in subdued fashion with marketmakers lowering their opening prices in the wake of an eight-point fall on the Dow Industrial Average. The early decline proved short-lived, however, as a lower than expected public sector borrowing requirement number of #1.1bn, compared with a consensus figure up around #1.5bn, boosted gilt-edged stocks and produced a keen rally in the equity market. Gilts were also supported by the latest survey of disitributive trades published by the Confederation of British Industry which pointed to a slowing of retail sales, a move interpreted in the City as reducing the possibility of an early increase in UK interest rates. Down some three points at the outset, the FT-SE 100 moved into positive territory within the hour, gradually climbing to reach the day's high point of 3,151.6, up 9.4, shortly after Wall Street opened and while the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting was in progress. But with Wall Street faltering, before embarking on another good rise after London had closed, the UK market began to ease off. As well as having to contend with an expected rise in US interest rates, the market has to face a welter of domestic economic news this morning. This will include unemployment figures for July, average earnings and, most importantly, inflation numbers for last month. Some forecasters are looking for a negative inflation result month on month. Turnover yesterday came out at 511.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for around 57% of activity. The value of customer business on Monday was a slightly disappointing #1.145bn. Meanwhile, a buzz of excitement went around the trading desks in the late afternoon as dealers picked up whispers that a big FT-SE 100 bid could be in the offing. GEC was one name being bandied about as a potential bid target for one of the big conglomerates such as BTR or Hanson. This story was mostly dismissed by analysts, who pointed out that GEC was much more likely to emerge as a predator than a target. And traders again began to focus on the obvious benefits of a merger between British Aerospace and GEC, which have been involved in tentative merger talks in the past. There was heavy trading in GEC stock, with one leading UK broking house said to have bought the stock aggressively, while British Aerospace shares were being chased in the market. Marketmakers also pointed out that GEC was in a strong position to buy in its own shares. Another takeover candidate, according to the market, was Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, with Glaxo one name being mooted. The regional electricity stocks were also being viewed as potential takeover targets. Bank shares continued to attract switching, with HSBC again badly affected by worries of static underlying profits growth. Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered were the prime beneficiaries of the stories. Dealers pointed to Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley as brokers advising the switch.

FRANKFURT had its fun in the post bourse as the September bund future took a view on the Washington meeting, and jumped 44 basis points to 91.99 on the proposition that the Fed would impose a 50-point rate rise later in the US day, a forecast that was later confirmed. After a rise of just 4.30 to 2,143.14 in the Dax on the session, the post bourse saw an Ibis-indicated peak of 2,158.13 before it closed at 2,152.65. However, Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said there was little trading as investors bided their time ahead of the FOMC decision; short-covering, she added, took the Dax constituents up in the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM 5.1bn to DM 6.6bn. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, dropped DM 42.50 to DM 915 as it said that two of its drugs were under examination, and regained only DM 6 after hours after stating that neither were carcinogenic and calling a press conference for tomorrow morning to elaborate. Construction stocks were strong, Strabag rising DM 17.50 to DM 510.50 on a 20% increase in orders in the first half of 1994. In chemicals, BASF rose DM 4.90 to DM 327.20 as its Wintershall subsidiary forecast a profit from its gas operations in 1995, a year earlier than originally planned. AMSTERDAM recovered all of Monday's losses, helped by good gains in a number of the blue chips. The AEX index improved 1.89 to 417.07. Unilever rose Fl 3.10 to Fl 199.60, a number of brokers having issued positive reports following last week's results. Among them was James Capel, which reiterated its buy recommendation and remained optimistic about earnings per share growth during 1995 and 1996. Philips and KPN also saw buying strength as they announced plans to establish a joint venture, together with Graff Pay-Per-View, of the US, to provide a new media service in Europe. Philips put on 30 cents at Fl 58.20 and KPN added 70 cents at Fl 50.50. Hunter Douglas shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 83.70 as profits were taken following its better than expected results, while Wolters Kluwer added Fl 1.50 at Fl 120.50 after announcing a 23% gain in first-half profits and forecasting 20% growth over the full year. MILAN returned after Monday's holiday and continued to monitor the political temperature, following last week's unexpected rise in interest rates and a weekend of meetings between coalition partners in Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. The Comit index closed 9.72 higher at 654.15. Analysts expect the nervousness to continue, with the 1995 budget due to be presented to parliament before September 30. Among individual performances, Fiat advanced L35 to L6,385, Benetton rose L650 to L22,450 and Olivetti L75 to L2,195. ZURICH took the Frankfurt line on FOMC prospects and the SMI index rose 18.1 to 2,588.7. Roche certificates and Nestle were the most active stocks, with gains either side of 1%. In banks, UBS recovered with a rise of SwFr 25 to SwFr 1,112, and SBC bearers rose SwFr 3 to SwFr 397 ahead of results which arrived after hours. However, analysts flinched when they saw the figures, which included a 63% drop in first-half trading income, and said that the shares would tumble today. MADRID fell against the trend, the general index losing 1.71 at 311.18. Bonds were slightly firmer but most banks were down, with BBV off Pta45 at Pta3,040 and BCH Pta80 at Pta2,665. ADR stocks such as Endesa, Pta50 lower at Pta6,010, and Repsol, down Pta95 at Pta3,930, became less attractive as Wall Street lost its impetus late in the European day. PARIS drifted higher in a session that was characterised by a lack of corporate news. The CAC-40 index improved 5.40 to 2,012.35 in thin turnover of about FFr 2bn. STOCKHOLM staged a modest recovery as the market reversed three days of losses. Ericsson, the telecommunications group, provided the main support for the market, but shares in the forestry sector were also strong. The Affarsvarlden general index was little changed, down 0.3 at 1,400.3, in moderate turnover of SKr2.2bn. Ericsson B shares rose SKr4 to SKr393 ahead of tomorrow's six-month figures, while Electrolux lost SKr3 at SKr368 in spite of reporting an improvement in half-year results. TEL AVIV fell another 2%, the Mishtanim index closing 3.74 lower at 183.40 after the Israeli finance minister Mr Avraham Shohat said Israel's 1994 inflation rate would be double digit, revising an official forecast of 8%. Mr Shohat had more news for the market after hours when he proposed a capital gains tax on share profits, specifically a 10% tax on real profits from share investments. He said that the market would be closed on Wednesday and Thursday to ease the way for his recommendation. Written and edited by William Cochrane and John Pitt (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
48,2009-06-24,2009-06-25,Financial Times,Consensus reflects easing and rates trade-off,"No plans to expand asset purchases 'Output gap' guards against inflation The Federal Reserve is on hold - but it expects quite a long time to pass before it starts raising interest rates again. That is the basic message from yesterday's statement. The central bank did not increase its planned asset purchases, which amounts to no additional easing. However, it simultaneously rebuffed market expectations of early rate increases. The Fed said it ""continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period"". It noted that ""prices of energy and other commodities have risen"" and importantly dropped a reference to deflation risk. But it said ""substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures"" and added that it ""expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time"". These last three words were new and reinforce the message. This reflects the view of Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Don Kohn, Fed vice-chairman, that a large and growing output gap between demand and potential supply provides a strong safeguard against inflation. The decision was unanimous, with more hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee apparently accepting the guidance on interest rates in return for no increase in Treasury purchases. The central bank said it would continue to evaluate the ""timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities"" - leaving open the possibility that it could still adjust its Treasury -purchase plan at or before its next meeting. ""I think there is still a good chance that in order to avoid the cliff edge effect they will stretch it out and may change the mix between Treasuries and mortgages,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. But the lack of any clear signal on this in the statement suggests the Fed is not predisposed to expand the Treasury programme and might simply complete it as scheduled in September. Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities said: ""They are delivering more or less the promised degree of stimulus, in the context of an economy where the news is improving and rates are backing up."" The Fed did say it would ""make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programmes as warranted"". One interpretation of this phrase is that the Fed wants to retain flexibility to tweak its programmes even if the overall stance of policy is hold. Another is that this was an oblique reference to the gradual phasing out of some programmes as market conditions improve. There was no explicit reference to exit strategy. The US central bank marked up its assessment of current economic conditions, but did not radically reappraise its economic -outlook. It said the pace of the recession was ""slowing"" and said conditions in financial markets ""have generally improved"". There were ""further signs of -stabilising"" household spending, while businesses ""appear to be making progress"" on inventories. However, the Fed said household spending ""remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit"" while business were ""cutting back on fixed investment and staffing"". It reiterated its cautious view that ""economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time"". While the immediate market response was to sell Treasuries and push up yields, on the grounds that the Fed was not buying any more of them, Bill Gross, founder of Pimco, told CNBC he was surprised by this response and thought yields on short-term securities should trade lower on the statement."
49,2009-06-24,2009-06-25,Financial Times,Oracle sets positive tone for blue chips despite mixed data,"wall street US stocks bounced yesterday morning as Oracle boosted the technology sector and investors focused on the positives in a mixed bag of economic data. The software maker helped the technology sector top the benchmark S&P 500 index after reporting sales and profit that were better than Wall Street had expected. Its shares gained 8.7 per cent to $21.60. Two of Oracle's biggest rivals also felt the benefit with Microsoft rising 1.2 per cent to $23.63 and IBM up 1.3 per cent at $105.83. On a busy day for economic data, the markets were reassured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which upgraded its forecasts for US growth for 2009 and 2010. The OECD's 2009 forecast is now slightly better than that from the World Bank, whose downgrade of its forecast on Monday helped trigger that day's sell-off. Stocks were given added impetus by figures showing that durable goods orders unexpectedly rose during May. Lower demand for cars had been expected to drag the number lower and the figures helped Ford climb 5.3 per cent to $5.83. Meanwhile, materials producers and industrial companies performed well. Metals stocks continued Tuesday's recovery following a sharp sell-off on Monday, boosted by the durable goods numbers and higher commodity prices. Alcoa , which produces aluminium, rose 4.9 per cent to $10.49 while Free-port McMoRan , the copper miner, which was upgraded by Friedman Billings Ramsey, picked up 6.4 per cent to $50.20. AK Steel advanced 5.5 per cent to $18.65 and Caterpillar , which makes machinery for the mining industry, was 3.6 per cent higher at $34.17. The materials sector was initially given an extra boost by results from Monsanto , the agricultural giant, which beat estimates with its quarterly earnings. But the shares fell 1.5 per cent to $78.15 after the company said gross profit from its Roundup herbicide would fall roughly 50 per cent because of increased competition. The markets dipped in early trade after figures were released showing that new home sales unexpectedly fell in May but stocks then quickly recovered. ""The fact that the market completely shrugged off the new home sales data had me stunned,"" said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. ""But technology and materials stocks seem to be providing support right now."" By midday, the benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.5 per cent to 908.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 8,396.90 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 2.2 per cent to 1,803.72. Many on Wall Street remained cautious ahead of the end of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, however, with investors looking for signals on when the Federal Reserve might implement an exit strategy from its stimulus programme. Financial stocks were higher after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week as interest rates dropped from recent levels. They then continued to climb in spite of suffering a brief dip on the new home sales data. By midday, Wells Fargo , which Citi said yesterday would see sufficient business in its mortgage department to give it strong second-quarter results, was 1.4 higher at $23.22. Citigroup also picked up ground, helped by the news that it intends to increase employees' base salaries in 2009 as part of an effort to retain top talent. Its shares climbed 1.3 per cent to $3.05. Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants , which owns several leading US mid-market chains, including Olive Garden and Red Lobster, also beat estimates with its earnings but its shares fell as the company warned 2010 would not be as good a year as hoped. The stock lost 1.9 per cent to $32.39. There was more bad news from the supermarket chain SuperValu , which warned lower customer spending would see quarterly results come in substantially below analysts' predictions. The stock fell 11.9 per cent to $13.83 and the words also had an effect on its rival Kroger , which reported lower quarterly revenues than expected on Tuesday. Kroger's shares lost 1.2 per cent to $21.51."
50,2009-06-24,2009-06-25,Financial Times,Dramatic action from Europe's central bank,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Libor falls after ECB injects €442bn Fed likely to play down rate rises Central banks dominated financial market action yesterday as the ECB lent record funds to eurozone banks, the Swiss National Bank moved to weaken the franc and investors awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The European Central Bank pumped €442bn ($617bn) into the banking system at a rate of 1 per cent in its first-ever offer of one-year funds - more than analysts had expected. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an executive of the ECB's executive board, said that banks must now lend on the funds they had borrowed. In the money markets , the three-month euro Libor rate fell 2.6 basis points to a record low of 1.185 per cent. ""My gut feeling is that all the spare cash flushing around now will drive yields still lower for the next week or two,"" said Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. ""If I had to make a guess, I could well see three-month money 25bp-50bp cheaper by mid-July, which would be about the easing the ECB probably is looking for."" But Christoph Rieger at Commerzbank warned that the excess liquidity posed new challenges for markets and the ECB. ""The amounts involved are so huge that the ECB may not be able to sit on its hands and leave the market to itself."" Mr Rieger added that ""inactivity would . . . leave overnight rates pinned significantly below the ECB's main policy rate for quite some time and, more importantly, money market functioning could be impaired with so much excess reserves in the system."" The ECB's move drove the euro lower against the dollar and pushed up short-dated European government bonds. On the currency markets , the euro dipped 0.3 per cent against the dollar and 0.7 per cent against sterling. But it rose sharply against the Swiss franc after the Swiss National Bank again stepped into the markets to drive its currency lower in a bid to protect Switzerland's manufacturing sector. The dollar was softer against most higher-yielding currencies as investors awaited the outcome of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve. The US central bank was widely expected to play down market expectations of an early rise in interest rates. ""The Federal Open market Committee is expected to reiterate its commitment to keeping policy rates low for an 'extended period',"" said David Greenlaw, Morgan Stanley's chief US fixed income economist, although he added: ""We doubt that the Fed will cite a particular date."" Uncertainty ahead of the Fed's post-meeting comments and fresh concerns about forthcoming supply put pressure on US government bonds . The yield on the 10-year Treasury was up 4bp at 3.67 per cent and the 30-year was 7bp higher at 4.43 per cent. By contrast, the two-year German Schatz yield fell 8bp to 1.41 per cent following the ECB's action and a gloomy assessment of the eurozone's prospects from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. ""The new OECD forecasts still see the eurozone as an underperformer, with a contraction in real GDP of nearly 5 per cent this year followed by stagnation next year - signalling the need for the ECB to exhaust the remaining scope for interest rate cuts sooner rather than later,"" said Marco Annunziata, UniCredit's chief economist. However, the OECD was more upbeat about the global outlook, saying the prospects for economic recovery next year had improved for the first time in two years. The comments, along with robust US durable goods data and strong earnings from software group Oracle, provided a more solid backdrop for equity markets. Investors largely shrugged off disappointing home sales figures. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.5 per cent, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 2.4 per cent and the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rose 0.4 per cent. In commodities , oil inched higher but failed to regain the $70 a barrel level as weekly US data showed a big drop in crude stockpiles. Copper's push back above $5,000 a tonne led a broad advance in base metals as sentiment was lifted by hopes of increased demand. Gold edged ahead as news from the Fed was awaited."
51,2009-06-24,2009-06-25,Financial Times (FT.Com),Won and yen retreat on recovery fears,"Asian currencies retreated on Thursday on growing fears that the region's economic recovery would lag behind that of the US. On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee meeting delivered the expected result - no change in US monetary policy and a toning down in inflation expectations - leaving investors with a clearer message that policy measures would not be withdrawn in the near future. The Fed was also slightly more upbeat on growth prospects, noting that the pace of contraction in the economy was slowing. This was in contrast to the picture developing in South Korea, where, in spite of an upward revision to the government's economic outlook for this year, exports continued to fall while domestic spending weakened. ""The recovery of private domestic demand will probably remain gradual as the debt burden of household and corporate sectors persists,"" said Suktae Oh at Citigroup. ""Export growth is likely to slow as the recent strength, driven by inventory restocking, should be limited by the limited recovery in final demand."" By midday in New York, the Korean won had fallen 0.7 per cent against the dollar, to Won1,258.10, and was 0.3 per cent lower against the yen to Won13.3670. Elsewhere, the yen was down across the board on fears that the rising risk of lower prices will keep the Bank of Japan hamstrung long after other central banks have started removing their accommodative policy measures. Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank said: ""Today's Japanese inflation data are likely to show ongoing rising deflation risks, and this trend should continue, supporting our view that the yen will weaken further in the months to come."" Meanwhile, the latest portfolio flow data showed Japanese investors were heavy buyers of foreign bonds. The yen fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar to Y96.13 and was down 0.4 per cent versus the euro to Y133.89. The dollar edged 0.1 per cent lower to $1.3920 against the euro. The Swiss franc remained on the back foot after Wednesday's intervention by Swiss monetary authorities to weaken the currency. It was down 0.1 per cent against the euro to SFr1.5308 and was 0.2 per cent weaker against the dollar at SFr1.0994. Sterling was weighed down by comments on Wednesday from Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, describing Britain's road to economic recovery as ""a long, hard slog"". The pound fell 0.8 per cent against the dollar to $1.6276 and was down 0.9 per cent to £0.8550 against the euro."
52,2009-06-24,2009-06-25,Financial Times (FT.Com),US economy contracts by revised 5.5%,"The US economy continued to contract in the first quarter of this year, but at a slower pace than previously thought, official figures showed on Thursday. Separately, the labour department said that new claims for unemployment benefits grew more than expected last week, offering a stark reminder that even as the economy turns around the stricken labour market could be slow to follow. Revised commerce department figures revealed that US gross domestic product declined by an annualised rate of 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year. That was better than economists expected and a smaller contraction than the original estimate of a 6.1 per cent contraction and last month's estimate of a 5.7 per cent decline. Output is slowly beginning to rekindle in the US economy, which has been mired in its worst recession in the last 50 years. The first quarter result, while grim, was an improvement from the end of 2008 when GDP declined by 6.3 per cent, the steepest fall since 1982. Economists expect to see more significant improvement in the second quarter of this year. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve said in its Federal Open Market Committee statement that economy activity was likely ""remain weak for a time"" but that sustainable economic growth would then resume gradually while inflation remains ""subdued"". Meanwhile the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development improved its outlook for the US and predicted the economy would grow by 0.9 per cent next year. Housing and manufacturing have shown signs of life lately. Home prices and sales have begun to stabilise in some areas and businesses have begun to ramp up their capital investment with more orders for durable goods. However, analysts fear that rising joblessness could slow the recovery. The labour department said on Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 15,000 to 627,000 last week. That was more than expected and boosted the four-week average to 617,250. The number of Americans continuing to claim unemployment benefits rose in the second week of the month to 6.74m, up from 6.71m the prior week. ""With initial claims still very high at above 600,000, it is unlikely that new hiring has picked up in any meaningful fashion,"" said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. ""More probable is that long-term unemployed are starting to fall off the rolls as the duration of their unemployment benefits reaches the statutory limit."" The US unemployment rate rose to 9.4 per cent last month and is expected to climb to 9.6 per cent in June."
53,2009-06-24,2009-06-25,Financial Times (FT.Com),Capital raising rumour hits Crédit Agricole,"Crédit Agricole shares fell on Thursday amid market rumours that the bank was looking at a possible capital raising. Traders said the rumour was making its way around the market and was not surprising, but had not been confirmed. Shares in the French bank lost 3.8 per cent to €9.15. CA shares were also hit by concerns over the profit outlook for the French bank. Kepler Capital Markets cut its rating to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and lowered the 2009 profit estimate for 2009 to €945m from €1.92bn. Kepler noted that that it expects additional losses from Emporiki, the heavily indebted Greek bank in which Crédit Agricole has a 72 per cent stake. In the wider market, European bourses were lower, with the Federal Reserve's comments on Wednesday evening leading investors to look ahead to the US central bank's ""exit strategy"" and a withdrawal of market stimulus measures. The Fed did not change interest rate levels and did not expand its planned asset purchases. Ed McKelvey at Goldman Sachs noted several aspects of the FOMC statement that were more hawkish than expected. ""The committee is less worried about extreme downside risks than it was in late April and therefore less inclined to take further steps toward accommodation,"" he said. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.1 per cent to 844.00. France's CAC 40 index lost 1.1 per cent to 3,150.74 and Germany's Xetra Dax was down 1.2 per cent to 4,777.91. European markets have been quite volatile all week, hits their lows on Tuesday. Resource shares negated some of Wednesday's gains as sentiment evolved, steelmaker ArcelorMittal fell 2.7 per cent to €23.07, Norsk Hydro lost 1.6 per cent to NKr34.05 and Eramet was 1.4 per cent lower at €183.00. Elsewhere, Porsche shares were some of the strongest of morning trading gaining 4.6 per cent to €45.09 following a late afternoon surge in the previous session. Share prices were boosted by rumours that the debt-ridden sportscar maker was nearing a deal to sell its Volkswagen stake to Qatar. Volkswagen shares fell 0.7 per cent to €248.69 after gaining 11.7 per cent in the previous session. Telecom Italia shares rose 3.5 per cent to €0.98 after positive analyst comments. Goldman Sachs said: ""We expect Telecom Italia to outperform peers as accelerating cost reduction activities, an improving domestic competitive environment and a successful turnaround at TIM Brasil increase confidence."" Bouygues announced it had signed a contract to design and built a new deep-water port in Tangier. The contract will be worth €335m to Bouygues, with the work estimated to take around four and a half years. Goldman Sachs upgraded the French construction conglomerate to ""buy"" from ""neutral"", and its shares were lifted 3.6 per cent to €27.62. Swedish clothing company Hennes & Mauritz reported a 6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the second quarter, compared to the same period a year earlier. Europe's second-largest clothing retailer's stock was 1.5 per cent higher at SKr376.00, but Alessandra Coppola, equity analyst at S&P, reiterated a ""sell"" recommendation. ""May sales disappointed at -9 per cent year-on-year, in line with our expectations but missing consensus (-8 per cent) and indicating an unsupportive trading environment,"" she said in a note."
54,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,An open commitment - A call for more transparency in British monetary management.,"An open commitment - Gordon Pepper and Anthony Harris call for more transparency in British monetary management. The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy i n public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank. We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made formally independent.

55,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,Government Bonds - Sterling's rally encourages short and medium gilts.,"A rally in sterling lifted prices in the short and medium-dated gilts, though the long end of the market remained in the doldrums. Dealers said yesterday's improvement was partly a technical correction after the market was oversold on Monday. Trading conditions proved volatile yesterday, with the long gilt future opening up 11/32 at 95.16, before falling back to close at 94.30. But the shorter end of the market performed well, recording gains of as much as 3/8 point. 'Sterling holds the key at the moment,' said Mr Phillip Tyson, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. The improvement in sterling revived hopes that a further reduction in interest rates would be possible sooner rather than later. The short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange gained 6 basis points to close at 91.75. However, dealers expected trading conditions to remain volatile at least until firm details of the government's economic policy emerge following sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. The market will listen keenly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech tomorrow for hints of the form the new economic policy will take. High-yielding European bond markets continued their meteoric fall yesterday. Italian government bonds shed 1 1/2 points, as the lira dived yesterday morning, but recovered some ground later in the day. Spanish bonds fared poorly, recording losses of 1 3/8 points. Non-resident selling pressure pushed prices down further, as fears of a peseta devaluation and worries about the lifting of capital controls depressed sentiment further. Dealers said liquidity in the Spanish bond market was particularly poor. GERMAN bund prices were forced to surrender some of the gains that they made on Monday, ending 1/4 point lower. Dealers said the market had got ahead of itself, but sentiment remained positive. The new 10-year 7 1/4% bund issue met firm demand, dealers said. The results are due to be announced today. Although the rush of buying seen on Monday appeared to have dried up, German bunds are expected to retain their safe haven status, since economic fundamentals remain favourable. The German bund future on Liffe closed at 91.38, down from Monday's close of 91.70. DUTCH bonds fell back after their opening rise, following a steep fall in German bund futures. Dealers said bond prices had gone too high and fell back as stock market turbulence faded. An increased supply from tap issue had also brought prices down, dealers said. BELGIUM will issue a new state loan aimed at private investors between November 12 and November 18, the Belgian Finance Ministry said, Reuter reports from Brussels. The maturity, coupon and issue price will be set later. The previous state loan in June raised BFr 58.5bn and one in February brought in BFr 66bn. FRENCH bond prices fell a further half point yesterday, as benefits from the fall in stock prices on Monday evaporated. Dealers said the concerns of currency weakness continued to preoccupy the market. The OAT future on the Matif ended 0.58 point down at 108.56. JAPANESE bonds again performed inversely to the stock market, gaining ground during early stock market weakness, then falling back when equity prices rallied later in the day. The JGB future on Liffe ended unchanged at 106.87, in thin trade. LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on disappointment that the Federal Reserve's monthly federal open market committee (FOMC), which met during the day, did not ease monetary policy to help the ailing economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 13/16 at 98, yielding 7.411%. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/8 at 100 17/32 to carry a yield of 3.735%. In the absence of economic news, the market's attention was focused on yesterday's FOMC meeting. Speculation has mounted in recent days that the FOMC would sanction another cut in interest rates (possibly a 25 basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate and a 50 basis-point reduction in the discount rate) to lift the apparently stalled economic recovery. A policy ease has been partly discounted by the market, and the lack of a move from the Fed yesterday meant that some of those gains had to be given back. The Financial Times.

56,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America) - Dow supported by hopes of a rate cut.,"Wall Street US markets settled down with share prices holding their ground amid mounting speculation about a possible interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.81 at 3,178.19, the index having spent all but the first few minutes of the day only a few points either side of Monday's close.

59,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,An open commitment: A call for more transparency in British monetary management,"The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy in public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank. We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made formally independent.

60,1995-05-23,1995-05-24,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - JUPPE SPEECH KEEPS FRENCH FRANC IN SPOTLIGHT.,"The French franc remained the focus of attention yesterday as the market responded sceptically to a policy speech by Mr Alain Juppe, the new prime minister, writes Philip Gawith. Plans to tackle unemployment and raise the minimum wage were not well received and the franc lost ground, closing in London at FFr 3.559 per D-Mark, from FFr 3.542. The D-Mark was a general beneficiary of franc weakness, and made gains against most European crosses. It was also firmer against the dollar. Traders did report buying interest when the dollar dipped, an indication of the positive sentiment in the market. This was reinforced by lack of enthusiasm for taking the currency decisively lower. The dollar finished mildly down at DM 1.4362, from DM 1.4482. Against the yen it closed at Y 87.025 from Y 87.715. Opinion ahead of the FOMC meeting was practically unanimous that no change in policy should be expected. In New York the US currency ended at DM 1.4440 and Y 87.175. Sterling had little fresh news to chew on. It lost ground against the firmer D-Mark to close at DM 2.2563, from DM 2.2695. Against the dollar it finished at $1.5711 from $1.5672. The effect of Mr Juppe's speech was to confirm the market's worst expectations about a slide from economic rigour under the new government. Potential spending commitments were mentioned, without any compensating comments about deficit management. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said: 'I think it is going to be very hard for the new government to square the circle. The market senses that the one of those three objectives (cutting the deficit, cutting unemployment, and keeping the franc stable) the government is going to be less committed to than before is keeping the exchange rate strong.' Mr Persaud said the prospect of the franc revisiting FFr 3.60 could not be ruled out, but he did not think it would go to FFr 3.90, the upper limit of the EMS band. 'I do not think the Bundesbank will allow it to reach FFr 3.90,' he said. 'Above FFr 3.60 it becomes not just a French problem, but a German problem.' The main reason to cut rates again would be to alleviate the pressures German industry is feeling from a strong D-Mark. Mr Frank Newman, the US deputy treasury secretary, told the OECD gathering in Paris the perception that the US was trying to talk down the dollar was 'absolutely unfounded'. He also said that he saw the overall US trade deficit declining over time. Some economists believe a good US trade performance will be the catalyst for a dollar rally, making people happier to hold dollars, and increasing the prospect of higher US interest rates. Mr Toyoo Gyoten, a special adviser to Japan's Ministry of Finance, said the recent 'erratic' phase of the yen's rise appeared to be over. He forecast that it would trade in a fairly narrow range of about Y 85 to Y 90 to the dollar. He predicted that currencies would be discussed at the G7 summit in Halifax, but doubted whether any concerted action would result. 'They know the problem, they have a desire to cope with the problem and solve it, but I do not think they are collectively quite ready to launch some very concrete steps,' he said. Mr Gyoten acknowledged that Japan itself had not done enough to affect the fundamental economic change necessary. The Iranian government's attempts to peg the value of the rial at 3,000 rials to the dollar have met with a sceptical reception. The new regulations, which ban all dealings above the rate of 3,000 rials, were announced after the currency lost a third of its value in two weeks. Reports from Tehran indicate that little trade was being conducted, with market participants waiting to see how the new system settles down. Expectations are that the repo rate will stay at 4.51% in today's variable rate auction in Germany. The Bundesbank will not want to raise expectations of a move in official rates, by allowing a sharp drop in the repo, when it is not yet prepared for a follow-up. The Bank of England, in its daily operations, cleared a #550m shortage at established rates. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 19/32%, from 6%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
61,1995-05-23,1995-05-24,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - FT-SE FAILS IN LATEST ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE 3,300 - MARKET REPORT.","The FT-SE 100-share Index just failed in its attempt to move back up through the 3,300 level. However, it survived a number of determined attempts by marketmakers and futures traders to get the market sharply lower. Once again it was Wall Street that came to the market's rescue. The Dow Average moved effortlessly back above the 4,400 mark shortly after it opened, with barely a ripple of unease about the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Earlier, in what was said by marketmakers to have been an awkward trading session, share prices had come off sharply in the wake of poor preliminary results from Marks and Spencer, the UK's premier high street retailer and one of the world's top-rated companies. They also reacted to stricter than expected rules on cross-media ownership. The latter drove shares in many of the recently buoyant television companies sharply lower, while boosting some of the radio company stocks. Bolstered by Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 settled a net 7.3 firmer at 3,291.8. Second-line stocks fared less well, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index never looking likely to emulate the 100 index and finally ending the session only 1.1 points firmer at 3,605.7. The Mid 250 index was restrained by a dismal performance from the leading housebuilders, which provided the three poorest performers in Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Taylor Woodrow. They were badly affected by a television programme on Monday evening which predicted falling house prices in real terms in coming years. There were no problems for the market at the outset of trading after Wall Street once again had confounded the bears and jumped 54 points. Marketmakers lifted their opening prices and the FT-SE 100 had improved some 11 points shortly after trading commenced. The early strength was quickly dissipated, however, by the disappointing numbers from Marks and Spencer which confirmed the difficult trading conditions in the UK's high streets outlined last week by WH Smith. It was another dismal trading session for the retailing sector, with GUS taking the dubious honour of worst performer in the FT-SE 100 Index, followed by Boots in second place and M&S in fourth. The VSEL/GEC/BAe takeover saga, which has rumbled on since last year, took a series of twists as early reports that GEC would be prevented from continuing its bid for the submarine manufacturer were shot down by news that the Department of Trade and Industry had allowed both bids to proceed. With the bid now set to be contested in the market place, VSEL shares, sharply lower first thing, subsequently shot up to approach the level of the BAe offer, around #18 a share. After the Dow moved ahead strongly in the late afternoon, the Footsie ended in good heart. Nevertheless, senior dealers do not expect many fireworks for the rest of the week as most European markets are closed for the Ascension Day holiday. Turnover was 671.9m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 63% of the total. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
62,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,OVERSEAS NEWS - TREASURIES STEADY AFTER FOMC MEETING.,"US Treasury prices were relatively steady at lower levels after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged after yesterday's meeting. Few had expected the Fed to lower interest rates after the surprisingly strong figures on February employment were released earlier this month. Treasury prices were lower as the Fed began its meeting at 8am and held at those levels after the FOMC meeting ended. But prices dipped later after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, told a senate panel that the economy was moving 'at a reasonably good clip'. Mr Greenspan, who was nominated by President Clinton to a third term at the Fed, testified before the Senate Banking Committee as part of the confirmation process. In early afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 5/16 lower at 92 3/32 to yield 6.604%, and the two-year note was down 1/16 at 98 15/16, yielding 5.696%. Yesterday's losses came despite a new indication that consumer spending is not likely to spur economic growth in the near term. At mid-morning, the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence slipped to 97.7 in March from 98 in February. Most economists had expected the figure to rise modestly to about 99. 'Although consumer attitudes, on balance, are pretty much in neutral territory, the uneasiness about the job market, coupled with concerns about future levels of income, do not suggest consumers are ready to spend more freely,' the Conference Board said. * Italy provided the focus for attention in Europe, with activity sparked by the suspension of the shares of Banco di Napoli and worries about the cost to the government of recapitalising the bank. On Liffe, Mr Alex Cooper, floor manager with Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, said many traders, who last week bought Italian bonds in the wake of consolidation in Europe and the US, moved quickly to reduce their exposures. As a result, volumes on Liffe were buoyant, with 52,510 contracts exchanged. The June future settled at 107.94, down just over a point. In the cash market, the 10-year yield spread over bunds widened to 448 basis points from 427 points on Monday. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the 'likely size of any recapitalisation is not huge but it has spooked BTPs nevertheless, catching the market on the defensive'. * Other European high-yielders had a mixed day. Spanish bonds closed marginally higher, with the 10-year yield spread over Germany falling from 333 basis points to 331 points. Swedish bonds closed lower, with the 10-year spread over bunds widening to 209 basis points. The Riksbank's cut in the securities repurchase rate from 7.6% to 7.4%, the seventh this year, had been expected. * Fears about the cost of BSE - so-called 'mad cow disease' - continued to overhang UK government bonds, which again underperformed other European markets. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'There has been a real change of investor perception. BSE is the overriding factor in the market just now.' Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds rose by 5 basis points, with the yield spread over bunds, which had narrowed to 178 basis points on Monday, widening to 185 points. Yields on benchmark two-year paper closed 7 basis points higher. On Liffe, June long gilts closed at 104 7/8, down 3/8. * German bonds closed largely unchanged, with yields falling marginally on 10-year bunds and most shorter-dated paper. The market slipped in early trading, following indications from the Bundesbank that an immediate cut in short-term rates was not on the cards, but later recovered ground. On Liffe, 10-year June futures settled at 96.44, down 0.01. * French figures for household consumption in February were as expected and OATs largely tracked bunds. The 10-year yield spread widened by 2 basis points to 23 points. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
63,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,MARKETS - POLITICAL PRESSURES WEIGH HEAVILY ON EQUITIES - MARKET REPORT.,"By STEVE THOMPSON, UK Stock Market editor. The political fall-out from the mad cow disease controversy continued to cast a shadow over UK equities and was said to have been responsible for another dismal performance by the stock market. With dealers increasingly taking the view that the government will struggle to recover from the political and potential economic impact of the BSE scare, gilts were persistently sold throughout the day and the Footsie future traded at a big discount to the cash market. And some of the market's bears were casting doubts about today's auction of #3bn of five-year gilts. The 10-year gilt closed off the day's low but was still 12 ticks down at the close. The 20-year gilt was 14 ticks easier. The outcome of a difficult trading session in London was that the FT-SE 100 index once again waved goodbye to the 3,700 level. By the close, it was left nursing a 21.0 fall at 3,660.9. There was much less pressure on the second-line stocks, where another outstanding performance by Securicor, a further 11% stronger following Monday's restructuring proposals, helped sustain the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which ended 2.0 off at 4,294.5. Wall Street gave precious little support to London, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average coming in on the weak side and falling sharply in the first 30 minutes of trading before staging a good rally and posting a small gain soon after that. Late in the session there was news that the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting had finished and that US interest rates had been left unchanged. Commenting on the day's events, the head trader at one of the leading UK securities houses said the institutions were worried about the political implications of the BSE scare. 'The feeling is that the government is in real trouble and that things will probably get much worse before they get better,' he said. He added that London was being propped up by Wall Street and that any big setback in New York, together with more bad news on the BSE front, could produce a nasty few days for UK stocks. Last week's burst of programme trading activity had also left the market heavy of certain stocks and caused considerable indigestion, he said. On the plus side, however, the view in the market was that the FT-SE 100 index was being depressed by a large short position in the future which, if unwound, might produce a sharp rebound. It was not all doom and gloom in the market. Glaxo Wellcome shot to the top of the FT-SE 100 leader board, in the wake of a burst of speculative buying triggered by the emergence of rumours that a merger between the company and Pfizer, of the US, could be on the cards. Most traders, although keen to take advantage of the big two-way business unleashed by the rumours, were unconvinced that such a deal was imminent. Turnover at 6pm came out at 822.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks providing 61% of the business. Customer activity on Monday was valued at #1.59bn. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
64,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,MARKETS - CURRENCIES QUIET AS MARKETS WAIT ON FED MEETING - MARKETS REPORT.,"Currency markets had a quiet day yesterday with traders mostly content to stay on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve policy meeting. The dollar closed little changed in London at DM 1.4758, from DM 1.4777, while the Fed was still meeting. Against the yen it closed at Y 106.245 from Y 106.13. The dollar firmed slightly when it emerged that the Fed had left interest rates on hold. The announcement did not come as a surprise. While many observers believe US rates will still fall further, the chance of an early cut was reduced by the freak US payrolls report last month. On the policy front, the Swedish central bank cut the repo rate to 7.4% from 7.6%, the seventh reduction of its central money market tender rate this year. In Europe the D-Mark finished slightly firmer against most currencies. The lira was the main loser, finishing at L1,064 from L1,055. Traders sold the currency after news emerged that shares in the state-controlled Banco di Napoli had been suspended. Sterling was stable, but there remain concerns that the government will pay a heavy political price for its handling of the 'mad-cow' scare. It closed at DM 2.2463, from DM 2.2536. Against the dollar it closed at $1.5222, from $1.5252. * Although the D-Mark had a slightly firmer tone yesterday, many analysts believe the outlook for the German currency is bleak. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW in London, said 'quite a bearish story' was developing for the D-Mark. He cited three recent developments: M3 growth, the regional elections and the IFO business confidence survey. With M3 money supply growth running at six per cent year on year, Mr Turner said the necessary condition for currency depreciation - money supply growth outstripping nominal output growth - was now in place. The election result, meanwhile, said Mr Turner, 'gave Chancellor Kohl the green light to press on with EMU.' He said this was likely to be negative for the D-Mark on fears of dilution when it becomes part of a single currency. Also, with the EMU project requiring a tight fiscal policy, this would need to be countered by an environment of low interest rates. The IFO survey revealed a big drop in exporter optimism, to the lowest level since last June. Mr Turner said this was probably a lagged response to the D-Mark's large appreciation against the yen in the second half of 1995. The D-Mark has also been the subject of pessimistic comment from Robert Fleming Securities. Peter Warburton and Paul Brunker note that for 20 years the D-Mark's reputation as a dependable store of wealth 'increased in parallel with the 2.9% per annum average gain in its trade-weighted index.' Progress has been so consistent that 'it is 15 years since the D-Mark index last dropped by as much as 3% below its last year average.' But they believe there are three reasons - falling competitiveness, the role of net foreign purchases of bunds, and the issue of 'flight capital' - why the D-Mark will weaken. As evidence of the cumulative loss of competitiveness over a number of years, they note that the pace of net outflows of direct investment from Germany reached almost DM 40bn last year (roughly 40% of the size of the trade surplus), while West German employment has not recovered from the 1992 recession. Mr Brunker believes Germany is pushing for a single currency because it wants to avoid the sort of revaluation of the D-Mark, common in recent years, which took place regardless of German fundamentals. 'The feeling in Germany is that if the single currency is abolished, or even delayed, the D-Mark will go on a strong run again which the economy cannot afford.' * While the FOMC meeting held little joy for currency markets, some better news came in the form of prepared comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, at his confirmation hearings. 'Maintaining the key role of the dollar is important to American growth and standards of living,' he said. Repeating this comment for the second time in two weeks will remind markets that the US authorities are not indifferent to the value of the dollar. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
65,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,OVERSEAS NEWS - TREASURIES STEADY AFTER FOMC MEETING.,"US Treasury prices were relatively steady at lower levels after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged after yesterday's meeting. Few had expected the Fed to lower interest rates after the surprisingly strong figures on February employment were released earlier this month. Treasury prices were lower as the Fed began its meeting at 8am and held at those levels after the FOMC meeting ended. But prices dipped later after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, told a senate panel that the economy was moving 'at a reasonably good clip'. Mr Greenspan, who was nominated by President Clinton to a third term at the Fed, testified before the Senate Banking Committee as part of the confirmation process. In early afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 5/16 lower at 92 3/32 to yield 6.604%, and the two-year note was down 1/16 at 98 15/16, yielding 5.696%. Yesterday's losses came despite a new indication that consumer spending is not likely to spur economic growth in the near term. At mid-morning, the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence slipped to 97.7 in March from 98 in February. Most economists had expected the figure to rise modestly to about 99. 'Although consumer attitudes, on balance, are pretty much in neutral territory, the uneasiness about the job market, coupled with concerns about future levels of income, do not suggest consumers are ready to spend more freely,' the Conference Board said. * Italy provided the focus for attention in Europe, with activity sparked by the suspension of the shares of Banco di Napoli and worries about the cost to the government of recapitalising the bank. On Liffe, Mr Alex Cooper, floor manager with Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, said many traders, who last week bought Italian bonds in the wake of consolidation in Europe and the US, moved quickly to reduce their exposures. As a result, volumes on Liffe were buoyant, with 52,510 contracts exchanged. The June future settled at 107.94, down just over a point. In the cash market, the 10-year yield spread over bunds widened to 448 basis points from 427 points on Monday. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the 'likely size of any recapitalisation is not huge but it has spooked BTPs nevertheless, catching the market on the defensive'. * Other European high-yielders had a mixed day. Spanish bonds closed marginally higher, with the 10-year yield spread over Germany falling from 333 basis points to 331 points. Swedish bonds closed lower, with the 10-year spread over bunds widening to 209 basis points. The Riksbank's cut in the securities repurchase rate from 7.6% to 7.4%, the seventh this year, had been expected. * Fears about the cost of BSE - so-called 'mad cow disease' - continued to overhang UK government bonds, which again underperformed other European markets. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'There has been a real change of investor perception. BSE is the overriding factor in the market just now.' Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds rose by 5 basis points, with the yield spread over bunds, which had narrowed to 178 basis points on Monday, widening to 185 points. Yields on benchmark two-year paper closed 7 basis points higher. On Liffe, June long gilts closed at 104 7/8, down 3/8. * German bonds closed largely unchanged, with yields falling marginally on 10-year bunds and most shorter-dated paper. The market slipped in early trading, following indications from the Bundesbank that an immediate cut in short-term rates was not on the cards, but later recovered ground. On Liffe, 10-year June futures settled at 96.44, down 0.01. * French figures for household consumption in February were as expected and OATs largely tracked bunds. The 10-year yield spread widened by 2 basis points to 23 points. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
66,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Fed spells out stance on rates decisions,"Levels close to zero expected for 6 months Statement allows for changing conditions The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled that it still expected to keep interest rates near zero for at least six months, but for the first time identified factors that could lead to earlier rate rises. In a shift foreshadowed in the Financial Times, the US central bank tweaked guidance in its policy statement that had been unchanged since March, edging away from a simple forecast that it expects to keep rates at ""exceptionally low levels"" for an ""extended period"" - commonly understood to mean at least six months. Policymakers kept the ""extended period"" phrase but for the first time set out the conditions on which this guidance is based: ""low rates of resource utilisation, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"". The statement implies that if these conditions are not met - because of an upside surprise on growth, a pick-up in inflation or a rise in inflation expectations - the Fed may have to raise rates within the six-month period. In making this change, the US central bank spelt out what the market should watch for in terms of the factors that could lead to rate rises. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to shave $25bn off the planned $200bn purchase of debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The decision was justified on technical grounds reflecting ""the limited availability of agency debt"". The reduction only makes the tiniest dent in the Fed's overall $1,750bn asset purchase programme. However, it was notable that the committee cut the $25bn rather than using it to buy Fannie and Freddie mortgage-backed securities. This suggests that it would take a lot to persuade mainstream Fed officials and hawks to increase the MBS purchases - an option some Fed doves want to consider. In spite of public disagreements between Fed hawks and doves in the run-up to the meeting, the statement was unanimously endorsed by the committee. This reflects the fact that there was something in it for both camps. Hawks will be able to point to the reference to ""subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"" as indicating red lines for rate policy. Doves will say that this is obvious and changes nothing, while the reference to ""resource utilisation"" rather than growth highlights the importance of unemployment. If the forecast plays out as expected and the Fed's conditions are met, the Fed will not be raising rates in the next six months. But, the fact that the committee saw the need to tinker with the statement highlighted that this is far from certain."
67,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Fed sees six more months of low rates,"First steps in return to more hawkish stance $25bn shaved off asset purchases The Federal Reserve yesterday took baby steps in the direction of a more hawkish stance on rates, tweaking its guidance on future policy for the first time since March and shaving a token $25bn from planned asset purchases.

For the first time, policymakers identified the assumptions on which this interest rate guidance is based: ""Low rates of resource utilisation, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations."" Implicitly, the statement indicates that if these conditions are not met - because of an upside surprise on growth, a pick-up in inflation or a rise in inflation expectations - the Fed may have to raise rates within the six-month period. In doing so, it clarifies the conditional nature of the Fed rate guidance.

The decision was justified on technical grounds reflecting ""the limited availability of agency debt"". The reduction only makes the tiniest dent in the Fed's $1,750bn asset purchase programme. However, it was notable that the committee simply cut the $25bn rather than transferring it to purchases of mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This underscores that it would take a lot to persuade mainstream Fed officials and hawks to increase purchases of MBS - an option a handful of Fed doves want to consider. In spite of public disagreements between Fed hawks and doves ahead of the meeting, the statement was unanimously endorsed by the committee. This probably reflects the fact there was something in it for both camps. Hawks will be able to point to the reference to ""subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"" as indicating red lines for rate policy. Doves will say this is obvious and changes nothing. The net result is to give the Fed a little more flexibility in the months ahead without signalling imminent rate increases. If the forecast plays out as expected the Fed will not be raising rates in the next six months. But, the fact that the committee saw the need to tinker with the statement highlights that this is far from 100 per cent certain. After the Fed released the policy statement, stocks pared some of their earlier gains, the dollar came under mild selling pressure, while long-term Treasury yields briefly surged."
68,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Evolution Group retreats following investor share sale,"LONDON Evolution Group came into focus yesterday afternoon after one of its biggest shareholders attempted to sell its stake. Shares in the mid-cap investment bank closed 3 per cent lower at 152.7p amid talk that 22m shares, or 9.4 per cent of the company, was being offered to the market. Only two Evolution shareholders hold that much stock; Portuguese bank Banco Espirito Santo (BES) and BlackRock. The talk in the market was that the seller was BES, disposing of what was now deemed to be a non- core holding. The shares are thought to have eventually been placed with new investors at about the 150p level by stockbroker Execution. When Banco first revealed its holding in January 2008, it fuelled speculation that it could be the prelude to a full bid for Evolution, which has been on an aggressive expansion drive in the past year. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, recouped all of Tuesday's losses, rising 70.7 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 5,107.9, helped by a strong opening on Wall Street following the release of positive service sector and employment data. Trading volumes were light, however, with many investors choosing to sit on the sidelines ahead of the statement from the US Federal Open Market Committee. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 jumped 236 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 8,992.7. Retailers led the market higher. Marks and Spencer rose 6 per cent to 361½p as half-year results impressed and the company said it expected a further improvement in margins. Analysts responded by increasing their full-year pre-tax profit forecasts by about 7 per cent to £620-£630m, although good Christmas trading could trigger further upgrades. Next added 5.6 per cent to £19.12 after better-than- expected third-quarter results and upgrading its sales and profit guidance for the rest of the year. ""Sales of autumn/winter clothing appear to have been boosted by an improved product offering and are currently trading ahead of management guidance,"" said Merrill Lynch. Randgold Resource was also in demand as the price of gold hit a record high. Its shares finished 4.6 per cent higher at £45.06. Meanwhile, Mexican silver miner Fresnillo rose 9.2 per cent to 820p as the price of silver advanced in tandem. British Airways rallied 6.6 per cent to 191.8p following reports that Spain's Iberia had hired JPMorgan to help it close a planned merger with its UK rival. Cadbury , however, failed to join the rally. Shares in the group slipped 1.4 per cent to 766p as the share price of its US suitor, Kraft, fell in the wake of disappointing results. ""Kraft's third-quarter results disappointed on top-line growth for the fourth quarter in a row with 0.5 per cent like-for-like sales growth contrasting with Cadbury's impressive 7 per cent,"" said Panmure Gordon. There was speculation that Kraft was poised to go hostile with its original cash-and-stock offer, which is now worth about 723p a share. If that happens, Kraft would then have 28 days to post its offer document and 46 more to increase the terms of its offer to an acceptable level. Housebuilders were the standout feature in the mid- caps. The sector rose sharply after Taylor Wimpey , up 8.2 per cent to 40p, said trading conditions had improved and it was now fully sold for 2009. That news saw Persimmon rise 10.6 per cent to 424p and Barratt Developments put on 12.7 per cent to 136.3p. Barratt also announced a 92.3 per cent take-up for its rights issue and placed the unwanted shares at 120.9p. Chip designer Imagination Technologies moved up 12.7 per cent to 225p after Panmure Gordon issued a ""buy"" recommendation. Increasing its target price to 250p, from 200p, analyst Nick James said the company was bullish on the prospects for Meta, its processor core, which could be used in Android-powered mobile phones. ""It appears licences have already been sold for this type of application and it would be reasonable to expect a partner to be shipping product within a one-two year timeframe."""
69,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Fed hints at hawkish stance on rates,"Central bank tweaks policy guide $25bn shaved off asset purchases The Federal Reserve yesterday took small steps in the direction of a more hawkish stance on rates, tweaking its guidance on future policy for the first time since March and shaving a token $25bn from planned asset purchases.

After the Fed released the policy statement, stocks pared some of their earlier gains, the dollar came under mild selling pressure and long-term US Treasury yields briefly surged. The Fed said it would only buy $175bn and not its original target of $200bn in agency debt, and its purchase programme has helped markets absorb record Treasury issuance this year. After a knee-jerk bounce higher, the S&P 500 was trading 0.6 per cent higher on the day, after being up 0.9 per cent before the decision. With the FOMC maintaining its easy policy stance, the yield on the 10-year note briefly rose to 3.56 per cent from 3.51 per cent as investors sold longer-dated bonds. Gold remained in record territory, shy of $1,000 an ounce, while oil prices were trading above $80 a barrel."
70,2002-12-10,2002-12-11,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Bourses firm as Fed holds rates.,"It was a mainly positive picture in the stock markets as the US Federal Open Markets Committee kept interest rates on hold as expected. Traders and analysts had predicted no change given that the FOMC cut rates by a surprise 50 basis points last month. The best performer in Europe was Germany as technical rebounds by financial stocks helped the Dax index climb more than 3 per cent. French stocks were also stronger in the main but weakness in London and elsewhere left the Eurotop index just 0.3 per cent higher at the close of European trading. However, Nokia's warning about sales for the fourth quarter put a cap on the technology sector. IT stocks such as Nokia, Ericsson and Alcatel were among the laggards, while power stocks surged ahead, including a 4.7 per cent rise for Germany's Eon. German stocks shrugged off a dispiriting outlook on the economy as the ZEW institute's expectations indicator fell by more than expected for the sixth month in a row. The indicator was 0.6, down from 4.2 last month and only just above the level at which contraction in the economy is forecast. The index is based on a survey of about 300 analysts and institutional investors. Last month it showed its biggest fall for many years. Wall Street was buoyed by better-than-expected data on wholesale inventories, which fell 0.3 per cent compared with forecasts of a slight rise. It is the first time in six months that stocks of goods on wholesalers' shelves have fallen. One of the best performing stocks was Maxtor Corp, a maker of computer disc drives, which raised its fourth quarter outlook because of strong sales of new products. The shares surged 25 per cent.

71,2002-12-10,2002-12-11,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Fed keeps short-term interest rates steady.,"The Federal Reserve decided to keep short-term interest rates unchanged yesterday, in something of an anticlimax to recent dramatic developments on the US policy front. But it appeared to leave open the possibility of future rate cuts if the economy failed to emerge from its current ""soft spot"". The Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously at its last scheduled meeting of the year to leave the Fed funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.25 per cent. The rate regulates overnight lending of reserves among banks. Surprising signs of economic weakness have emerged over the past two weeks, raising doubts among investors about the strength of the recovery. But those signs failed to sway the Fed from its position that it had done enough for now. Explaining its decision, it said its previous rate cuts and strong productivity growth were ""providing important ongoing support"" to the economy, but the central bank acknowledged significant uncertainty, adding that it needed more readings on the economy before it could justify new policy moves. The Fed last month reduced rates by half a percentage point as extra insurance against further weakness. In its previous assessment, the FOMC said the economy was working its way through a ""soft spot"", although it acknowledged apprehension among businesses and consumers about risks to the economy. It said again yesterday that the economy might still be stuck in a soft spot. Economic reports continue to send mixed signals - suggesting investment is tentatively turning around and the US economy is stabilising. But businesses are still reluctant to expand operations. Recent data have suggested a sharp drop in demand for unemployment benefits, rebounds in consumer spending and confidence and an acceleration in the growth of service-sector activity. But there have also been indications of a slowdown in the growth of income and home prices and declines in advertised job openings, manufacturing activity and employment. Yesterday, the Institute of Supply Management, a group of purchasing executives, predicted a long ""jobless recovery"". Wholesalers, deeply sceptical about the economy's direction, continue to keep stockpiles extremely lean. The Commerce Department reported the ratio of inventories to sales had recently fallen to an 18-year low. London Edition 2. "
72,2002-12-10,2002-12-11,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries lower as Fed sits tight.,"US government bondswere lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and indicated that the risks remain equally balanced between inflation and economic stagnation. In its last policy meeting this year, the Fed's Open Market Committee said the economy is working its way through its ""soft spot."" The decision had no impact on the Treasury market, which had not expected the Fed to alter the 1.25 per cent Federal funds rate. Some bond market strategists said yesterday that further cuts in rates have become more unlikely following Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's resignation last week. Mr O'Neill's departure has cleared the way for the Bush administration to push ahead with more fiscal stimulus. ""The fiscal stimulus might provide the support needed (for the economy),"" said Joseph Schatz, government bond strategist at Merrill Lynch, adding that this might make it less likely that the Fed would have to ease rates again next year. After the FOMC meeting, the 10-year bond was 5/32 lower at 99 17/32 to yield 4.056 per cent, while the 30-year bond had also lost 5/32 to 106 1/2 with a yield of 4.944 per cent. The two-year note had fallen 1/16 to 100 7/32 with a yield of 1.878 per cent. Short-dated eurozone government bonds again outperformed the long end as comments from the European Central Bank and German economic data suggested a further cut in interest rates early next year. The two-year German schatz, whose yield had earlier hit a3 1/2-year low at about 2.85 per cent, was yielding 2.91 per cent, down 3 basis points. The yield on the 10-year bund was 4.37 per cent, down 1bp. The market benefited from the German ZEW economic sentiment survey, which fell 3.6 points to 0.6 in December, indicating an economy on the brink of recession. Moreover, Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, said late on Monday the central bank was worried about the public perception that inflation was higher than it actually was. The German government will today auction Euros 9bn of new 3 per cent two-year schatz notes, having increased the amount of the issue by Euros 2bn. ""The 20bp rally in two-year yields suggests that the market is not set up for the auction,"" said analysts at UBS Warburg. ""The cover on German auctions has fallen through the year and big auctions (have) suffered more from poor bidding."" UK gilts ended little changed, with the short end of the curve narrowly outperforming longer-dated paper. Although the FTSE 100 equities index suffered a record long eight-day decline, early gains on gilts faded on profit-taking ahead of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement. Long maturities were also hit by talk that the government, which is about to sharply increase gilt issuance, was mulling introducing a new bond maturing between 2035 and 2040. The two-year gilt was yielding 3.822 per cent, down 1bp. The yield on 10-year paper was up 1bp at 4.561 per cent. Japanese government bond prices ended little changed as investors exercised caution ahead of the finance ministry's announcement next week on JGB issuance in the next fiscal year. Investors were also wary of fluctuations in the yen-dollar rate following the appointment of John Snow as US Treasury secretary. London Edition 1. "
73,2006-09-20,2006-09-21,Financial Times,Fed's hold on rates helps stocks higher GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"The S&P 500 index, the US stock market benchmark, reached a 5 1/2-year high yesterday as the US Federal Reserve maintained its current pause in adjusting interest rates. Any nerves about broader fallout of political turmoil in Thailand and Hungary or large losses suffered by US hedge fund group Amaranth faded quickly with investors in a mostly positive mood over the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting on rate policy. Wall Street sentiment was also lifted by a fall in US oil prices to briefly below the level at which they started the year and strong quarterly earnings from Morgan Stanley and Oracle. The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark Fed funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent as expected. All 109 economists polled by Bloomberg beforehand had expected the central bank to do so. The statement accompanying the decision also did not contain any great surprises either with few changes from the August meeting statement. The Fed said the moderation in economic growth appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. However, it removed the word ""gradual"" from the August statement's description of that cooling. The Federal Open Market Committee added that readings of core inflation had been elevated, and high levels of resource utilisation and commodity prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, it said inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting ""reduced impetus"" from energy prices and otherfactors. The statement appeared to slightly disappoint those betting on a more dovish statement. Treasuries and equities pared early gains. The S&P 500 index rose to an intra-day peak of 1,328, its highest level since February 12, 2001. It later slipped back to 1,327.16 by mid-afternoon, making a 0.7 per cent gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite firmed up 1.4 per cent. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the Dollars 61.04 a barrel level at which it ended 2005. It settled Dollars 1.20 a barrel down at Dollars 60.46. Investors largely shrugged off the Thai and Hungarian tumults. The Thai stock market was closed and the baht was flat against the dollar. The Hungarian forint weakened but bounced off day lows to trade 0.3 per cent lower against the euro. The Budapest stock market fell 2.2 per cent. "

By mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,327.16, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent. The rises came as oil prices fell further. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the Dollars 61.04 a barrel at which it ended 2005, but by midday US time was trading at Dollars 61.25, down 41 cents. Michael Thompson, global managing director of research at Thomson Financial, said the market was finally starting to recognise the fact that the US was approaching its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Financial indicate 14.2 per cent earnings growth for the S&P 500 constituents in the third-quarter. Mr Thompson said current estimates indicated companies would maintain this double-digit pace through the first quarter next year - the longest run in more than 50 years. The Thai stock market was closed, and the bahtwas largely flat against the dollar. The Hungarian forint weakened but bounced off day lows to trade 0.3 per cent lower against the euro. The Budapest stockmarket benchmark, the BUX index, eased 2.2 per cent. The Hungarian events did not appear to have a great impact on investor risk appetite. The Vix index, the measure of market volatility that is sometimes called the investor ""fear gauge"", fell 4.17 per cent to 11.48. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 1.4bp to 4.7248 per cent. "
75,2006-09-20,2006-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Dollar declines on US rate outlook.,"Heightened expectations that the next move for US interest rates would be downwards had only a limited impact on world equity markets on Thursday but sent the dollar and US Treasury yields lower. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent for a second successive month on Wednesday, as expected, but reiterated that it felt some inflation risks remained. But David Hensley, director of global economics at JPMorgan, suggested that the sharp recent fall in oil prices meant headline inflation ""would slow to a crawl"" in the fourth quarter. The consequent boost to household real incomes would support consumer spending while the economy absorbed the brunt of the housing slowdown, he added. ""This backdrop gives the FOMC ample room to stay on hold despite the continued breach of its 1-2 per cent inflation comfort zone."" ING Financial Markets went further, saying it was so concerned about the impact of the housing market slowdown on consumer sentiment and spending growth that it believed US rates would be cut to 4.25 per cent by the end of the first half of next year. ""A combination of weaker demand and lower energy prices suggests inflation could fall quickly in the first half of next year, offering the Fed scope to act promptly and aggressively to offset the potential for a more severe economic downturn,"" said James Knightley, economist. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, although the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.2 per cent higher. The S&P 500, which touched a 5l-year high on Wednesday, was up 0.1 per cent. Wall Street's muted showing took some of the shine off an early advance for European stocks, although continued merger and acquisition activity provided support and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at a four-month peak. Serono leapt more than 17 per cent after Germany's Merck launched a surprise bid for the Swiss drugs group, while Spanish property group Metrovacesa jumped nearly 16 per cent as a bid battle for the company intensified. Meanwhile, the dollar fell below the Y117 level and also eased back against the euro, while Treasury bond prices extended the previous day's moderate gains. Emerging markets remained in focus following the military coup in Thailand and political unrest in Hungary this week. ""These events are in themselves unlikely to be big market movers in the global emerging markets,"" said Lars Christensen at Danske Bank. ""However, they are nonetheless adding to risk aversion among international investors."" In Bangkok, the benchmark SET index initially tumbled 4 per cent but subsequently recovered to close just 1.4 per cent lower. The week's events unsettled Turkish investors, and the ISE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent. The RTS index in Moscow was also off 1.3 per cent. But Brazilian stocks, which fell nearly 2 per cent on Wednesday, were down 1 per cent at midday on Thursday amid political uncertainty. The Bux index in Budapest shed another 1.8 per cent, taking its fall since the start of the week to 5.1 per cent. Oil prices rallied off Wednesday's six-month lows, with the benchmark US crude future hovering around the $61 a barrel mark. However, this is more than 20 per cent down from the record high of $78.40 a barrel struck in July and several analysts suggested prices would soon fall below $60 a barrel. "
76,2006-09-20,2006-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : US dollar dips on dovish Fed statement.,"The US dollar slipped in European morning trade on Thursday as the market digested a modestly dovish monetary policy statement from the Federal Open Market Committee. As pretty much everyone expected, the Fed kept US interest rates on hold at 5.25 per cent. However the accompanying statement was a little softer than some had expected, with the Fed noting a ""cooling"" in the housing market, rather than the ""gradual cooling"" seen in the previous statement, as well as highlighting the ""reduced impetus from energy prices"" on inflation. ""The inclusion of falling energy prices as a downside risk to inflation as opposed to an upside risk to growth is something of an unexpectedly dovish tilt, albeit a minor one,"" said Steve Pearson, chief currency strategist at HBOS. Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, said ""the more than 20 per cent drop in oil prices since early August should quell the Fed's fears of upside risks to inflation,"" arguing that the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates as soon as ""end 2006"" as the data ""begin to point to a quicker than expected slowdown"". However most saw the statement as only modestly dovish, with one member, Jeffrey Lacker, once again voting for a rate rise. As the result the dollar drifted just 0.5c to $1.2732 against the euro, Y0.55 to Y116.86 against the yen, 1.05c to $1.8982 against sterling and 0.5c to C$1.1233 against the Canadian dollar. Elsewhere the New Zealand dollar weakened after the island nation's already vast current account deficit widened still further than expected, and Michael Cullen, the finance minister, made another attempt to talk the kiwi lower. New Zealand's deficit rose to NZ$3.08bn in the second quarter, taking the annual deficit to 9.7 per cent of GDP, the worst level since 1975. Mr Cullen commented that: ""looking at the size of the current account deficit, there have still got to be significant downside risks on the New Zealand dollar and both the Reserve Bank and the government want to signal that fact quite clearly."" The kiwi slipped against the weakening greenback, being marked down 0.1c to $0.6593. The Thai baht recovered 0.7 per cent to Bt37.415 to the US dollar as tensions over the recent coup were soothed to some degree by an announcement that King Bhumibol had issued a royal order backing General Sonthi Boonyaratkalin, the army commander-in-chief leading the coup. However the Hungarian forint dipped a further 0.3 per cent to Ft275.38 to the euro following a third night of clashes between police and protesters calling for the resignation of prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany. "
77,2004-12-14,2004-12-15,Financial Times,Vodafone puts City on hold.,"London shares slipped yesterday in cautious trade, dragged lower by weakness in the index heavyweight Vodafone. The FTSE 100 lost 0.3 per cent to 4,722.8 while the FTSE 250 fell 0.2 per cent to 6,715.7. Trading volumes were a solid 3.9bn. Traders said the market was driven more by stock-specific factors than by an overall trend with caution prevailing ahead of the interest rate-setting meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee after the close of London trade. The release of data showing a wider-than-expected US trade deficit in October also dampened sentiment. ""The fall (in the market) has really all been about Vodafone today,"" said one trader. The mobile telecommunications company was the second biggest faller in the FTSE 100, sliding 2.4 per cent to 139 1/2p on concerns it may be drawn into a bidding war with its US associate Verizon for Sprint. The stock was also hit by a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, Vodafone's house broker, from ""outperform"" to ""in-line"". However, not all brokers were taking a dim view of a Sprint deal. Bear Sterns said: ""If Verizon does enter the arena, this could cause uncertainty at the Vodafone level."" But it may be the catalyst to resolve long-term strategic dilemmas about the extent of its US operations. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein also said a Sprint deal might not be a negative story for Vodafone. ""This is no AT&T Wireless,"" the bank said. Vodafone launched a failed bid for AT&T Wireless in February. "
78,2004-12-14,2004-12-15,Financial Times,Fed view unchanged as it raises US rates to 2.25% 'ACCOMMODATIVE' POLICY.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.25 per cent and signalled there had been no change in its assessment of current economic conditions. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left the wording of its policy statement, which accompanied the announcement, virtually unchanged from its last meeting. The Fed said monetary policy remained accommodative, output was growing at a moderate pace in spite of the rise in energy prices, and inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained unchanged. The US central bank said it would continue to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"", and gave no indication of an early end to quarter-point increases. Markets rose slightly after announcement of the rate rise, which had been widely expected. The adjustment comes amid new data showing that high oil prices and retail stockpiling before the holiday season pushed the US trade deficit to a new record in October. The trade gap widened to Dollars 55.46bn (Euros 116.9bn, Pounds 80.6bn) from Dollars 50.9bn the previous month, according to the Commerce Department. It was more than economists had expected and boosted the tally for the first 10 months of the year to Dollars 500.5bn, topping 2003's full-year record of Dollars 496.5bn. Imports of goods and services rose by 3.4 per cent in October to Dollars 153.5bn - the fastest rate in almost two years and far outstripping a 0.6 per cent rise in exports to a record Dollars 98.1bn. The White House is hosting an economic summit with business leaders and economists in Washington today and tomorrow to discuss President George W. Bush's plans for his second term, including Social Security and tax reform. Business groups have told the administration that reducing the fiscal deficit should be its priority. The FOMC also announced that it would in future release the minutes of its meetings three weeks after it meets. It used to keep the details of its deliberations secret until after the subsequent meeting. The minutes of yesterday's meeting will be released on January 4. In one change in its policy statement, the committee slightly toned down its assessment of the labour market, saying that ""conditions continue to improve gradually"" - a slightly less definitive than its November statement. The employment report, released before the FOMC statement, showed 112,000 jobs were created in November compared with 303,000 in October. Ironing out the monthly bumps, however, employment growth has averaged 178,000 over the past three months and 185,000 since the start of the year - fast enough to take in labour market slack and to convince policymakers that employment growth has turned the corner after two disappointing years.

79,2004-12-14,2004-12-15,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed raises interest rates by a quarter point to 2.25%.,"The US Federal Reserve on Tuesday raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.25 per cent and signalled that there had been no change in its assessment of economic conditions. The Federal Open Market Committee left the wording of its policy statement virtually unchanged from its last meeting: monetary policy remained ""accommodative"", output was growing at a moderate pace in spite of the rise in energy prices, and inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained unchanged. The central bank said it would continue to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"" and gave no indication of an early end to quarter-point increases. Bond and stock markets rose slightly and the dollar edged lower after the announcement, which was widely expected. The FOMC has raised rates by a quarter point at each of its last five meetings. On Tuesday it gave no signal that it might either need to move to more aggressive rate increases or pause in its tightening campaign. Tuesday's rate increase came amid new data showing that high oil prices and retail stockpiling before the holiday season had pushed the US trade deficit to a record in October. The trade gap widened to $55.46bn from $50.9bn the previous month, the Commerce Department said above economists' expectations. The trade gap and the low savings rate are seen within the Fed as factors likely to be drags on growth. International concern over the US fiscal and current account deficits has contributed to the recent decline in the dollar, though there is no sign of alarm, judging by the low level of long-term interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, at just over 4.1 per cent, was little changed after the rate increase. In June, before the FOMC started raising rates, it stood at almost 4.9 per cent. The White House is hosting an economic summit with business leaders and economists on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss President George W. Bush's plans, including Social Security and tax reform. Industry has told the administration that reducing the fiscal deficit should be its priority. The FOMC said the balance off risks to the inflation and growth outlooks are both rougly equal. However, a federal funds rate of 2.25 per cent rate is still seen as accommodative, or too low to be consistent with medium-term price stability. Policymakers have indicated they intend to continue raising rates to a neutral level as long as there is no evidence this risks knocking the expansion off track and that the pace of increases will be dictated by the incoming data. The FOMC also announced that it would in future release the minutes of its meetings three weeks after it meets. The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will be released on January 4. The change in policy, to increase transparency, follows discussions within the Fed over the past year on how to improve its communications with the markets. In one change in its policy statement on Tuesday, the committee toned down its assessment of the labour market, saying ""conditions continue to improve gradually"" a slightly less definitive view than in November following last month's weaker employment report. Employment growth has averaged 185,000 a month this year, fast enough to convince policymakers employment growth has turned the corner. The committee also acknowledged in passing that oil prices have fallen recently, a development which, if it continues, will help growth next year. "
80,1998-02-04,1998-02-05,Financial Times,Federal Reserve holds its fire - NEWS DIGEST.,"US INTEREST RATES The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday at 5.5%, confirming the benign inflationary outlook for the US economy. The decision, made at the year's first meeting of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, had been widely expected. Although the economy grew by a faster-than-expected 3.8% last year, there has been little sign of inflation re-emerging. Last week Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the effects of the Asian economic crisis were likely to trigger a slowdown in US growth later this year, prompting market speculation that the Fed's next move might even be to lower rates.

81,1998-02-04,1998-02-05,Financial Times,Technology stocks hold up Wall St.,"US shares were cautiously mixed with the technology sector pushing higher, but most other sectors losing ground, writes John Labate in New York. By early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 35.88 to 8,124.47 while the broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was down 1.19 at 1,004.81. ""The market's somewhat eerily like it was on Tuesday,"" said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Connecticut. ""We had profit-taking in the morning with the Dow down 50 points early on, but the tech sector putting a bottom on the market."" Leading the Dow lower was Merck, off $1 9/16 to $114 3/4, and Johnson &Johnson, which fell $7/8 at $68 5/8. US Treasury prices were mixed by midday. Analysts awaited the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting to decide interest rate policy. By early afternoon the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32 to 103 13/32, sending the yield higher to 5.881%. In the health sector, shares of Aetna climbed $1 11/16 to $78 1/8 after the company announced earnings in line with expectations. USAir announced a restructuring programme late on Tuesday and its shares responded yesterday, rising $1 11/16 to $63. Technology shares continued higher, sending the Nasdaq composite index up 8.87 to 1,675.21. Semiconductor producers were mixed, but Novellus Systems surged $3 3/8 to $43 1/2 while Texas Instruments fell $ at $57 1/8. Among online companies, Netscape Communications surged more than 10% higher to $20 1/8 as the company announced a new venture. Cisco Systems, which late on Tuesday announced strong earnings, advanced another $1 9/16 to $64 9/16. Small company shares also advanced as a group as the Russell 2000 index moved 1.95 higher at 439.75. TORONTO was higher in midday trading as the gold sector staged a rebound on firmer bullion prices. The TSE 300 composite index was 29.15 better at 6,802.6. Gold stocks, which fell more than 5% on Tuesday, gained back most of the lost ground, recording a 4.6% rise.

82,1998-02-04,1998-02-05,Financial Times,Concern over Iraq hits Europe.,"Russian President Boris Yeltsin's warnings on Iraq, combined with a big bund auction in Germany, knocked confidence in European government bond markets yesterday, but US Treasuries fared better ahead of the widely expected decision to hold interest rates. Nonetheless, Sonja Gibbs, senior market strategist at Nomura International, said: ""I would expect a bounce back in European markets tomorrow given the magnitude of the drop today - unless there is a sharp recovery in Asian equities."" Mr Yeltsin's comments, warning that US action in Iraq could spark a global conflict, were reported just as the Bundesbank was in the midst of a 10-year GERMAN BUND auction. In the circumstances, the auction went well, with DM 7.4bn of the bunds taken up, and bids of DM 14.3bn. However, the yield curve steepened, as longer-dated issues were hit by the new supply. The March bund contract in London fell by 0.52 at its worst, recovering to settle at 106.26, down 0.34 on the day. Turnover was active, with over 216,000 contracts traded in London, and 310,000 in Frankfurt. Ms Gibbs argued: ""There's a perception creeping into the German market, misguided in my view, that the economy is going to turn around."" There have been rumours that today's unemployment data will reveal a sharp fall. UK GILTS also suffered from concern that the growing Iraqi crisis could hit confidence in financial markets. The March contract settled 3/8 lower at 122 27/32, some 9/32 off its lows. Trading was brisk, with turnover of more than 86,000 contracts. There was some nervousness ahead of today's pronouncement on interest rates from the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Short sterling futures have fallen by seven basis points this week, reflecting concern that there might be another rise. The adjusted yield spread against bunds widened by one basis point to 112. Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS Securities, said: ""This is the 'last chance saloon' for the hawks in the MPC. It was foolish of the market to ignore the possibility of a rate rise."" ITALIAN BTPs traded in line with other European markets, with the March contract settling 0.29 lower at 117.16, and the spread against bunds narrowing one basis point to 39 points. Carl Azeglio Ciampi, Treasury minister arrives in Bonn today on a two-day trip to ease German concern over Italian membership of European monetary union. The markets have remained relatively sanguine in the face of German criticism of Italian entry, but sentiment will be affected by the sound-bites emerging from Germany. US TREASURIES were mixed as the Federal Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting to set interest rate policy. The consensus opinion on the meeting was that there would be no interest rate change, although opinions were decidedly mixed as to what the Fed would do later in the year. In morning trading, investors favoured shorter-term issues over longer ones. The benchmark 30-year bond had fallen 7/32 to 103 13/32 by early afternoon, sending the yield up to 5.881%. The 10-year note also fell, by 3/32 to 104 3/32, yielding 5.565%, but the two-year note gained 1/32 to 100 1/8, yielding 5.308%. The Federal Funds rate was 5.37%. In overnight trading the yield curve had steepened, reflecting investors' preference for short-term issues. The yield spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond was 57 basis points. The Treasury Department announced new auctions next week. It will sell $13bn in three-year notes, $12bn in 10-year notes, and $10bn in 30-year bonds. ""Investors spent the better part of today jockeying for position around the refunding announcements,"" said Patrick Dimick, Treasury market analyst at UBS Securities in New York.

83,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times,Treasuries lifted by rate pause GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasuries rose and yields fell slightly after the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged for the first time in two years. The Federal Open Market Committee voted nine to one to leave the federal funds rate at5.25 per cent. Ahead of the announcement, futures contracts had implied the central bank was expected to leave rates on hold, but many investors still feared the Fed would continue its steady monetary tightening. Treasury markets took the pause in their stride, with investors already looking to the likelihood of a further pause at the next FOMC meeting in September. James Knightley, strategist at ING Financial Markets, said: ""This leaves the September meeting wide open with the market currently split down the middle in terms of whether the Fed raises rates again."" Yields on the two-year notes, which are particularly sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, were down 3.3 basis points to 4.924 per cent shortly after the Fed's announcement, while the yield on benchmark 10-year notes was barely changed at 4.921 per cent. Government bonds in the UK, Europe and Japan all saw tight trading as markets awaited the Fed's decision. UK gilts were still suffering a hangover from last week's surprise interest rate rise from the BoE, which lifted rates to 4.75 per cent. Clues as to why the Bank made such a move should be forthcoming in today's quarterly inflation report. Yields on the two-year gilt rose 2bp to 4.944 per cent. Those on the 10-year gilt, however, were 1bp lower at 4.661 per cent. Eurozone government bonds were very quiet ahead of the Fed decision. The two-year Schatz yield was down 0.3bp at 3.534 per cent while that on the 10-year bund was up 0.6bp at 3.901 per cent. Japanese government bond traders were also anxious not to move prices. The 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.835 per cent. But traders were forced to make a choice when it came to the five-year, given the government's auction of Y2,000bn worth. The market was reluctant to buy, since traders expected the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged, suggesting an end to the US rate cycle and hence downward pressure on JGB yields. Demand in the five-year auction was only 2.28 times supply, the poorest since September 2003. As a result, the yield on the five-year rose 2bp to 1.380 per cent. "
84,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times,"Labour market likely to move to centre stage in Fed debates With interest rates on pause, labour costs are now putting upward pressure on...","The US labour market is likely to move centre stage in the Federal Reserve's policy debate following yesterday's decision not to raise interest rates for the first time since May 2004. With unit labour costs rising at an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent in the second quarter, labour costs are now putting upward pressure on core inflation. The Fed will not put too much weight on a single quarter's figures. But the rise in unit labour costs is not a single-quarter phenomenon. Data revisions now show these costs rising at an average annualised rate of 3.25 per cent over the past four quarters. Members of the Fed's Open Market Committee will want to be sure that this reflects workers gaining at the expense of shareholders, as often happens late in the business cycle, and not the beginnings of a wage-price spiral. Having argued that the recent rise in inflation reflects companies exploiting pricing power to pass on energy costs to consumers, the Fed will be hard pressed to claim that companies will not be able to pass on higher labour costs too, unless the economy slows significantly. This debate may expose differences within the FOMC that cut across the traditional distinction between ""hawks"" and ""doves"". Fed watchers say that Don Kohn, the Fed's vice-chairman, and Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, pay particularly close attention to whether employment has pushed beyond its sustainable non-inflationary rate. The debate over labour market trends is only one of several key discussions that remain unresolved even though the Fed is now on pause, and render unwise any glib assumptions as to where rates are heading next. According to the Fed's last set of minutes, for its June policy meeting, many FOMC members believed that ""significant uncertainty accompanied the appropriate setting of policy going forward"". One source of uncertainty is the slowing housing market, which creates downside risks for growth. Yet another is that the Fed may have misdiagnosed the nature of the inflation surprise, which could reflect more general overheating or rising energy costs. If so, the Fed may have to slow growth significantly below potential to let off steam. Many private-sector economists believe growth will slow below trend in the second half, and the Fed's staff economists appear to think so too. But the FOMC does not seem to think growth will be much below par in the second half. Members are not even agreed on whether interest rates at 5.25 per cent are slowing the economy, or still stimulating it. Focus on the change in interest rates since the Fed started tightening, and policy looks tight: a total increase of 4.25 percentage points. Focus on the level, 5.25 per cent, and it still looks relatively slack, at least compared with the peaks of past cycles. The FOMC is also not sure about how much tightening remains in the pipeline from recent rate increases. The time lags are particularly hard to judge because rate rises were largely telegraphed in advance. The upshot is that the future path of interest rates is very hard to predict. Prior to yesterday's move, the current market assumption was that the Fed would raise rates one more time to 5.5 per cent before the end of the year, then cut rates twice to end next year on 5 per cent. That is as reasonable as any other guess. But there is a strong possibility that the Fed could have to raise rates considerably higher, or indeed cut them more aggressively next year. The markets will have to stay focused on the Fed. "
85,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times,US inflation concerns spark bond weakness ahead of Fed meeting GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"Fresh concerns about US inflation sparked a bout of Treasury bond weakness yesterday, but financial markets were largely becalmed as investors waited for news from the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting on interest rates. After making 17 successive quarter-point rises in interest rates, the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee was widely expected to take a pause on tightening monetary policy. ""Fed watchers are generally anticipating a pause and 'hawkish' language from the Fed,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. David Bloom, global head of foreign exchange research at HSBC, said the US central bank was unlikely to stop emphasising the ""data dependency"" of its policy decisions because inflation had yet to be brought down to the Fed's ""comfort level"" of near and below 2 per cent. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were all up about 0.3 per cent. European stocks managed even less progress, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index up less than 0.1 per cent. The dollar was barely changed against either the euro or the yen. But Treasury bonds edged back after news that US productivity had slowed in the second quarter but unit wage costs had risen sharply. Lombard Street Research argued that the data made a rise in US rates more likely. ""Labour cost inflation has already reached the point where the Fed can only keep inflation under control and close to its target by means of recession, or at best a hard landing,"" said Charles Dumas, LSR economist. ""Given the new data, the Fed should tighten today (Tuesday) even if the economy is slowing. Substantial slowing is what it needs."" Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics and international business at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that after the recent flow of dismal economic indicators, he was raising the odds of a recession in the US by the end of the year from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. Mr Roubini cited the worsening housing market, mounting inflationary pressures and ever-increasing oil prices. ""Housing alone is now enough to cause a severe US recession,"" Mr Roubini said. Oil prices finally eased slightly yesterday after Monday's sharp rise, which followed news that BP had been forced to shut down North America's biggest oil field. ICE September Brent was down 15 cents at Dollars 78.15 a barrel in late London trade after hitting a record highof Dollars 78.64 in the previoussession. On Nymex, WTI for September delivery was down 18 cents at Dollars 76.80. Edward Meir at Man Financial said that while the amount of oil put out of circulation by BP's shutdown was relatively small, it reduced the overall cushion available to the market without dipping into stockpiles. But he said the timing of the outage was not bad. ""Crude stocks are at record highs, gasoline stocks are comfortable and gasoline demand should start to wane after Labor Day (September 4),"" he said. Angus McPhail, global oil and natural resources analyst at Alliance Trust, said he felt it was more likely that oil prices would rise than fall. ""If the geopolitical situation does not improve and there's a particularly bad hurricane season in the US, we see oil prices (ICE Brent) spiking to Dollars 85,"" he said. Copper futures fell back below Dollars 8,000 a tonne in spite of a strike at the world's biggest copper mine in Chile. "
86,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Equities rally loses steam as traders speculate on end to tightening cycle.,"A rally in global equities ran out of steam on Wall Street on Thursday, as investors pondered the outlook for US economic growth in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to leave US interest rates unchanged after more than two years of rises. Earlier, world stock markets had logged gains in spite of a rise in oil prices following news of an unexpectedly big drop in US gasoline supplies last week. By the close, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was almost flat, down 0.57 points at 2,060.28, having been more than 1 per cent ahead for the day at one point. The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent, principally because of a bad day for the manufacturer Caterpillar. Cyclical stocks and home-builders - both particularly exposed to a US slowdown - bore the brunt of the sell-off. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent. Asian stocks put in some of the day's best performances. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo climbed 1.2 per cent to a two-month high while Hong Kong leapt 1.8 per cent, nearly reaching a six-year high. The main debate for market watchers was the Federal Open Market Committee's Tuesday decision to leave interest rates at 5.25 per cent. Wall Street ended Tuesday lower on concerns it signalled an economic slowdown. This mood reinforced itself by the close on Thursday, although the market opened in more upbeat mood as investors speculated on whether the pause marked the end of themonetary tightening cycle. Goldman Sachs believed rates had peaked. ""The FOMC members acknowledged the upside risk to inflation due to high capacity utilisation and elevated energy prices and left themselves the option to tighten further if incoming data demands,"" said Fiona Lake, global markets economist. ""However, by outlining a view that inflation pressures will moderate based largely on conditions already in place, the committee has left itself ample room to look past more bad news on inflation."" Robert Lind, analyst at ABN Amro, was more hawkish. ""The [Fed's] statement continues to emphasise the data dependency of policy decisions, and inevitably the uncertainty around the outlook,"" he said. ""I read this as the FOMC maintaining a tightening bias. But the markets are clearly reading the 'pause' as a definitive stop in the tightening process."" What now appears to have become the most pressing concern in the market was voiced by Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""Regardless of whether the Fed pauses or actually stops, we believe that economic growth is likely to slow during the next 12 months,"" he said, adding that current conditions, with rising inflation, and the Fed on pause, were similar to those of 1987, the year of the ""Black Monday"" crash. Oil prices were volatile after weekly US inventories data showed strong demand for gasoline and distillates. Benchmark US crude futures briefly pushed through the $77 a barrel level before easing back, while ICE September Brent slipped 27 cents to close at $77.28 a barrel. Speculation on US interest rates put the dollar under pressure. It fell as low as Y114.8 before recovering slightly, while the euro briefly nosed above $1.29. The yen touched an all-time low against the euro as investors increasingly took the view that the Bank of Japan would keep interest rates on hold at tomorrow's policy meeting. "
87,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Stocks rally on speculation US rates have peaked.,"Global equity markets rallied on Wednesday in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's decision to leave US interest rates unchanged after more than two years of rises. The gains came despite a rise in oil prices following news of an unexpectedly big drop in US gasoline supplies last week. The main area of debate for market watchers was the Federal Open Market Committe's decision to leave borrowing costs at 5.25 per cent at Tuesday's monetary policy meeting. Wall Street shares ended Tuesday lower on concerns it signalled a sharper economic slowdown than expected by the market. But a slightly more upbeat mood prevailed on Wednesday as investors speculated on whether the pause marked the end of the monetary tightening cycle. Goldman Sachs took the view that rates had now reached the top of the current tightening cycle. ""The FOMC members acknowledged the upside risk to inflation due to high capacity utilisation and elevated energy prices and left themselves the option to tighten further if incoming data demands,"" said Fiona Lake, global markets economist. ""However, by outlining a view that inflation pressures will moderate based largely on conditions already in place, the committee has left itself ample room to look past more bad news on inflation."" Robert Lind, analyst at ABN Amro, took a slightly more hawkish view.

""Regardless of whether the Fed pauses or actually stops, we believe that economic growth is likely to slow during the next 12 months,"" he said. But there was some good news on the US earnings front as Cisco Systems, the network equipment group, reported impressive quarterly earnings. That helped the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gain 1.6 per cent by midday in New York. The S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent. Asian stocks put in some of the day's best performances. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo climbed 1.2 per cent to a two-month high while Hong Kong leapt 1.8 per cent to its best level for nearly six years.

88,2005-08-09,2005-08-10,Financial Times,Yields fall after Fed rates raise GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasury prices edged higher, and yields lower, after the Federal Open Market Committee increased short-term interest rates for the 10th consecutive time. The widely expected 25 basis point hike leaves the Fed funds target rate at 3.5 per cent, its highest since September 2001. As in prior statements, the FOMC said future rate increases could take place at a ""measured"" pace. Other changes to the wording appeared nuanced, with no obvious shift to the more hawkish stance some had expected. ""This is pretty much as expected, with an improving outlook on growth, though the inclusion of the tame outlook on core inflation may be viewed as friendly by bonds,"" said analysts at Action Economics. Shortly after the announ-cement by the FOMC, the 10-year Treasury yield was 1.6bp lower at 4.410 per cent. Two-year notes were yielding 4.145 per cent, down 1.7bp. Before the rate decision, bond prices had fallen back after a brief boost from data that helped ease concerns about inflation. Productivity growth slowed in the second quarter, but a rise in unit labour costs, a key measure of price pressures in the job market, was far weaker than expected. Eurozone government bonds came under pressure ahead of the US decision but were outperforming their US counterparts. As prices fell, yields on the 10-year Bund were 0.6bp higher at 3.375 per cent. The two-year Schatz rose 1.7bp to yield 2.346 per cent. ""Government bond markets remain under some pressure, and we doubt that this is likely to change soon,"" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. ""Bond prices might not be collapsing, but there is a slow and steady drift towards lower prices."" As investors awaited today's inflation report from the Bank of England, gilts were lower on an improvement in the UK's trade position in June. This offset bond-friendly data that indicated further deterioration in high street sales. Ten-year and two-year gilts rose 0.6bp to yield 4.399 per cent and 4.233 per cent, respectively. Japanese government bond prices fell, responding to a strong rise in equity prices. In spite of the political uncertainty arising from the snap election called for next month, yields on the benchmark 10-year bond hit a four-month high, before falling back to close at 1.410 per cent. "
89,2005-08-09,2005-08-10,Financial Times,Fed makes quarter point rate rise.,"The Federal Reserve yester-day signalled greater confidence on growth and continued vigilence on inflation as it delivered its 10th consecutive quarter-point rate increase and said there were more to come. The Federal Open Market Committee, in the statement announcing an increase in the federal funds rate to 3 1/2 per cent, repeated that it saw monetary policy as still ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace, generally taken to mean quarter-point increments. The FOMC's statement was largely unchanged from the one issued after its June meeting, but the committee gave a more upbeat view on the economy. ""Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since last winter,"" the statement said. Earlier this year the Fed had signalled concern about the impact of oil prices on spending. The committee acknowledged recent better inflation data but made clear its focus remained on inflation risks. ""Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated,"" the statement said. Yesterday's rate increase brings the federal funds rate back to the 3 1/2 per cent level prevailing before the September 11 attacks in 2001. The committee lowered the federal funds rate to 1 per cent by the middle of 2003 and left it there until commencing tightening in the middle of last year. ""It has taken nearly four years to do the round trip and get rates back to 3 1/2 per cent,"" said Mickey Levy, chief US economist at Bank of America. ""The bottom line is that they still see policy as accommodative and expect to continue raising rates at a measured pace. They gave every indication that they will continue to raise rates and that it is the strength of the economy that will lead them to do it."" While the Fed has raised the fed funds rate by 150 basis points since June last year, the yield on the 10-year note, in spite of a rise in recent weeks, remains 40 basis points below the level when the Fed embarked on the tightening campaign. The still low level of long-term rates is likely to bolster the committee's intention to continue raising the fed funds rate. Policymakers have highlighted froth in the housing market, encouraged by low long-term rates, and the knock-on effect on consumer spending. Futures markets have priced in a fed funds rate of about 4.1 per cent by the end of the year, which suggests expectations that the committee will raise rates again in September and November and uncertainty about whether there will be another rate increase in December. Many economists expect the Fed to continue raising rates next year, while some have raised the possibility of a larger 50 basis point rate if the committee decides that inflation risks demand a more aggressive approach. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has said unit labour costs are the key to assessing the core inflation outlook. Over the past 12 months unit labour costs were up 4.3 per cent, but Fed policymakers are confident some of that reflects one-off bonus and stock-based compensation payments. "
90,2005-08-09,2005-08-10,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Rates cycle sets a familiar pattern.,"The refusal, so far, of long-term bond yields to follow short-term rates upwards is the ""conundrum"" highlighted by Alan Greenspan six months ago. But at least one observer thinks the Federal Reserve chairman, of all people, should see no mystery in this phenomenon. Robert Kessler says: ""He started out with the same conundrum."" Mr Kessler, who helps wealthy investors get access to government bond markets on terms usually reserved for big financial institutions, points out that in 1988, the year after Mr Greenspan took the helm at the Fed, 10-year yields started tracking higher with the Fed funds rate - but then refused to budge. Long-term yields hovered around 9 per cent as short-term rates went from about 7 per cent in May 1988 to almost 10 per cent in March 1989 (see chart). Something similar seems to be happening now. After the Fed hiked short-term interest rates for the 10th time in succession on Tuesday, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell. Despite edging higher overall in recent weeks, the yield is still below its level of 14 months ago when the Fed began raising rates. In two intervening cycles, Mr Kessler concedes, 10-year yields did indeed move upwards in parallel with the Fed funds rate, following the conventional wisdom. But he sees similarities between the late 1980s and today that did not apply throughout the 1990s. Towards the end of the 1980s, lax lending on commercial property helped trigger serious problems in the US financial system, most notoriously among savings and loan institutions. Mr Kessler wonders if concerns about lending in the booming US housing market - and about consumer borrowing - could be affecting the bond markets this time around. He also sees little evidence of inflation either in the US or globally. Economic growth - particularly outside the US - hardly looks strong to him. ""The 10-year [yield] is predicting a slowdown,"" he says. ""How about accepting it?"" History suggests that when short-term rates begin to exceed long-term rates - a so-called inversion of the yield curve - a recession is likely to follow. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, notes that six out of the seven yield curve inversions since the late 1960s have preceded recessions. At 3.5 per cent, the Fed funds rate is still below the 10-year yield, which stood at about 4.4 per cent yesterday. But if, as many expect, the FOMC continues to raise rates by a quarter point each time it meets, the short-term rate will reach 4.25 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Rosenberg thinks Mr Greenspan is set on curbing the ""froth"" he has identified in the housing market. If he gets no help from rising long-term bond yields, that could mean taking the Fed funds rate well beyond the 4 per cent or so that many economists estimate to be ""neutral"" - a rate that neither fuels nor slows US economic growth. ""As we saw in both the UK and Australia, by the time those central banks were done tightening interest rates, a very flat or inverted yield curve occurred,"" said Mr Rosenberg during a recent conference call. He predicts a ""range-traded"" 10-year yield for the rest of the year but thinks it will fall to 3.5 per cent by the third quarter next year. Others are less bearish on the economic outlook and think long-term bond yields will rise. Strategists at Barclays Capital, for example, believe the US economy is ""firing on all cylinders"", growth elsewhere in the world will pick up, and 10-year yields will peak above 5 per cent early next year. Nevertheless, they expect a flat or slightly inverted yield curve later in 2006. Whichever view turns out to be closer to reality, Mr Kessler's analysis shows that 10-year Treasury yields tend to fall after the Fed stops raising short-term rates, with a corresponding rise in bond prices. That, at least, has been the pattern following the last four Fed tightening cycles. There should be no surprise about that either, according to Mr Kessler. He says as Fed rate rises begin to bite - usually well into the tightening cycle - they damp expectations for future growth and inflation, both of which influence long-term bond yields. Thus while high long-term yields are often associated with inflationary pressures, high short-term rates can mean something different. ""The higher the Fed raises rates, the more deflationary it is,"" he says. "
91,2005-08-09,2005-08-10,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Yen surges on cocktail of good news.,"The yen surged on Wednesday amid a potent cocktail of buoyant equity markets, a strengthening Japanese economy and signs that Junichiro Koizumi may remain prime minister after September's snap election. The yen has suffered for much of 2005, sliding from Y102.45 against the dollar to Y112.40 earlier this week as the resignation of the reform-minded Mr Koizumi compounded the problems caused by Japan's extremely low bond yields, which have led domestic investors to increasingly seek out higher-yielding paper overseas. However there were signs yesterday that sentment may be turning. Opinion polls published in Japanese newspapers showed an increase in Mr Koizumi's approval rating, while a majority of respondents said they supported his plans to privatise the postal service, the issue that brought his government down. Moreover Japan's domestic corporate goods price index, a measure of wholesale prices, rose 1.5 per cent year-on-year in July, outstripping forecasts and raising hopes that deflation may be on the way to being defeated. Furthermore Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock market index rose 1.7 per cent, extending Tuesday's 1 per cent gain and pushing the index to its highest close since April 2004. Foreign investors are likely to be playing a part in the rally, supporting the yen in the process. In July foreigners bought Y1,323bn of Japanese equities, the highest figure since March 2004. As a result the yen rose 1 per cent to Y110.67 against the US dollar, 1.3 per cent to Y136.68 against the euro and 0.7 per cent to Y198.39 against sterling. Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, saw a ""notable pick-up in demand [for yen] reflecting rising optimism over the economic outlook and falling pessimism over the political outlook."" Yianos Kontopoulos, global forex strategist at Merrill Lynch, added his voice to the yen-bullish chorus, arguing that politics rarely has more than a very short-term effect on G10 currencies. ""The bullish fundamental case for the yen is more compelling than it has been for some time,"" he said. ""The yen is undervalued, the domestic economy is showing increasing signs of sustainable growth and China's new FX regime coupled with expectations of further renminbi strength should support the yen."" Merrill sees fair value for dollar/yen at Y87. Elsewhere, sterling was buoyed by an unexpectedly hawkish Bank of England quarterly inflation report, which suggested last week's UK rate cut may not be the start of a trend. The Bank said inflation would rise above its 2 per cent target in 2007 if it was to cut interest rates again, but be around the target level if rates were now left on hold. ""[The] report indicates that the BoE is in no hurry to change policy further,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. As a result the pound rose 0.3 per cent to $1.7923 against the dollar, a six-week high, and 0.5 per cent to GBP0.6888 against the euro. The US dollar was weaker for much of the session in the wake of Tuesday's monetary policy statement, which was generally seen as being on the dovish side. The Federal Open Market Committee essentially repeated its language from previous statements, despite a general improvement in US economic data in recent weeks. However by mid-session New York trading the dollar had recovered to sit 0.2 per cent stronger at $1.2348 against the euro and 0.2 per cent firmer at SFr1.2609 against the Swiss franc, despite hitting two-month lows against both currencies earlier in the day. With global appetite continuing to rise several emerging market currencies made gains. The Brazilian real rose 0.6 per cent to a 40-month high of R$2.2718 against the dollar and the South Afrcan rand rose 1.1 per cent to R6.37 to the greenback. "

""The yen has clearly been the big mover in the foreign exchange market with a notable pick-up in demand reflecting rising optimism over the economic outlook and falling pessimism over the political outlook,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. The dollar was little changed after Thursday's US interest rate decision. The Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, raised rates by 25 basis points, to 3.5 per cent, for the tenth straight meeting. The committee also reiterated a number of its stock phrases in its accompanying statement, saying monetary policy remained ""accommodative"", labour market conditions ""continue to improve gradually"" and that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be ""measured"". Nevertheless, with sentiment towards the dollar appearing to soften as its post-March rally continues to peter out, the greenback hit fresh two-month lows of $1.2426 against the euro and SFr1.2519 versus the Swiss franc, before recovering a little to sit 0.2c lower on the day at $1.2396 and 0.4 centimes weaker ar SFr1.2550. Sterling was buoyed by an unexpectedly hawkish Bank of England quarterly inflation report, which suggested last week's UK rate cut may not be the start of a trend.

93,2005-08-09,2005-08-10,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed lifts rates a further quarter point to 3.5%.,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday signalled greater confidence in growth and continued concern about inflation as it delivered its 10th consecutive quarter-point rate increase and said there were more to come.

""Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated,"" it said. The fed funds rate is now back to level prevailing before September 11 2001. The Fed cut to the rate 1 per cent by mid-2003, before it started tightening in June 2004. ""It has taken nearly four years to do the round trip and get rates back to 3.5 per cent,"" said Mickey Levy, chief US economist at Bank of America. ""[The Fed] gave every indication that they will continue to raise rates and that it is the strength of the economy that will lead them to do it."" The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was largely unchanged after the Fed's announcement, at about 4.4 per cent. Bond yields have risen in recent weeks, following stronger data and somewhat hawkish comments by Fed policymakers, but remains lower than when the committee started tightening. This is seen within the Fed as offsetting the committee's efforts to tighten monetary policy. Policymakers have also highlighted froth in the housing market, encouraged by low long-term rates, and the knock-on effect on consumer spending. Futures markets price a federal funds rate of 4-4.25 per cent by year end, suggesting the committee will raise rates again in September and November and uncertainty about a similar move in December. Goldman Sachs forecast rates would rise to 5 per cent in quarter point moves without pause by next spring. Deutsche Bank, which had been forecasting a 5 per cent rate late next year, said that following recent stronger data it now expected the Fed to reach that level during the summer. Such forecasts reflect the expectation that the Fed will need to restrict growth to contain inflation, rather than merely returning to a neutral rate, often described in a range centred on about 4.25 per cent. Other economists have raised the possibility of a half point rate increase if the Fed decides inflation risks demand a more aggressive approach. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, sees unit labour costs as the key to the inflation outlook. After falling in recent years, unit labour costs are now rising. The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that productivity growth slowed in the second quarterbut unit labour costs were moderating. In the past 12 months, unit labour costs are up 4.3 per cent, but Fed policymakers are confident some of that increase reflects one-off bonus and stock-based payments. "
94,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, and although trading volume was low - at under 10,500 contracts - the market's broad undertone was said by dealers to be much improved. Ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, it was mostly a day of waiting on events, with just 10,453 contracts traded in the December FT-SE 100 future, down from 16,295 on Monday. The independent traders mostly had the field to themselves and as a result the December contract moved around sharply at times. Dealers said the most encouraging aspect of the session was the solid, general support shown when the contract touched 3,000 around midday. Once or twice the premium to the cash market extended to some 20 points, which put the premium, briefly, in excess of fair value for the first time in weeks. December peaked at 3,030.0 just before the afternoon close and ended nine points up at 3,018. At this level the premium to the cash market is 9 1/2 and the premium to fair value around 18. Traded option volume was 34,570 lots, down from a previous 39,507. FT-SE turnover was 10,776 but the Euro FT-SE was barely traded. British Gas was easily the most active individual stock option with 3,040 contracts. HSBC managed 1,955 lots and BP 1,705. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
95,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - SHARES STEADIER AHEAD OF FOMC RATES DECISION - MARKET REPORT.,"Selling pressure lifted somewhat in the UK stock market yesterday and, although investors remained cautious ahead of news from the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the FT-SE 100 Index managed to regain the 3,000 mark. Traders said that technical pressures had slackened, and that marketmakers had largely succeeded in passing on the lines of stock left with them by the recent spurt of trading programmes. But two more, albeit smaller, programmes were reported yesterday and nervousness over the medium term outlook for equities continued to restrain trading volume. A firm opening on Wall Street, more than 15 Dow points up in UK hours, helped London at the close, as did a steadier trend in bond markets. However, the chances that yesterday's FOMC meeting could have led to a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy had continued to overshadow London trading. The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 8.7 up at 3,008.5, having touched 3,011.3 earlier. The market's return to relative health was also encouraged by a better tone in stock index futures, where the December contract on the Footsie traded briefly during the day at a genuine premium, in contrast with its recent performance. The improvement in the market's technical position may help share prices rally over the immediate term - provided that some investment support for equities reappears. However, few analysts believe that the clouds have lifted in any permanent sense. Market concern that institutional investors are downgrading their equity holdings was further increased when Mr Barton Biggs, strategist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, reduced the weighting of European stocks in his global portfolio by 2 percentage points to 6%. The two trading programmes spotted yesterday appeared to range across the full breadth of the stock market, taking in non-Footsie as well as blue chip issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, drawing less benefit from stock index futures than the FT-SE 100 Index, slipped 3.9 to 3,517.5. Trading volume improved only slightly, the day's Seaq total of 544.9m shares comparing with 515.8m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was worth #1.22bn, at the low end of daily averages but still a healthy figure from the point of view of the London based securities industry, and an indication that the big institutions are not absent from the London equity market. Trading statements from leading British companies produced some features but again failed to encourage the stock market as a whole. In the construction sector, good figures from Tarmac stimulated confidence in the progress of recovery in the domestic economy but brought out profit-takers in the shares. In a generally uncertain retail sector, the first-half report from Sears was followed by increased activity in the shares although no lasting improvement in the share price. Recoveries in bank shares, in the leading pharmaceuticals and in selected consumer stocks was ascribed to the clearing away of the debris left behind by the recent selling bout. These sectors featured in the series of selling programmes reported since the middle of last week and are also closely linked to activity in the Footsie stock index future contract, which has been leading the market lower. Marketmakers are believed to have cleared their trading books, for the time being at least, and would therefore respond readily to any sign of buying interest in equities. But the market is likely to be poised for any reaction on Wall Street to the FOMC meeting. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
96,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR EDGES DOWNWARD.,"The dollar eased against the D-Mark and the yen in late trading yesterday after the US Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, did not announce an interest rate rise at its monthly meeting, writes Motoko Rich. Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y 98.1350, down from Y 98.70. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM 1.5470 from DM 1.5551. In late trading it had dropped below Y 98.00 and DM 1.54. The US currency ended in New York at Y 98.105 and DM 1.5435. The D-Mark strengthened slightly on the European crosses, although political uncertainty in advance of the October 16 general election limited the upside of the German currency. The markets bounced the Italian lira around as they focused closely on the progress of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attempts to pass a suitably tough deficit-cutting budget for 1995. The market had been on tenterhooks throughout the day, in anticipation of an FOMC announcement on interest rates. Most analysts expected that the Fed would not act at this meeting. Still, some corners of the market had priced in as much as a 50 basis-point rise, and the failure of the Fed to produce such a move drove the dollar down. It regained some footing as markets seemed to take the news with equanimity. 'The fact that the Fed has not done anything yet does not mean it will not do anything before the next meeting,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS. 'It is bad, but not disastrous, for the dollar, since the Fed will probably maintain a bias towards tightening.' Meanwhile, the markets continued to await the outcome of trade talks between the US and Japan before the September 30 deadline for sanctions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, arrived in Washington yesterday and indicated that Japan would make an effort to reach a deal on the auto sector, the area which has been the most likely target for sanctions. The dollar moved positively against the yen on the back of these comments and analysts became increasingly optimistic that a reasonable compromise would be reached. Although political concerns kept the market apprehensive about the D-Mark, thin trading helped the German currency maintain, and even strengthen, its position against most other European currencies. Against the French franc it closed unchanged at FFr 3.417. Against the Danish krone it finished at DKr3.928, up from DKr3.926, and against the Swiss franc it ended at SwFr 0.829 from SwFr 0.828. The D-Mark is unlikely to get any inspiration from tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council. In recent days the central bank's officials have been making comments which suggest that a cut in rates, which has been anticipated in some quarters, is improbable. Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen said the bank should pursue a cautious monetary policy while a further reduction in inflation may prove difficult because of rising commodity prices. In addition, yesterday's preliminary national cost of living figures for September came in at 2.9%, basically flat against 3% for August. These factors contributed to a market expectation that the Bundesbank will hold its fire tomorrow. But Mr Cunningham said: 'There is still scope for rate reductions if the trend in inflation continues to go down and the money supply shows a deceleration of growth.' The lira slipped against the D-Mark to as low as L1009.50 in early trading as markets responded negatively to the failure of the Italian government to reach an agreement with trade union leaders on a pension reform plan. But hopes that ministers could pass a budget as early as last night raised optimism about the lira. The Italian currency was further bolstered when Mr Berlusconi said the deficit reduction in the 1995 budget could exceed the previously planned L45 trillion. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America, commented: 'If the government stands up to the unions, even if they go on strike, that should be good for the lira in the long term. The markets want to see a government that has the strength of its convictions.' The lira ended in London at L1006 per D-Mark, unchanged from Monday's close. Sterling tracked the dollar down in late trading, but was relatively steady throughout the day. The pound closed in London at $1.5770, up from $1.5743, and at DM 2.4396, down from DM 2.4482. The December short sterling contract saw 16,350 lots traded and finished unchanged at 93.19, allowing for a short-term interest rate of 6.81%. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of #155m after forecasting a shortage of #300m. Overnight rates traded between 4 3/8 and 6 1/4%. German call money was quoted between 4.30 and 4.40%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
97,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES RETREAT AS FED LEAVES RATES UNCHANGED.,"Longer-dated US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday afternoon after it became apparent that the Federal Reserve had decided against an immediate increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 9/16 lower at 96, with the yield rising to 7.841%. At the short end, the two-year note was off 1/32 at 99 17/32, to yield 6.492%. In the early hours, traders were reluctant to make fresh commitments as the Fed's Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington to discuss monetary policy. The waiting ended at 2pm when the central bank issued a terse announcement that the meeting had adjourned. There was no statement on policy, which led observers to conclude that the committee had opted to delay its next move to tighter credit conditions. Only a minority of analysts had expected a policy change yesterday. Most believed the Fed would wait until after the November elections, despite a recent spate of stronger than expected economic data. Still, prices on longer-data securities backtracked on the announcement, amid concerns that the Fed was falling behind in the race to keep ahead of inflation. Early on, the market was presented with data suggesting the contrary. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had fallen this month to 88.4, against a reading of 90.4 in August. The index, which had been expected to show no change, encouraged the notion that inflation at the consumer level was still not a threat. However, the report was not enough to lift bond prices, with traders preoccupied with the possibility of impending policy decisions. Positioning ahead of an afternoon auction of $17.25bn in new two-year notes was also depressing the market during the morning. Dealers had hoped to wrest concessions from the Treasury when it awarded the securities. In the event, the bidding proved to be lacklustre and the notes were issued at a yield which slightly exceeded expectations. But with the Fed revealing its hand just a few minutes later, the event was quickly forgotten. Trading in European bond markets was very thin yesterday, with few investors prepared to commit themselves before knowing the impact on US interest rates of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US. German government bonds shrugged off data showing that year-on-year inflation in the month to mid-September was 2.9%, a fall from the previous month's figure of 3%. 'The market is waiting on the FOMC and has completely ignored these good inflation figures,' said Mr Pio de Gregorio, European economist at NatWest Markets in London. The market will be watching today's Bundesbank council meeting for a change in interest rates, but Mr de Gregorio said that he did not think there would be a change in rates before the German election on October 16. The December bund future was around 89.01 in late trading, up 0.09 points on the day. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 11.76% yesterday. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the optimism was prompted by hopes that trade union agreement on a cut in spending on pensions would allow the government to reduce its deficit. UK government bond trading languished in the shadow of the FOMC meeting and today's 10-year gilt auction. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said he expected the auction to meet with good demand, but added that other gilts were being sold in order to buy the auction stock. He said: 'This is not new money coming into the market.' Mr Kevin Adams at BZW expected the auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2 times, but added that the switching out of other gilts may mean 'the after-market may be very heavy water'. This meant that if the Fed had increased rates, the market could gain in the morning, but trade off in the afternoon. The spread of gilts over bunds could widen to 165 basis points, he said, against 151 yesterday. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
98,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,US BOND MARKET DIPS AS FED HOLDS RATES STEADY.,"The US Federal Reserve indicated yesterday there would be no immediate move to increase interest rates, despite continuing concern in financial markets about inflation. In its traditional elliptical style, the Fed announced that yesterday's meeting of its policy-setting Federal open market committee had adjourned after more than four hours of discussions and would make no further announcement. Financial market economists said the Fed could still act to tighten monetary policy before the next FOMC meeting on November 15. Bond markets, which have shown much more anxiety about the possibility that inflation might accelerate than either the Fed or the vast majority of professional economists, fell by about half a point after the Fed declined to raise its rates. Equity markets remained largely flat. The Fed has not always announced its interest rate moves. But so far this year, to make clear it is taking action, the Fed has announced all five of its increases in short-term interest rates. When it raised both the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point last month, it said that was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth'. Many economists believe the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy to a steadier and less inflation-prone pace, but markets have been taken aback in recent weeks by signs that growth remains strong. Most alarming to bond investors was the jump in industrial production in August which took the capacity utilisation rate calculated by the Fed to 84.7%, close to the 85% level at which many economists believe industry starts to hit production bottlenecks, pushing prices upwards. While the Fed's first steps to tighten monetary policy earlier this year were widely accepted as necessary, its more recent rate rises have provoked opposition from Democratic members of Congress and business groups. Both feared that the Fed could kill off the economic recovery by raising interest rates too much. New York Comex gold broke $400 an ounce and surged to a fresh 13 1/2 month high after the committee adjourned. The dollar initially fell against the yen and the D-Mark, but quickly regained its footing, rising above Y 98.0 and DM 1.543.

99,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, and although trading volume was low - at under 10,000 contracts - the market's broad undertone was said by dealers to be much improved. Ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, it was mostly a day of waiting on events, with just 9,478 contracts traded in the December FT-SE 100 future, down from 16,295 on Monday. The independent traders mostly had the field to themselves and as a result the December contract moved around sharply at times. Dealers said the most encouraging aspect of the session was the solid, general support shown when the contract touched 3,000 around midday. Once or twice the premium to the cash market extended to some 20 points, which put the premium, briefly, in excess of fair value for the first time in weeks. December peaked at 3,030.3 just before the afternoon close and ended nine points up at 3,018. At this level the premium to the cash market is 9 1/2 and the premium to fair value around 18. Traded option volume was 34,570 lots, down from a previous 39,507. FT-SE turnover was 10,776 but the Euro FT-SE was barely traded. British Gas was easily the most active individual stock option with 3,040 contracts. HSBC managed 1,955 lots and BP 1,705. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
100,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - SHARES STEADIER BUT AWAIT NEWS FROM THE FOMC - MARKET REPORT.,"Selling pressure lifted somewhat in the UK stock market yesterday and, although investors remained cautious ahead of news from the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the FT-SE 100 Index managed to regain the 3,000 mark. Traders said that technical pressures had slackened, and that marketmakers had largely succeeded in passing on the lines of stock left with them by the recent spurt of trading programmes. But two more, albeit smaller, programmes were reported yesterday and nervousness over the medium term outlook for equities continued to restrain trading volume. A firm opening on Wall Street, more than 15 Dow points up in UK hours, helped London at the close, as did a steadier trend in bond markets. However, the chances that a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy could emerge in the wake of yesterday's FOMC meeting continued to overshadow London. The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 8.7 up at 3,008.5, having touched 3,011.3 earlier. The market's return to relative health was also encouraged by a better tone in stock index futures, where the December contract on the Footsie traded briefly during the day at a genuine premium, in contrast with its recent performance. The improvement in the market's technical position may help share prices rally over the immediate term - provided that some investment support for equities reappears. However, few analysts believe that the clouds have lifted in any permanent sense. Market concern that institutional investors are downgrading their equity holdings were further increased when Mr Barton Biggs, strategist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, reduced the weighting of European stocks in his global portfolio by 2 percentage points to 6%. The two trading programmes spotted yesterday appeared to range across the full breadth of the stock market, taking in non-Footsie as well as blue chip issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, drawing less benefit from stock index futures than the FT-SE 100 Index, slipped 3.9 to 3,517.5. Trading volume improved only slightly, the day's Seaq total of 544.9m shares comparing with 515.8m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was worth #1.22bn, at the low end of daily averages but still a healthy figure from the point of view of the London based securities industry, and an indication that the big institutions are not absent from the London equity market. Trading statements from leading British companies produced some features but again failed to encourage the stock market as a whole. In the construction sector, good figures from Tarmac stimulated confidence in the progress of recovery in the domestic economy but brought out profit-takers in the shares. In a generally uncertain retail sector, the first-half report from Sears was followed by increased activity in the shares although no lasting improvement in the share price. Recoveries in bank shares. in the leading pharmaceuticals and in selected consumer stocks was ascribed to the clearing away of the debris left behind by the recent selling bout. These sectors featured in the series of selling programmes reported since the middle of last week and are also closely linked to activity in the Footsie stock index future contract, which has been leading the market lower. Marketmakers are believed to have cleared their trading books, for the time being at least, and would therefore respond readily to any sign of buying interest in equities. But the market is likely to be poised for any reaction on Wall Street to the FOMC meeting. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
101,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,"WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - MOST BOURSES FALTER, SHORT OF INITIATIVE.","The lack of a decision on US interest rates during European market hours left most bourses short of initiative, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was on hold, the AEX index rising just 0.19 to 400.66 with shares receiving a slight boost from gains in the Dutch bond market and in German bunds. Aegon was Fl 2.40 lower at Fl 99.40 after news that the company planned an early redemption of a convertible bond which could inflate the number of shares outstanding by as much as 8%. Heineken and Unilever put in firm performances as investors turned from cyclical to defensive stocks. Each gained Fl 2.00, at Fl 238.30 and Fl 196.50 respectively. Philips closed unchanged at Fl 54 after the Dutch goverment said it intended to give the company a Fl 100m research grant for digital radio and television, and the European Commission said it intended to take a favourable view towards a joint venture being set up by Philips Lighting and Osram, of Germany. PARIS spent a day waiting, not very happily, for the FOMC and results from its own corporate sector. The CAC 40 index fell 1.44 to 1,901.28 in turnover of FFr 2.49bn. Its mood looked negative: Monday's forecast of a 'very, very sharp' 1994 recovery from Peugeot was greeted with a fall of FFr 21 to FFr 772; the Canal Plus acquisition of 24.9% in the German television channel Vox left the French company's shares down FFr 25 at FFr 802. The main results of the day fell after hours. Societe Generale, just after the close, saw at least unchanged 1994 profits; the shares eased FFr 1 to FFr 534. Credit Lyonnais, some minutes later, fell into the expected range with a first-half net attributable loss of FFr 4.5bn; here, the certificates fell another FFr 13 to FFr 374. On the plus side, Eurotunnel recovered 80 centimes to FFr 21.90 after Monday's salt water leak scare, and Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr 6 to FFr 560 although the industrial conglomerate is expected to report sharply lower first-half net attributable profits this afternoon. FRANKFURT caught up with Monday's post-bourse losses during the session, the Dax index declining 9.96 to 2,058.73; but turnover stayed thin, investors awaiting the Washington rates decision and thought unlikely to take firm decisions on the market before the October 16 elections. Attention focused again on Metallgesellschaft, down another DM 14.70 to DM 118.50 after a low of DM 100 in Ibis trading. The shares were quoted at DM 211 only four weeks ago, but the latest falls came in big turnover and dealers yesterday thought it too early to call the turn in this downslide. Turnover eased from DM 5.3bn to DM 5.0bn. After hours, Siemens showed a rise on the day of DM 5 to DM 652.70 after weakness inspired by a magazine article on Monday; the group said yesterday that it was considering spinning off parts of its plant-technology division. MILAN put in a strong performance on expectations that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government would finally unveil the 1995 budget last night, with cuts of up to L48,000bn from public expenditure. The Comit index rose 8.77 or 1.3% to 680.91 as Mr Berlusconi also held out hopes that the government might be about to publish a new calender of privatisations, or revenue targets from disposals. One Milan dealer commented that the market was prepared to overlook the threat of a national strike by trade unions, which had earlier rejected proposed reforms to cut the cost of of the country's pensions system. 'If that is the price that we have to pay for a strong budget, then so be it.' He added that the market was also supported by expectations of positive six-month figures from the telecommunications companies and from Fiat. Fiat led the market higher, picking up L101 to L6,793, while Telecom Italia rose L109 or 2.5% to L4,435 and Stet added L131 or 2.8% to L4,752. ZURICH adopted a weaker bias, the SMI index slipping 5.1 to 2,581.0, with investors unwilling to open new positions. Registered shares in Sulzer, under pressure last week, picked up from early lows to finish SwFr 1 easier at SwFr 923 after the group released lower than expected first-half net profits. However, analysts commented that the positive outlook for the full year and the perception that the first-half figure, while low, was also influenced by seasonal factors, helped to support the stock. Ciba gave up SwFr 8 to SwFr 745, while BBC was one of a few blue chips to move ahead, rising SwFr 6 to SwFr 1,171. MADRID tried to go higher but ended flat, with the general index just 0.07 firmer at 297.24. Turnover amounted to Pta20.6bn, boosted on the day by block trades arrranged by JP Morgan. Strength in Repsol was the most consistent feature of the session, the shares rising another Pta40 to Pta3,190, but in the banking sector Bankinter and Popular came late with gains of Pta200 to Pta11,750, and Pta110 to Pta15,310 respectively. BRUSSELS ended mixed, with the Bel 20 index easing 0.86 to 1,384.95 in thin turnover of BFr 1bn. The Luxembourg-based steelmaker Arbed stole the show with a rise of BFr 270 to BFr 4,770 after it said that a private offering of 1m shares had been priced at BFr 4,550, and oversubscribed. WARSAW accelerated its recent declines in thin trading, the Wig index falling 405.5 or 4.5% to 8,705.2. Turnover shrank by 26.7% to 371.6bn zlotys.

102,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW AHEAD AS FED DEBATES RISE IN RATES.,"Wall Street Blue chips forged ahead yesterday morning as the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm met to consider raising interest rates again, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By 1 pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 16.49 higher at 3,865.73, while the more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 was up a scant 0.88 at 461.72. But the Nasdaq composite was off 0.87 to 754.76 and the American SE composite dipped 0.99 to 452.75. Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 157m shares by early afternoon. After weeks of speculation over the Fed meeting, the big day finally arrived. In early trading, investors held back from fresh commitments as the members of the Fed's Open Market Committee discussed a sixth change in monetary policy since February. Most economists were expecting the central bank to opt to delay its move to tighter credit conditions for a month or two. An announcement was expected by the Fed during the early afternoon. In the meantime, investors received some evidence that the economy was cooling. The Conference Board said that its September index of consumer confidence had fallen from its August levels. Most analysts had expected the index to hold steady. It was a hopeful sign for investors, who feared that the prospect of accelerating inflation would prompt the Fed to lift rates yesterday, although it was unlikely that the reading would have had any influence on the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Bonds held steady amid the uncertainty, but blue chips were able to make some progress in the morning hours, carrying through a flurry of buying that lifted the Dow industrial index by 17 points the previous day. The gains were fractional, with the exception of Alcoa. The aluminium supplier's stock climbed $1 1/4 to $86 5/8, lifted by a 'buy' recommendation from PaineWebber. Elsewhere, share prices were mixed, with corporate news moving a few individual issues higher and lower. By early afternoon, the declines on the Big Board were holding a slight edge on advances. In telecommunications, Nynex gained $1 1/8 to $37 1/8 after submitting a seven-year framework agreement for regulating phone services in New York state, its primary market. A coalition of telecom providers, including MCI and AT and T, is offering active opposition to the proposal. In retailing, Gap Stores lost $1 3/8 to $30 5/8. CS First Boston lowered its estimate of the company's third-quarter and fiscal 1995 earnings. Micron Technology, the semiconductor supplier, receded $7/8 to $35 1/8. Trading in the shares remained brisk following a CS First Boston downgrade. Texas Instruments was down $3/8 to $67 7/8 even though Morgan Stanley placed it on its 'buy' list. 20th Century Industries, the insurance group hard hit by the California earthquake last winter, jumped $1 5/8 to $11 on news that American International Group had agreed to help shore up its financial position as part of a broad strategic alliance. AIG receded $3/8 to $89 5/8. A downward drift on the Nasdaq was led by Lotus Development, which shed $1 3/16 to $35. Fresh Choice, a restaurant chain, lost $2 1/4 to $21 on disappointment over its third-quarter results. Canada Toronto relinquished early gains to trade mixed at midday, the TSE 300 composite index standing 3.26 higher at 4,344.68 in low volume of 20.4m shares. Six of the 14 sub-indices were higher, led by real estate and construction which put on 2.0% as Intrawest rose C$5/8 to C$13 3/8. Four Seasons Hotels put on C$2 3/8 to C$16 5/8 after the Saudi Arabian prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud agreed to take a 25% stake. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
103,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,"WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - NIKKEI FALLS BELOW 19,500 TO FIVE-MONTH LOW.","Tokyo Stocks plummeted in thin trading to their lowest levels since April as arbitrageurs unwound positions following a plunge in index futures prices, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average fell 345.47 to finish at 19,468.89, the first close below support at 19,500 since April 4. After reaching the day's high of 19,822.16 during the morning, the index declined to a low of 19,404.18 in the final half-hour of trading. On September 19, when the Nikkei 225 last approached the 19,500 mark, public funds moved in to arrest the decline. This time, public funds, comprising state run postal savings and insurance, seemed to remain on the sidelines. Volume was an estimated 231m shares, little changed from Monday's 239.41m. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 22.46 to 1,562.75, while the second section lost 5.59 at 2,231.43 in volume estimated at 5.99m shares. Losers surged ahead of winners by 769 to 227, with 159 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE Nikkei 50 index gained 2.63 at 1,279.43. As on Monday, most traders stayed on the sidelines, reflecting uncertainties surrounding the US-Japan framework talks and Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. Yesterday was also the last trading day for delivery of September index futures. The thinness of the market made it vulnerable to a wave of afternoon selling that began with futures traders closing positions. The ensuing decline in futures prices triggered dumping of speculative stocks and unwinding of arbitrage positions. The resulting price slide was accelerated by index-linked selling and rumours that Morgan Stanley was cutting the weighting of Japanese stocks in its portfolio. Japan Telecom, being closely watched ahead of next month's listing of Japan Tobacco, fell Y 30,000 to another low of Y 4.02m. Other telecommunications stocks were mixed. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y 1,000 to Y 884,000, but DDI, which lost Y 8,000 on Monday, rallied Y 7,000 to Y 878,000. Steelmakers suffered losses in some of the heaviest trading of the day. Nippon Steel, the volume leader, edged down Y 2 to Y 385. Kobe Steel slipped Y 5 to Y 326, Kawasaki Steel lost Y 6 to Y 432 and NKK ticked down Y 1 to Y 289. Electricals also came under fire. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y 30 to Y 1,600, Fujitsu Y 10 to Y 1,040, Hitachi Y 10 to Y 955 and Oki Electric Industrial Y 5 to Y 755. In Osaka, the OSE average slid 257.66 to 21,843.87 in volume of 36.3m shares. Roundup Lassitude afflicted several of the region's equity markets, as investors sat on their hands in advance of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington. However, there were one or two winners. HONG KONG closed mildly weaker in drowsy trading, the Hang Seng index easing 33.39 to 9,610.24 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.50bn to HKDollars 2.85bn. HSBC, the most active issue, lost 25 cents at HKDollars 87.50. It was followed by Hongkong Land, down 10 cents at HKDollars 19.35, while Hong Kong Telecom was 10 cents off at HKDollars 15.50. Sino Land, the most active of the new index entries on Monday, retreated 12.50 cents to HKDollars 8.625, and Johnson Electric declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 21.50. SYDNEY was nervous about interest rates as the All Ordinaries index dipped 16.2 to 2,013.8. Resources issues were dragged down by falls in the golds sector following a bullion price decline in New York, and by lower commodity prices in the US. The gold shares index dropped 46.5, or nearly 2%, to 2,343.8. Newcrest Mining lost 29 cents at A$6.50 and Placer Pacific 5 cents at A$3.93. SINGAPORE took a last minute dive and the Straits Times Industrial index relinquished 9.97 to close at 2,289.84. The fall was caused mainly by a loss of 60 cents in Cycle and Carriage to S$12.80, and a 30-cent retreat to S$11 by Sembawang Corp. Before that, investors seemed to believe that the Federal Reserve meeting could yield at most a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates, and that this would be acceptable. MANILA combined fears of another rise in US interest rates with worries about delays in the implementation of the value added tax (VAT), which could put more pressure on the Philippine government deficit. The composite index ended 9.93 down at 2,934.27. BOMBAY, also risk-averse, fell on fears of a plague attack in western India. Following Monday's halt in trading, the BSE 30-share index lost 51.97 at 4,444.56. SEOUL registered a strong rebound in blue chips as the composite index finished 6.89 better at a new closing high of 1,052.01. In spite of the rise, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 452 to 367. KARACHI, similarly, majored on index heavyweights as the KSE 100 index rose 17.48 to 2,237.65. Investors took positions in energy and synthetics, said a dealer. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
104,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR EDGES DOWN.,"The dollar fell by nearly a pfennig in late trading yesterday as markets waited to see if the US Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, would raise interest rates, writes Motoko Rich. Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y 98.1350, down from 98.70. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM 1.547 from DM 1.5551. The D-Mark strengthened slightly on the European crosses, although political uncertainty in advance of the October 16 general election limited the upside of the German currency. The markets focused closely on the progress of the Italian budget and bounced the lira around, reflecting the travails of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in his attempt to pass a suitably tough deficit-cutting budget for 1995. A market expectation that the FOMC meeting would yield either no movement, or at most a 50 basis point hike, pushed the dollar down against the D-Mark. Most investors have already priced in a 50 basis point hike, and anything else was expected to be negative for the dollar. Meanwhile the dollar was tightly range-bound against the yen as the markets awaited the outcome of trade talks between the US and Japan before the September 30 deadline for sanctions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, arrived in Washington yesterday and indicated Japan would make an effort to reach a deal with the US on the auto sector, the area which has been the most likely target for sanctions. The dollar moved positively against the yen on the back of these comments and analysts became increasingly optimistic that a reasonable compromise would be reached. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan, said: 'There was a belief that US officials had a dollar devaluation policy but that view is receding,' he said. 'So we may be overplaying the importance of these trade talks.' Although political concerns kept the market apprehensive about the D-Mark, thin trading helped the German currency maintain, and even strengthen, its position against most other European currencies. Against the French franc, it closed unchanged at FFr 3.417. Against the Danish krone, it finished at DKr3.928, up from DKr3.926 and against the Swiss franc, the D-Mark closed at SwFr 0.829, up from SwFr 0.828. The D-Mark is unlikely to get any inspiration from tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council, where changes in interest rates are not largely expected. In recent days the central bank's officials have been making comments which suggest that a cut in rates, which has been anticipated in some quarters, is improbable. Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen said the bank should pursue a cautious monetary policy while a further reduction in inflation may prove difficult because of rising commodity prices. In addition, yesterday's preliminary national cost of living figures for September came in at 2.9%, basically flat against 3% for August. These factors contributed to a market expectation that the Bundesbank will hold its fire tomorrow. But Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS, said this situation would not hold forever. 'There is still scope for rate reductions if the trend in inflation continues to go down and the money supply shows a deceleration of growth,' he said. The lira slipped against the D-Mark to as low as L1009.50 in early trading as markets responded negatively to the failure of the Italian government to reach an agreement with trade union leaders on plans to reform Italy's pension system. But hopes that ministers could pass a budget as early as last night raised optimism about the lira. The Italian currency was further bolstered when Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced that the deficit reduction in the 1995 budget could exceed the previously planned 45 trillion lira. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America said: 'If the government stands up to the unions, even if they go on strike, that should be good for the lira in the long term. The markets want to see a government that has the strength of its convictions.' Against the D-Mark, the lira finished in London at L1006, unchanged from its Monday closing rate. Sterling tracked the dollar down in late trading, showing that it has not detached completely from the US currency. Against the dollar, the pound closed in London at $1.577, up from $1.5743 and against the D-Mark, it finished at DM 2.4396 from DM 2.4482. The December short sterling contract traded 16,350 lots to finish unchanged at 93.19, allowing for a short-term interest rate of 6.81%. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of #155m after forecasting a shortage of #300m. Overnight rates traded between 4 3/8 and 6 1/4%. German call money was quoted at between 4.30 and 4.40%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
105,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES STEADY AS FED CONSIDERS RATES MOVE.,"US Treasury bonds held fairly steady yesterday morning as the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm considered the merits of a sixth increase in short-term interest rates this year. By 1pm, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1/8 lower at 96 13/32 with the yield rising to 7.805%. At the short end, the two-year note was off 1/32 at 99 17/32, to yield 6.492%. At the opening, the uneasy calm which had dominated the previous session held prices close to their starting values. Traders were generally reluctant to make fresh commitments until receiving news about any decision reached by members of the Fed's Open Market Committee, who were meeting in Washington. Most observers were expecting the central bank to opt for delaying its next move to tighter credit conditions until after the November elections. An announcement from the Fed was expected during the early afternoon. Early trading was complicated by the government's auction of $17.25bn in new two-year notes, scheduled to begin at 1pm. Primary dealers, who are authorised to participate in such sales, attempted to drive down prices at the short end in an effort to wrest concessions from the Treasury when it awarded the issue. That strategy proved to be marginally successful, as bond prices across the maturity range dipped in light trading. The downturn might have been steeper but for some positive economic news. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had fallen this month to 88.4, against a reading of 90.4 in August. The fall in the index, which had been expected to show little change on August, encouraged the notion that consumer inflation was still not a threat to the value of fixed-rate investments. The favourable surprise lent some support to the market, but its effect was to build a floor in prices, rather than provide a springboard for an advance. However, the tone was expected to shift dramatically in one direction or the other as the afternoon's events unfolded. Trading in European bond markets was very thin yesterday, with few investors prepared to commit themselves before knowing the impact on US interest rates of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US. German government bonds shrugged off data showing that year-on-year inflation in the month to mid-September was 2.9%, a fall from the previous month's figure of 3%. 'The market is waiting on the FOMC and has completely ignored these good inflation figures,' said Mr Pio de Gregorio, European economist at NatWest Markets in London. The market will be watching today's Bundesbank council meeting for a change in interest rates, but Mr de Gregorio said that he did not think there would be a change in rates before the German election on October 16. The December bund future was around 89.01 in late trading, up 0.09 points on the day. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 11.76% yesterday. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the optimism was prompted by hopes that trade union agreement on a cut in spending on pensions would allow the government to reduce its deficit. UK government bond trading languished in the shadow of the FOMC meeting and today's 10-year gilt auction. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said he expected the auction to meet with good demand, but added that other gilts were being sold in order to buy the auction stock. He said: 'This is not new money coming into the market.' Mr Kevin Adams at BZW expected the auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2 times, but added that the switching out of other gilts may mean 'the after-market may be very heavy water'. This meant that if the Fed had increased rates, the market could gain in the morning, but trade off in the afternoon. The spread of gilts over bunds could widen to 165 basis points, he said, against 151 yesterday. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
106,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL BONDS - INDOVER BANK LAUNCHES THREE-YEAR FRN.,"There was a dearth of new eurobond issues yesterday, with bond markets nervous ahead of the US FOMC monetary policy meeting. Syndicate managers said conditions have worsened in recent days, with eurobond spreads over the underlying government bond market widening most markedly in the dollar and sterling sectors. 'The dollar market has recently been underpinned by good retail flows but these have now slowed,' said Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president at Kidder Peabody. 'The dollar market is suffering from uncertainty caused by the FOMC, quarter-end considerations and the fact that retail flows out of Switzerland and Benelux countries have slowed, particularly at the long-end of the market,' he said. Attention today is likely to turn to Lebanon's debut eurobond offering of $300m of three-year fixed-rate notes, increased yesterday from $150m due to unexpectedly strong demand. The bonds are expected to carry a coupon of around 10%, yielding around 325 to 350 basis points over US government bonds. Indover Bank, a Dutch subsidiary of the Indonesian central bank, launched its first foray into the international capital markets with a $125m offering of three-year floating-rate notes, offering a spread of 67 1/2 basis points over three-month Libor. Lead manager HSBC Markets said 70% of the bonds were sold into Europe, with the remainder placed in South East Asia. 'This is the bank's first transaction and it was anxious to come into the mainstream of the market, which at the moment is the short-term, floating-rate dollar sector,' it said. The Kingdom of Belgium's DM 1bn offering of five-year bonds, which was launched on Monday, was priced yesterday to yield 25 basis points over German government bonds, which some syndicate managers said was expensive. Hongkong International Terminals, a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa, is expected to launch a $1.74bn offering of 10-year floating-rate notes in the next 10 days. The notes will carry a coupon of Libor plus 85 basis points, with a call option at the end of the fourth year. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
107,1994-09-27,1994-09-28,Financial Times,US FED HOLDS OFF RATE RISE DESPITE FEAR OF INFLATION.,"The US Federal Reserve indicated yesterday that there would be no immediate move to increase interest rates despite growing fears of rising inflation In its traditional elliptical style the Fed announced that yesterday's meeting of its policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee had adjourned after more than four hours of discussions and would make no further announcement. Financial market economists said the Fed could still act to tighten monetary policy before the next FOMC meeting on November 15. So far this year, the Fed has announced all five of its increases in short-term interest rates. When it raised both the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point last month it said that was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth."" But economists, who had earlier thought the Fed had succeeded in slowing the economy to a steadier and less inflation-prone pace, have been taken aback in recent weeks by signs that growth remains strong. Most alarming to the financial markets was the jump in industrial production in August which took the capacity utilisation rate calculated by the Fed to 84.7%, close to the 85% level at which many economists believe industry starts to hit production bottlenecks, pushing prices upwards. While the Fed's first steps to tighten monetary policy earlier this year were widely accepted as necessary, its more recent rate rises have provoked opposition both Democratic members of Congress and business groups. Both feared that the Fed could kill off the economic recovery by raising interest rates too much. New York Comex gold broke $400 an ounce and surged to a fresh 13 1/2 month high after the committee adjourned. The dollar initially fell against the yen and the D-Mark, but quickly regained its footing, rising above Y 98.0 and DM 1.543. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
108,2001-05-15,2001-05-16,Financial Times (FT.Com),Growth gamble.,"As the debate continues over the prospects for the US recovery, the Fed is taking no chances. Its statement on Tuesday called the half point cut in interest rates a response to continuing weakness of the economy at home and abroad and diminishing inflationary pressures. Its tone suggested that further cuts might be on the way. The Federal Open Market Committee's judgment on Tuesday was a difficult one. While Wall Street has been looking for the bottom of the downturn, the news from Main Street has been unremittingly negative. Profits in the first quarter of the year plunged, partly because of rising energy costs, but mostly because of waning demand. This week's industrial production figures added to the gloom. Worst hit have been the technology sector and business equipment manufacturers, victims of the slowdown in investment. But the pain is becoming widespread. Few industries are immune to flagging US demand. The speed of the industrial slowdown is beyond doubt. The problem for the Fed was to judge how worrying this really is. It is still possible that the US is experiencing a one-off adjustment to a period of exceptionally strong performance. In high-technology industries, for instance, output has been falling at a rate of around 1 percentage point per month since the start of the year, but in April it was still up nearly 20 per cent on an annual basis. It is also at least possible that changes in US business practice are having a telescoping effect. If so, this would help to explain the severity of the slowdown. For instance, while the past few months have shown the depressing effects of the inventory cycle, changing inventory management techniques have probably speeded up the adjustment. Likewise, the rapid decline in payroll employment may indicate that US firms are more willing to shed costs at an early stage, rather than hang on to staff for as long as possible. The other major factor which the Fed had to take into account was the relative strength in the household sector. Consumer confidence is no longer declining, and according to one measure may even be rising. April's retail sales figures were good. Wage growth is strong. These conditions might have made the Fed wary of seeming to take a chance with inflation by shoring up America's debt-ridden consumers - and, for that matter, the financial markets. But with Tuesday's decision, Alan Greenspan showed that despite the risks, his instincts still lie with supporting growth. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties, he would be well advised to pause before a further cut. "
109,2003-01-29,2003-01-30,Financial Times,LEX COLUMN - Gulf in explanation LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Reserve has placed its bet on ""oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical risks"". It is little surprise that the Fed left interest rates on hold yesterday. Its explanation that war risk is holding back business investment and spending and - once the picture becomes clearer - the recovery will follow is a little surprising. Is the threat of war really the only thing holding back investment and recruitment? Much like a year ago, monetary policy is extremely accommodative, there will be support from fiscal policy in some form and geopolitical risk clouds the outlook. But the danger remains that a falling stock market could again undermine confidence in the recovery. Geopolitical risks are part of the reason for corporate reticence. But so is past over-investment, continuing overcapacity, the lack of topline growth, pricing pressure, and a continued preference for balance sheet repair. Housing market activity remains buoyant, but it is surely worrying for corporate decision-makers that the US consumer is showing signs of fatigue. Meanwhile, the rest of the world economy is in dismal shape. The fourth quarter ""soft spot"" may be followed by a rebound in the first quarter. And a quarter-point rate cut is not going to kickstart US corporate spending. Having shifted to a neutral policy bias in November, perhaps prematurely, the FOMC may not want to reverse that now. But, even with short rates so low, it is hard to be confident the risks are balanced, or that Saddam Hussein is the sole reason for concern. London Edition 1. "
110,2003-01-29,2003-01-30,Financial Times (FT.Com),A funny way to manage Europe's money.,"When the chancellor of the exchequer announced that the Bank of England would become independent, that interest rate decisions would be made by a monetary policy committee and responsibility for banking supervision would be transferred to a newly created Financial Services Authority, Edward George, the Bank's governor, read the bill only when the ink had dried. The European Union has decided to do things differently when preparing the European Central Bank for enlargement of the eurozone to up to 25 countries. The outcome could be a bad system, one that risks undermining the credibility of the euro. Under current rules, the central bank governor of each new eurozone member would get a vote on the ECB's key decision-making body, the governing council. The council could thus grow to 30 members, including the six members of the executive board - too many for efficient decision-making. Under the Nice treaty, heads of government will decide how to reform the ECB's voting rules ""acting on a proposal by the ECB itself or by the European Commission"". Since the Commission has neglected to produce a proposal, the bank has presented its own: a rotation system whereby not every central bank governor would have a right to vote at each meeting. Eurozone members would be divided into three groups. The first, to include Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain (if it joins), would have four votes. The second group, to be half the total number of eurozone members, would have eight votes. The remaining countries would share three votes. Thus the number of votes in the governing council would be capped at 21. This complex proposal has three main flaws. First, it violates the spirit of the ECB statutes, which stipulate that national central bank governors sit on the governing council in a personal and independent capacity, not as national representatives. Second, the cap is set far too high. Today's council of 18 members is already too large. It therefore has a bias towards the status quo - interest rates are sometimes kept unchanged simply because it proves difficult to gather consensus in favour of change. Third, the composition of the voting team will keep changing. How frequently depends on how long some members go without a vote, something the ECB has not yet explained. The ECB's plan was clearly the result of a deal among the current members of the governing council. None of today's 12 eurozone countries stands to lose its vote for several years. To keep tiny Luxembourg happy, countries would be assigned to the three groups according the size of their financial system as well as their gross domestic product. Thus the Grand Duchy, in Group 2, would have a vote more often than Poland in Group 3. Best practice in central banking strongly argues in favour of delegating interest rate decisions to an independent committee. This is the model in Sweden, Australia, Canada and New Zealand as well as in Britain. Delegation to a committee is consistent with the ECB statutes. It is also consistent with EU decision-making in other areas. The Union has clear supra-national executive power in two areas only: monetary policy and competition policy. In the latter, power has been delegated to a committee - the European Commission. It is true the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which sets interest rates, operates a partial rotation system among regional reserve banks. But the number of committee members with the right to vote is limited to 11 - and seven of those votes are reserved for members of the Fed's board of governors. Under the ECB's own plan the executive board, which speaks for the eurozone as a whole rather than for national interests, would eventually account for only six out of 21 votes. The Federal Open Market Committee, moreover, is dominated by its chairman. In the ECB national central bank governors are the strongmen, largely because many still act as financial market supervisors. Delegation of monetary policy to independent bodies, such as the ECB, is appropriate. What is not is for such bodies to be left to design themselves. National central bank governors should never have been allowed to propose new voting rules for the ECB. It was inevitable that they would come up with rules designed to protect their own interests. EU leaders should think hard before accepting the ECB plan. The writer is professor of economics at Bocconi University and a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. "
111,2007-05-09,2007-05-10,Financial Times,THE SHORT VIEW.,"Move along please, nothing to see here. The Federal open market committee's decision to leave its target Fed Funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent yesterday surprised nobody.  All 101 economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted it.  The language in their communique is almost unchanged, beyond acknowledging that ""economic growth slowed in the first part of this year"", which we knew already. Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, and his colleagues may have learnt from the confusion that they triggered in the market with many subtle changes to their statement in March. This time, the bottom line is clear. Inflation and not slowing growth is the committee's ""predominant policy concern"". It will not cut without either a significant rise in unemployment or a financial markets meltdown.  Some traders had hoped for a hint that the Fed was less worried about inflation. That showed up in slightly higher bond yields and a slightly stronger dollar. But this did not stop the S&P 500 from closing at yet another new six-year high.  Today will be more exciting. With UK inflation now above 3 per cent, a rate rise from the Bank of England is a given. But will it be 25 or 50 basis points?  Markets are braced for 50 basis points of tightening over the next 12 months. Doing it all at once might make the BoE look rattled. But it would take the market by surprise. It might work better (bearing in mind Bernanke's experience in March) than an attempt to exert the same effect on the market through the use of rhetoric.  Rate rises may be the only language they understand.  Expect no such excitement from the European Central Bank, which is universally expected to leave rates on hold today. Even the risk of misunderstandings looks minimal. Look out for one little word. If the ECB says it is ""vigilant"", it will raise rates next month. If not, not. This is boring but it is not central bankers' job to be entertaining.  "
112,2007-05-09,2007-05-10,Financial Times,Cisco's limp revenue guidance holds back techs.,"Wall Street was mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve signalled that interest rate policy was on hold and reiterated that inflation remained the main risk for the economy.  Meanwhile, the technology sector was weighed down by revenue guidance from Cisco that disappointed investors.  At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 index was up a fraction at 1,507.93, led by gains in Telecom and Financial stocks, while energy led losses.  The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates steady and still flag concerns over inflation, sparked a brief bout of selling in stocks, that knocked them off their best levels for the day.  The housing market re-mains one of the economy's weak spots, highlighted yesterday when Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes, warned that it would not meet recent quarterly and annual guidance. Its shares fell 1.2 per cent to Dollars 28.85.  Beyond the FOMC meeting, analysts said the outlook for stocks remained positive.  A major talking point among investors yesterday was Cisco as its shares slid 6.3 per cent to Dollars 26.57. The computer network operator's fiscal third-quarter profits rose 34 per cent from a year ago, but investors were hoping for more robust revenue guidance. Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 0.2 per cent at 2,5567.16.  Blue-chips were a little firmer and at mid-afternoon the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1per cent at 13,320.86.  Walt Disney shares were down 1.2 per cent at Dollars 36.11, after the stock set a six-year high of Dollars 36.57 on Tuesday.  IBM boosted the Dow after Goldman Sachs upgraded it to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" due to itys plans to repurchase stock and cut costs.  That reversed Goldmans' downgrade made last week. IBM shares were up 0.9 per cent at Dollars 104.22, after setting a 52-week high of Dollars 104.75 earlier in the morning.  In other earnings news, News Corp reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting analysts' estimates. The media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch launched a Dollars 5bn bid for Dow Jones last week, but has been rebuffed by the Bancroft family which controls the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. News Corp was 2.1 per cent lower at Dollars 23.16 at mid-afternoon.  One of the biggest movers yesterday was drugmaker Dendreon. The stock plunged 61.3 per cent to Dollars 6.86 after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.  Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, a speciality drugmaker, slid 11.7 per cent to Dollars 15.90, after the FDA sought details about its experimental drug to treat smoking and gambling addiction.  Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 3.1 per cent to Dollars 10.22 after it agreed to develop and market a cholesterol drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb.  "
113,2007-05-09,2007-05-10,Financial Times,Dollar holds steady after Fed decision.,"The dollar held steady against the euro yesterday as the Federal Reserve left US interest rates on hold for the seventh consecutive meeting.  The central bank's decision to keep rates at 5.25 per cent came as no surprise.  The accompanying statement, which reiterated that the Fed's predominantconcern remained the risk that US inflation failed to moderate as expected, was little changed from that which came after its previous meeting.  Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the Fed probably calculated that, having surprised the market with its statement after its last decision, there was no point in making minor changes that risked mis-communication for a second consecutive meeting.  ""While the statement is hardly a surprise, merely getting past the FOMC date removes a minor element of uncertainty and frees the market to even more actively embrace risk,"" he said.  The dollar was flat at Dollars 1.3540 against the euro by mid-afternoon in New York.  Analysts said caution before today's interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England were also helping to subdue activity.  The ECB was widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 3.75 per cent and signal a 25 basis point rise in June. A 25bp rise in UK interest rates to 5.5 per cent has been fully priced into the market.  There has been speculation that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee could raise rates by 50bp as it battles to bring consumer price inflation back towards its 2 per cent target.  Ian Gunner, at Mellon Financial, said that the market was nervous about the outcome of the BoE's decision, especially since the MPC would have access to UK consumer price inflation data for April, due for release next week.  ""It would take something remarkably strong to move them into employing the shock treatment of a 50 basis point move, especially with the CPI rate set to head substantially lower from May onwards,"" he said.  ""The pound will retain support until this meeting is out of the way, but if only 25 basis points is delivered, sterling will most probably fall back.""  The pound rose 0.4 per cent to Pounds 0.6782 against the euro and climbed 0.4 per cent to Dollars 1.9975 against the dollar. The yen edged 0.2 per cent higher against the dollar to Y119.75 and climbed 0.2 per cent to Y162.24 against the euro, consolidating Tuesday's strong gains against the single currency.  Gavin Friend, strategist at Commerzbank, said it seemed reasonable to assume that some long-term accounts trimmed short yen positions before a hearing on currency manipulation in the US Congress.  "
114,2007-05-09,2007-05-10,Financial Times,Fed holds rates but reiterates inflation concerns.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday made very few changes to its policy statement, keeping rates on hold at 5.25 per cent and reiterating that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected"".  The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee again described core inflation as ""somewhat elevated"" - in spite of the dip in core inflation on its preferred measure in March to 2.1 per cent year on year.  This description will disappoint some investors, who were looking to the Fed to hint that the risks of inflation remaining at an uncomfortably high level have receded since the previous policy meeting in late March.  Equities traded broadly flat after the Fed's announcement, while the dollar edged up a fraction against the euro, with traders citing a reduced likelihood of early rate cuts.  Futures markets priced in a slightly reduced chance of rate cuts at subsequent meetings this year, with the market now assuming only a single rate cut by year end.  The FOMC did acknowledge that ""economic growth slowed in the first part of this year"" and that the adjustment in housing was ""ongoing"".  But it reiterated its view that ""nevertheless, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters"". 'Moderate pace' in the Fed's lexicon appears to mean growth of roughly 2 per cent.  The statement seems consistent with a policy of keeping interest rates on hold for some time. As at the prior meeting, though, the Fed implicitly signalled that it was concerned about growth as well as inflation.  It said ""future policy adjustments"" - by implication, interest rate moves in either direction - ""will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth"".  The statement was, on balance, slightly more hawkish than most economists were expecting.  It did not acknowledge any increased risk from housing in the light of early data from the spring selling season, nor did it suggest that inflation concerns had been substantially moderated by a combination of March's softer inflation report and April's weaker payrolls gain.  Policymakers are likely to want to see more evidence of moderating inflation and softer jobs growth before shifting to a neutral policy stance.  "
115,2007-05-09,2007-05-10,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall St poised for lower start as retailers slide.,"Wall Street stocks were set for a lower start on Thursday, after the majority of retailers missed their sales targets in April.  Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were down 3.6 points at 1,512, while Nasdaq futures were down 5.2 points at 1,907.  Fair value for the S&P 500 is 1,516.13 and 1,914.44 for the Nasdaq.  Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 33 points at 13,351.  Major retailers started reporting their same store sales figures for April on Thursday, and of the 45 retailers who had reported sales, 36 had missed their estimates.  Wal-Mart led the way with a sales decline of -3.5 per cent last month and in pre-market trade, its shares were down 1.4 per cent at $47.26.  ""This is the lowest comparison for the company, from when we started collecting Wal -Mart comparisons in January 1995,"" said Thomson.  JC Penney and Federated Department Stores reported worse than expected sales , with declines of 2.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Shares in JC Penney were down 1.6 per cent at $77, while Federated fell 1.8 per cent to $43.05 in pre-market activity.  In contrast, Costco beat estimates as it delivered a 7 per cent rise in comparable store sales. Its shares were up 1.8 per cent at $55.95.  Thomson said prospects for May were looking better: ""Most retailers have missed expectation and blamed the Easter effect and unfavourable weather. However, the majority indicated stronger sales towards the end of the month when weather improved.""  In earnings news, Whole Foods first quarter profits fell 11 per cent and missed estimates amid slowing sales growth and rising costs. Shares in the the organic foods retailer were 11.7 per cent lower at $40.35.  Viacom said first-quarter net income fell 36 per cent, amid higher production and restructuring costs.  The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates steady yet still flag up concerns over inflation, sparked a brief bout of selling in stocks on Wednesday, but the market quickly recovered.  US bond prices were a little firmer early on Thursday after weekly jobless claims and the March trade figures.  The yield on the 10-year bond was 0.7 basis points lower at 4.662 per cent.  The dollar was 0.15 per cent firmer versus the euro at $1.3508, after the European Central Bank left rates steady. ECB President Trichet said the bank would maintain ""strong vigilance"" over price pressures in the coming months and that briefly pushed the euro to a high of $1.3564.  Stocks rose on Wednesday after the after the FOMC meeting. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,512.58, led by gains in telecom, industrial and financial stocks. The index is nearing its March 2000 record close of 1,527.46.  The Nasdaq Composite pared losses after the FOMC meeting and closed up 0.2 per cent at at 2,576.34.  Blue-chips benefited from the FOMC outcome and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to a new record close of 13,362.87. The Russell 2000 Index of small companies also set a new high of 834.63 on Wednesday.  "
116,1991-10-01,1991-10-02,Financial Times,Leading Indicators Point To Weak Economy.,"The US composite index of leading indicators failed to rise in August, signalling possible future weakness in the US economy, the Commerce Department said yesterday. A separate report by purchasing managers indicated manufacturing industry continued to expand in September, but at a slower pace than earlier in the summer. The figures, suggesting a mixed economic outlook, were released as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the US central bank's policy-making committee, met to discuss interest rate policy. The committee was expected to lean towards further easing of monetary policy, but its deliberations will not be made public for six weeks. The index of leading indicators was flat in August after steady gains in the preceding six months. Six of its 11 components signalled contraction, including orders for plant and equipment, claims for unemployment insurance and real money supply. Taken together, the behaviour of the indicators supports the view that the economic recovery faltered in late summer, but it does not yet suggest an economic relapse.

117,1991-10-01,1991-10-02,Financial Times,US indicators point to weak economy: White House economists urge new measures to ease 'credit crunch',"THE US composite index of leading indicators failed to rise in August, signalling possible future weakness in the US economy, the Commerce Department said yesterday. A separate report by purchasing managers indicated manufacturing industry continued to expand in September, but at a slower pace than earlier in the summer. The figures, suggesting a mixed economic outlook, were released as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the US central bank's policy-making committee, met to discuss interest rate policy. The committee was expected to lean towards further easing of monetary policy, but its deliberations will not be made public for six weeks. The index of leading indicators was flat in August after steady gains in the preceding six months. Six of its 11 components signalled contraction, including orders for plant and equipment, claims for unemployment insurance and real money supply. An index of coincident indicators - designed to measure current economic conditions - fell slightly and has shown no growth since June. Taken together, the behaviour of the indicators supports the view that the economic recovery faltered in late summer, but it does not yet suggest an economic relapse. The purchasing managers' index, a closely watched measure of manufacturing health, rose to 55 per cent last month, compared with 54.8 per cent in August. The increase was smaller than in recent months but indicates that prospects in manufacturing remain brighter than in the larger services sector. The index has been above 50 per cent - the level that indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding - for four months. Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said the economy 'seemingly paused to catch its breath' last month. However, the fifth consecutive monthly increase in new orders indicated 'moderate growth' in the final quarter of this year. Yesterday's figures and FOMC meeting follow high level discussions between Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and the White House. Administration economists are urging new measures to alleviate the alleged 'credit crunch' - artificial restrictions on the supply of credit due to the weakness of the banking system - which is seen as inhibiting economic recovery. One option being considered is to relax bank capital requirements slightly to stimulate fresh lending. Economists are split over the importance of credit restrictions. The Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of monetarist economists formed to second-guess official monetary policy, says the economy is on track for 2-3 per cent growth and does not require additional stimulus. Prof Allan Meltzer, the group's leader, says the credit crunch is a 'red herring'. Bankers are applying tighter lending standards in weak sectors. But weak credit growth generally reflects weak demand, normal at this stage of the business cycle. "
118,1992-05-19,1992-05-20,Financial Times,Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on housing starts,"THE DOLLAR sank to a new three-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday on news of a bigger than expected monthly drop of 17 per cent in US housing starts for April, writes James Blitz. The US unit was trading at a low of DM1.5865 shortly after lunchtime in European markets, as dealers feared that the sharpest monthly fall in housing starts for eight years would force the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. When the rate cut failed to materialise at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the dollar regained some ground and closed in London 1/2 pfennig down at DM1.5905. Dealers said the dollar had been propped up by heavy bidding just below DM1.59 by two large German institutions and life insurance companies in Tokyo. In New York it ended at DM1.5903/10. However, analysts believe the case for a cut is much stronger following the housing figures, and could come today, when the FOMC meets again. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The balance of probabilities is for the Fed easing.' He does not believe that the dollar weakness will last but thinks the currency could yet bottom out at DM1.56. The dollar also lost ground yesterday morning to the yen on news that Japanese machine orders for March were up 14.6 per cent from the previous month. The figure brought a strong reaction from the markets, coming one day after news that the Japanese trade surplus in April was 13.4 per cent higher than for the previous month. However, the Fed's decision not to cut rates gave the US currency a temporary respite and it ended a little firmer at Y129.10, and later closed in New York at Y129.12. The D-Mark continued to perform strongly in the wake of Monday's news that a large industrial strike had been avoided. Its best gain was against the French franc as traders took profits following last week's bullish performance by the French currency. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3634, up about 1/2 franc. Sterling's recent rise against the D-Mark also seems to have petered out as traders give up hope that the pound might cross its central rate against the German currency. The pound closed 1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9250. One London dealer suggested that the pound's decline against the D-Mark may have been due to profit-taking in sterling/dollar trading, after the UK currency reached a high point of Dollars 1.8425 in London yesterday. The Swiss franc made new gains following Switzerland's decision to formally apply for EC membership. The Swiss currency ended about 1/2 centime stronger against the dollar at SFr1.4600. "
119,2004-03-16,2004-03-17,Financial Times,Federal Reserve keeps interest rates on hold.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday left interest rates on hold and kept its accompanying statement almost unchanged, a sign that the Federal funds rate is likely to remain at 1 per cent for several months to come. In the only significant change, the Fed's open market committee said that ""although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged"". Following its January meeting the committee said: ""Although hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labour market"". The slight downgrading of the Fed's assessment of labour market conditions follows February's disappointing employment report, which showed that the US economy added just 21,000 new jobs last month. The committee reiterated that with inflation quite low and resource use slack, it believed it could be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"". Investors had expected no change in interest rates and few economists had expected a change in the language of the committee's statement, other than a tweak to employment assessment. Immediately following the meeting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell six basis points to 3.71 per cent. While employment conditions remain weak, economists expect the Fed rate to remain on hold. Following the February employment report, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes had dropped from above 4 per cent to below 3.8 per cent at present. Federal Reserve officials have indicated that the risk of the US economy slipping into deflation is no longer seen as a serious threat. However, the committee maintained its judgment that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished and appears ""almost equal"" to that of a rise in inflation. It also maintained the judgment that the risks to attaining sustainable growth over the next few quarters are ""roughly equal"". In the other change, the FOMC said the data since its last meeting ""indicate that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace"". Fed officials believe its commitment to be patient has helped hold down long-term interest rates, without tying the committee's hands as might have been the case with its previous formulation that policy accommodation can be maintained for a ""considerable period"". Investors saw the FOMC as inching closer to the start of the tightening cycle when it dropped the considerable period language at its last meeting, and said in December that the risks that the US could slip into deflation had diminished. The economic data have changed little since the Fed's last meeting, with healthy growth in consumer spending and business investment. Industrial output growth was stronger than expected last month, helped partly by the weak dollar. The labour market still disappoints. The Federal Reserve first referred to policy being ""accommodative"" at the start of 2002, when the Fed funds rate was at 1.75 per cent. "
120,1996-07-03,1996-07-04,Financial Times,ROADSHOW GETS UNDER WAY FOR ASSET-BACKED LAUNCH.,"The underwriters of the forthcoming FFr 40bn issue of asset-backed floating-rate bonds for Cyber-Val 07-96 - the largest-ever international bond offering - yesterday were busy preparing its launch next week. An investor presentation in Paris today will kick off a European roadshow covering Dublin, Brussels, Zurich, Geneva, London and Frankfurt. The deal highlights the growing receptiveness of European investors to buy asset-backed securities, which has spurred the launch of several securitised deals denominated in European currencies in recent months. The Cyber-Val issue will be backed by one third of the loan made by Credit Lyonnais to EPFR, a vehicle set up and guaranteed by the French state as part of the bank's restructuring package approved last year. The transaction, which will be lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, is set to be launched around the middle of next week. It will consist of four tranches: a FFr 8bn one-year portion expected to be priced between 1 basis point below and 1 basis point above three-month Pibor; a FFr 8bn two-year tranche at between 1 and 3 basis points over Pibor; a FFr 8bn three-year tranche yielding between 4 and 6 basis points over Pibor and a FFr 16bn five-year tranche which pays back FFr 8bn at the end of the fourth year, set to yield between 7 and 9 basis points over Pibor. The issue is expected to obtain a triple-A credit rating. While the short tranches will be aimed at French institutions, the longer-dated bonds will be aimed at investors - banks, funds and corporates - across Europe. The bonds will be zero-risk weighted in France, and some dealers were speculating other countries might follow suit since bonds recently issued by Cades, the French agency set up to manage the country's social security debts, have been accorded a zero-risk weighting in the UK and Germany. Elsewhere, the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and today's US Independence Day holiday caused issuance to slow to a trickle. With institutional investors lying low, retail-targeted, high-yielding bonds were one of the main themes of the day. In the South African rand sector, the World Bank issued R200m of 13 5/8%, three-year bonds via Hambros Bank and Deutsche Bank Finance launched R200m of 14%, five-year bonds led by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The paper was aimed mainly at yield-hungry retail investors in Germany and Switzerland. The South African market has begun to shake off the currency crisis that sent bond yields soaring earlier this year; the rand is now back in a range of R4.30 to R4.35 against the dollar and South Africa's 10-year benchmark government bond now yields 14.88%, down from 15.5% about two months ago. The European Investment Bank meanwhile made its debut in the Czech Koruna market with Kc1.5bn of 10 3/4%, three-year bonds via Wood Commerz, a Prague-based joint venture between Germany's Commerzbank and a local brokerage - the first koruna bond underwritten by a domestic institution.

121,1996-07-03,1996-07-04,Financial Times,ITALIAN FUTURES JUMP ON MOODY'S UPGRADING.,"Most European bond markets traded quietly in a tight range while the US Fed's FOMC meeting was taking place. However prices of Italian BTP futures surged in late afternoon when Moody's, the US credit rating agency, announced an upgrade of Italy's domestic and foreign currency sovereign rating to Aa3, from A1. September BTP futures jumped to a high of 117.40 on APT, Liffe's after-hours screen-based trading system, after having settled at 116.83, up 0.01. In the cash market, the 9 1/2% BTP due 2006 was 0.04 higher at 101.86 at the official close, its yield spread over bunds 1 basis point tighter at 287. Final inflation data for June is due to be released tomorrow, and market participants expect a rate cut by the Bank of Italy to follow. * German bunds were supported by encouraging economic data and bullish comments by Mr Ernst Welteke, a member of the Bundesbank's council. Liffe's September bund future settled at 95.50, down 0.03, but off the day's low. Industrial production rose by 1% month-on-month in May, which made economists at HSBC Markets confident that ""the real economy is on the mend"". Analysts at UBS in Frankfurt concurred, adding that against a background of subdued inflation they expect ""the Bundesbank will help keep the momentum going with further modest reductions in the repurchase rate"". This view was echoed by Mr Welteke, who predicted a decline in M3 money supply and said there was still room to ""further lower the repo rate"". * Trading in UK gilts was subdued. The market was kept in check by the Fed's FOMC meeting as well as by the policy meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England. Liffe's September long gilt future traded in a narrow range of 106 5/16 -106 9/16 before settling at 106 11/32, down 3/16. The volume of transactions, approximately 28,000 contracts, was less than half the 60,000 average of a ""normal"" session. In the cash market, the 10-year benchmark gilt closed at 96 15/16, down 5/32. After last week's rally, traders have adopted a ""safety first attitude"", said Mr Andrew Roberts, a bond analyst at UBS. ""Gilts have appreciated both in absolute terms and relative to bunds, so there is little incentive to adopt aggressive strategies"". Mr Roberts predicts the 10-year spread over bunds will soon reach 150 basis points, against 155 yesterday. * Spanish bonds closed lower, but the positive market sentiment seemed intact. The September futures contract on 10-year bonos settled at 100.44, down 0.33. In the cash market, the benchmark 8.8% bond 2006 was 0.43 lower at 99.46, its yield spread over bunds 5 basis points wider at 232. An auction of 5-and 15-year bonds was well bid, with yields falling by 28 and 35 basis points respectively from the levels of the previous auction. * French OATs traded in line with bunds. Matif's September notional future closed at 121.76, down 0.06. In the cash market, the 10-year OAT yield was 4 basis points below that of the equivalent bund, compared with 3 basis points on Tuesday. * US Treasury bonds posted gains yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting without raising interest rates. The benchmark 30-year Treasury traded lower through the morning and then rallied as much as a quarter point on reports that the Fed had left rates unchanged. By late in the session, however, the long bond was off its session highs with a gain of 1/8 at 88 11/32 to yield 6.926%. At the short end of the maturity spectrum, the two-year note was 3/32 stronger at 100 5/32, yielding 6.148%. The September 30-year bond slipped 3/16 to 109 1/4. Most economists believed that the Fed would leave interest rates unchanged, but earlier this week some stronger-than-expected data on business activity in June and new home sales in May threw some uncertainty into the discussion. Longer-term interest rates have barely budged since bonds rallied late last week after weak data led to speculation that the Fed would leave monetary policy unchanged. In the wake of the decision by the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged the market's focus moved to tomorrow's release of non-farm payroll figures for clues about whether the central bank might tighten later this summer. Mr Richard Gilhooly, an international bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York said bonds would probably rally if the jobs figure came in at or below the 150,000 analysts were expecting. The market will be closed today for Independence Day and will be open for a half-day tomorrow. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. "

123,1996-07-03,1996-07-04,Financial Times,YELTSIN HEALTH FACTOR STARTS TO CONCERN MARKETS.,"MARKETS REPORT: Foreign exchanges were fairly quiet yesterday as markets waited for the US Federal Reserve to announce the outcome of its two-day policy meeting. A measure of concern, however, did enter the markets about the health of President Yeltsin. Although exit polls suggested he would triumph in the presidential election, the uncertain state of his health has focused markets on who, or what, might follow him. The dollar finished little changed in London at DM 1.5252 from DM 1.5270. Against the yen it closed at Y 110.570 from Y 110.140. The Yeltsin worries contributed to D-Mark weakness in the morning, which saw the French franc dip below FFr 3.3799 and the Swiss franc rally to 81.87 centimes before finishing at 82.3 centimes. The early poll results suggesting President Yeltsin would triumph over his Communist challenger helped arrest the slide in the D-Mark, contributing to a weaker dollar in the US afternoon. The dollar was trading at DM 1.5222 and Y 110.35 in mid-afternoon New York trading before the Fed's meeting finished. Sterling was little changed, closing at DM 2.3777 and $1.5590 from DM 2.3762 and $1.5562. A late development was the news that the debt rating agency Moody's had upgraded Italy's rating. This saw the lira rally from a London close of L1,006 to L1,003 two hours later. Analysts said the enhanced appeal of Italian assets could well be sufficient to push the lira back through L1,000 against the D-Mark. * So far as the dollar was concerned, the FOMC meeting and Russia were the two events which dominated market thinking. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the market had become increasingly nervous about the prospect of US rates rising, especially after some strong data this week. He said the odds had probably shifted from 80:20 against to only 55:45 against, especially in the light of the strong purchasing managers survey, and new homes sales well above market expectations. Those who though the Fed might tighten used these data to support their case. Those who thought they would hold off invoked the authority of unnamed Fed officials who, a few weeks ago, said the Fed would not tighten policy until there were definite signs of inflation picking up. Mr Hawkins said the health of President Yeltsin had now become an issue in the market. ""Even if he does win, how long is he going to be there and who will succeed him?"" He said this issue looked likely to act as a medium-term ""D-Mark negative"". A side note to these issues was the performance of the Swiss franc. Although it was the beneficiary of the early D-Mark weakness, there were also reports out of New York of a large purchase of D-Marks against the franc. One analyst said this probably reflected the growing perception that the Swiss economy was the weakest in Europe - arguably one headed for a currency devaluation in the same way that the yen and D-Mark have lost ground over the past year. The yen itself slipped back on news that Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential Ministry of Finance official associated with a ""strong dollar"" policy, will be staying in his job. * The recent rally in sterling has forced analysts to re-do their sums. Yesterday Goldman Sachs announced that it had revised its forecast higher against the D-Mark on the basis that the Labour party ""pro-EMU"" argument is likely to enjoy increasing weight in the market. Goldman is now forecasting DM 2.45 instead of DM 2.35 in six months time. Mr David DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange at Swiss Bank in New York, offers two possible reasons for sterling strength: * ""the speculative money wants to be short the yen and long somewhere else that has more kick on the upside than the dollar."" * ""a side bet on oil with the pound"". Mr DeRosa believes that the Likud victory in the Israeli elections has boosted Arab solidarity and hence the Arab bloc within Opec. This could favour a stronger oil price, which would help sterling as the UK is an oil producer. (In fact the benchmark price of oil is about 30 cents/barrel higher over the past month).

124,1994-12-20,1994-12-21,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW EASIER FOLLOWING FOMC NEWS.,"Wall Street US equities fluctuated in negative territory yesterday, showing little reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates at its open market committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.55 lower at 3,767.15. The more broadly based Standard &Poor's 500 lost 0.59 at 457.32 and the American Stock Exchange composite eased 0.43 to 425.30, but the Nasdaq composite improved 0.62 to 728.51. New York SE volume was a substantial 327m shares. The Dow moved up near to Monday's closing level just after a spokesman for the Federal Reserve said the meeting had adjourned with no announcement, but proved unable to sustain that level. Few on Wall Street expected another interest rate increase, but the market was jittery all morning as investors waited for some official word. There was some speculation that the Fed might raise rates as much as 50 basis points. So far this year, the Fed has tightened six times, bringing the rate to 5 1/2%, from 3% in January. Reaction was muted to news that the trade deficit for October widened to $10.14bn from a revised September figure of $9.35bn. Although the trade deficit continues to grow, the October figure was generally in line with economists' forecasts. Several important announcements in the high technology sector moved share prices yesterday. Microsoft, which trades on the Nasdaq, dropped $3 5/8 to $59 after the software maker announced that a new computer operating system may not be available until August of next year. Intel advanced $3 3/8 to $61 1/4 after the company said it would replace Pentium chips on demand. Intel shares had been under pressure in the wake of growing publicity surrounding a flaw in the chip. Also benefiting from Intel's announcement were computer makers Gateway 2000 and Dell Computer, which are among the primary users of the Pentium chip. Just after Intel's announcement, Gateway said it would broaden the lifetime warranty on all of its Pentium-based computers. Its shares were unchanged at $22 1/2. Dell was up $1 at $38 3/4. Other technology shares were mixed. Hewlett-Packard rose $2 1/4 to $97 3/8, while IBM shed $7/8 to $70 3/4 and Apple Computer dipped $1/4 to $38 1/2. Monsanto fell $4 to $68 7/8 after the chemical company agreed to buy a specialty chemicals business from Merck. An analyst at PaineWebber, the broking house, downgraded the company, saying the agreement created the impression that Monsanto was not focusing on cutting costs. Merck put on $1/2 at $38 5/8. American Depository Receipts of Glaxo Holdings gained $3/4 at $20 1/2 after the drugs maker announced that it believed recent Gatt-related changes to US law would allow for the extension of the patent on its ulcer drug Zantac in the US. The announcement pushed up Bristol-Myers Squibb, which also faces uncertainty regarding a patent expiration. The stock rose $1 3/8 to $59 1/2. Telmex lost nearly 5% after the Mexican government announced that it was widening the band in which the peso trades against the dollar. ADRs of the Mexican telephone monopoly fell $2 3/8 to $46 1/8. Canada Golds led a firmer trend in Toronto which lifted the TSE 300 composite index 17.38 to 4,154.13, in spite of continued weakness in New York. Rising issues outpaced declines by 441 to 374 after volume of 72.3m shares. Eleven of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by communication, gold, real estate and paper stocks. The metal, oil and pipelines sectors posted declines. The golds group added 1.42% as the New York spot bullion price gained $2.50 at $382.25 an ounce. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
125,1994-12-20,1994-12-21,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR STEADY AS FOMC LEAVES RATES UNCHANGED.,"The dollar yesterday showed little response to the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave US interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith. The decision had been expected, but the chance of a surprise monetary tightening had left traders cautious ahead of the meeting. The US currency closed in London at DM 1.5720, from DM 1.5738, and at Y 100.13 from Y 100.155. Soon after the meeting finished, around 19.15 GMT, the dollar was trading at DM 1.57. It ended in New York at DM 1.5701 and Y 100.17. The main excitement came from Mexico, where the government sanctioned a 15% devaluation of the peso. The upper limit of the peso's trading band against the dollar was raised by 53 centavos. The daily rate at which the peso is permitted to slide against the dollar, equivalent to 4.3% in a year, was maintained after the devaluation. The peso finished in London at 3.885 against the dollar, 12% down from Monday's close of 3.4647. In Europe the lira remained the main focus, ahead of the no confidence vote later this week. It touched a record low of L1,049.80 against the D-Mark, but the market shied away from pushing it through the L1,050 barrier. Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade-weighted index ending unchanged at 80.3. The decision to devalue the peso was taken by members of the Pact for Well-Being, Stability and Growth. They include government, business, labour and campesino leaders. The Pact said the decision to allow the peso to slide was taken in response to rebel threats in the Chiapas region that have recently unsettled Mexican financial markets. A growing current account deficit, however, provides an economic explanation for currency weakness. Before yesterday's move, some observers had considered the peso overvalued, in spite of having fallen by more than 10% against the dollar during the year. Mexico's current account deficit is expected to widen to about $28bn this year, more than 7% of gross domestic product. With capital flows insufficient to finance the deficit, reserves have fallen by about $10bn since February, and short-term interest rates have risen above 14%, more than 7% in real terms. Some economists argued that for interest rates to come down and economic growth to accelerate, above the 3% expected for this year, a devaluation was necessary. Until yesterday, the government had been opposed to a devaluation, arguing that interest rates would still rise, to quell concerns about imported inflation, while Mexican companies with large foreign currency loans would suffer heavy losses. Last week Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, said the peso would be defended with higher interest rates, at the expense of 1995 growth targets. The bellwether interest rate on the 91-day tesobono, a dollar-denominated money market instrument, rose after the announcement by 88 basis points to 8.28%. The Pact said, however, that Mexico would be able to meet its economic goals in 1995, particularly that of price stability, supply and economic growth. The dollar showed little response to the release of October trade figures, in spite of a widening in the bilateral deficit with Japan. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, analysts said the dollar had limited downside if interest rates were kept on hold. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said investors were expecting the dollar to move higher in 1995. After meeting recently with a cross-section of the firm's US clients, he said he 'did not come across anybody who was bearish on the dollar'. His view that the dollar would reach DM 1.65/70 next year, possibly in the first quarter, 'seemed to be generally accepted'. Mr MacKinnon added that rising German interest rates - he expects the first upward move in the first quarter of 1995 - would cap the dollar's progress. He said it was also his impression that the Bundesbank did not like the D-Mark slipping through the DM 1.70 level against the dollar. The Bank of England cleared an #850m money market shortage, mostly through late assistance. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
126,1994-12-20,1994-12-21,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - ATTENTION TURNS TO ITALIAN SCENE.,"Most European bond markets ended a lethargic session little changed. Even in Italy, where political problems continued to simmer, prices were little changed in quiet dealings ahead of crucial confidence votes in parliament, expected this week. 'This could be the lull before the storm,' said one dealer. In a move to steal his opponents' thunder, Italian prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi signalled his intention to seek a parliamentary vote of confidence in his government expected as early as today. Although Mr Berlusconi's government already faces motions for three no-confidence votes, a cabinet spokesman said that under Italy's constitution a motion for a confidence vote takes precedence over a no-confidence vote. If Mr Berlusconi loses the vote and resigns, he would demand immediate elections, the spokesman said. Many observers said that if the government loses the vote - which is seen as increasingly likely - the president might set up an interim 'institutional government' to restore political calm. Ultimately, however, 'another general election is likely in the spring, irrespective of whether Berlusconi survives the vote or an institutional government is established,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at HSBC Markets. The market shrugged off the final approval by the lower house of Italy's parliament to the 1995 budget, which now becomes law. The budget, consisting of three separate items of legislation, aims to reduce next year's deficit by L48,000bn to L138,600bn. The March BTP futures contract on Liffe ended at 98.99, down 0.01 point on the day. German government bonds ended a lacklustre session little changed in spite of lower-than-expected money supply data. Annualised M3 growth fell to 6% - the top of the Bundesbank's target range - in November, from 6.8% in October. The market also shrugged off the Bundesbank's announcement of a 10-year bund issue planned for December 28 and 29 - the government's traditional New Year bond. Some were disappointed that Bonn was not issuing a 30-year bond. 'The Finance Ministry said last year that they would issue at least one 30-year bond each year, but they haven't,' said a Frankfurt dealer, adding: 'The market needs fresh 30-year supply to keep the long end liquid.' The 10-year March bund future on Liffe closed at 89.65, down 0.05 point. UK gilts ended a slow day slightly weaker on thin volume. Prices softened slightly on strong M4 lending data for November, but dealers reported little trading activity. 'People are mainly tying up loose ends and closing their books,' said one trader. However, another dealer reported some demand for index-linked gilts, which rose by about 1/4 point. The March long gilt future on Liffe ended at 102 3/16, down 1/8 point. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve's open market committee ended its last meeting of the year without taking any action. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/32 at 95 31/32 yielding 7.845%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up 1/16 at 99 7/16, yielding 7.545%. As the FOMC meeting began, most analysts discounted the chances of another interest rate increase. Still, some economists had said they thought the Fed might boost rates as much as 50 basis points, and the market was skittish all morning as the committee met in private. Prices hardly moved after a spokesman for the Fed said the FOMC meeting had adjourned and there would be no statement. Since the last FOMC meeting, the yield spread between two-year and 30-year bonds narrowed as the market became convinced that the Fed's tightening would restrain the robust economy. Over the past week it widened slightly after mild inflation figures led investors to bet against a rate increase in December. Release of the October trade figures drew only muted reaction. The Commerce Department reported the trade deficit widened to $10.1bn from a revised September figure of $9.35bn. In spite of the increase in the trade deficit, the market held steady as the figure was well within the range of consensus estimates. Also, a steady dollar helped stabilise the bond market.

127,1994-12-20,1994-12-21,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - TAKEOVER TALK HELPS DRIVE FOOTSIE TOWARDS 3,100 - MARKET REPORT.","Takeover stories, actual and rumour-based, continued to dominate the UK equity market yesterday with news of De La Rue's #682m bid for Portals, and the prospect of many more bids and mergers in coming months, overriding the market's fundamental concerns over the short term prospects for domestic and international interest rates. As the London market closed, no hard news had emerged from the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting held to discuss monetary policy, although Wall Street was under renewed pressure for much of the afternoon and down over 20 points an hour after London closing. The feeling remained in both Europe and the US that the Federal Reserve would want to examine all the economic evidence from the fourth quarter before it moved to increase its interest rates so soon after the last move. That took place in mid-November when the Fed increased its Fed Funds rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2%. On top of the previous session's 16-point fall, dealers said the latest weakness had produced some tremors around UK dealing desks during the last two hours of trading. But the general consensus among traders was that London would probably wind down for the Christmas holiday in good form, given no shift in US interest rates. Helping to sustain all European equity and bond markets was more good news on inflation and money supply from Germany. Germany's M3 money supply grew by an annualised 6% in the year to end-November, much better than the consensus forecast of 6.3% and the annualised 6.9% for the year to end-October. Inflation figures for November from Bavaria were also seen as bullish for markets. 'The German numbers were very good for the markets, well within target ranges,' said the head trader at one of the leading European banks in London. He added that London's equity market would take heart from any strength in Euro bourses, especially Frankfurt. The Bundesbank Council meets in Frankfurt tomorrow to decide the course of German interest rates. By the close of trading the FT-SE 100 index had risen a further 23.7 to 3,058.1, its highest level since the end of November and a rise of 114.7, or 3.9% since December 12 when the market was reeling from a combination of political and economic worries. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was left behind by its senior index, closing only 3.7 higher at 3,463.7. Earlier, the market had begunon a quiet note, mindful of the overnight fall on Wall Street. Down 3.9 at the outset the FT-SE 100 index quickly rallied as news of the De La Rue bid for Portals - at a much higher than expected price - and other potential bids hit the market. Helping the market move ahead was a #30m-plus programme trade which was said to have been weighted on the buy side and executed by UBS. Turnover, boosted by the UBS programme trade, increased to a highly respectable 798.4m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing almost 66% of that figure. Customer business on Monday was worth #1.275bn. De La Rue, although feeding the market's takeover appetite with its agreed offer for Portals, suffered from the view that the company was paying a full price for the paper manufacturer. The merchant banks and securities houses attracted yet another wave of strong buying interest as speculators continued to bet on a series of rationalisation moves in the UK securities business. Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court, both highly-rated and sizeable players in London markets, moved near their highest levels since February, when bond and equity markets began their interest rate driven descent.

128,1994-12-20,1994-12-21,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - POLITICS A MIXED BLESSING IN MILAN AND MADRID.,"Politics was a mixed blessing for bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. It kept Milan volatile, currently on the upside, and yet another strategist, Mr Jerry Evans at Kleinwort Benson, said that political concerns were overdone and that Italian equities offered solid value. But political developments continued to depress Madrid. MILAN continued to forge ahead with the weak lira, at an all-time low against the D-Mark, offering an apparent bonus to foreign investors. The Comit index rose 5.65 to 612.91. Analysts commented that the market was looking beyond the political chaos surrounding Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, and hoping that it would soon be replaced by a caretaker institutional administration, with a prime minister selected from outside the political parties. Blue chips were broadly higher. Fiat which set the pace early in the day finished L54 higher at L5,849, off a high of L5,885. Telecom Italia, under pressure recently over the concessions that it pays to the government on its mobile telephones, rebounded L120 or 3.0% to L4,095. Credito Italiano picked up L16 to L1,660, with no takers seen for its Credito Romagnolo bid, but a fresh offer still not ruled out. Rolo finished L66 down at L18,850. MADRID, already depressed about the political future of its prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, dropped again after Monday's detention of a former state security chief in connection with anti-Eta undercover operations in the 1980s. The general index fell 2.91 to 293.46. Banesto dropped another Pta27 to Pta929 after an intraday low of Pta904 as its former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, resumed his high court testimony related to criminal charges filed last week. FRANKFURT recovered some of Monday's post bourse losses in the morning, but it could go no further in the afternoon as the Ibis indicated Dax ended at 2,080.16, up 13.57 after a session close of 2,079.93. Turnover fell from DM 5.2bn to DM 4.5bn. Dealers said that the market was waiting to hear the result of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington, although the Fed was not actually expected to act on US interest rates this week. There were contrasts in automotive stocks. BMW continued to rise, although analysts had said that its supply contract with Rolls Royce was a boost to sentiment, rather than BMW profits on any scale; the shares closed the afternoon another DM 12 ahead at DM 766; but Continental fell DM 3.10 to DM 218 after strength last week on a progress report from the tyremaker. PARIS moved in a narrow range as investors remained quiet ahead of events in the US. The CAC-40 index drifted down 3.37 to 1,924.72. Kleinwort Benson's French equity team remained neutral on the market, noting that in spite of a modest return of overseas institutions recently, upside was limited in the absence of the domestic investor and support from the bond market. In addition, the broker said, sentiment remained pressured by the overhanging privatisation programme, as well as political uncertainty ahead of April's presidential election. Danone rose FFr 4 to FFr 777, as the foods group took a controlling stake in Russia's biggest biscuit manufacturer. The acquisition fits in with the company's efforts to establish operations in emerging markets; it recently announced that it had taken a 50% stake in an Argentine biscuit producer. ZURICH was higher in low volume, supported by gains in Roche and UBS, and the SMI index rose 14.0 to 2,614.7. UBS bearers gained SwFr 18 to SwFr 1,078, with the bank again said to be a buyer of the stock. Roche certificates rose SwFr 55 to SwFr 6,190 and BBC was SwFr 13 higher at SwFr 1,120 amid indications that some foreign investors were raising their holdings of dollar sensitive stocks. Ascom was SwFr 50 ahead at SwFr 1,350 in further response to the weekend news that the group had a new chief executive. Hero, the food group, saw its bearers up SwFr 13 to SwFr 658 and the registered SwFr 5 higher to SwFr 175, extending Monday's sharp gain on rumours that it was to be acquired by Del Monte for an estimated SwFr 1bn. AMSTERDAM barely moved, the AEX index retreating 0.21 to 410.64. Hoogovens outperformed, up Fl 1.40 to Fl 75.80; brokers said that it was supported by local investors. KPN, rising 70 cents to Fl 58.60, got similar treatment ahead of its expected listing as a constituent of the blue chip index.

129,1994-12-20,1994-12-21,Financial Times,ARBITRAGE BUYING LIFTS NIKKEI FOR FIFTH DAY IN A ROW.,"World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific) - Arbitrage buying lifts Nikkei for fifth day in a row. Tokyo Arbitrage buying pushed share prices higher for the fifth consecutive trading day, as the rise of the Nikkei index above a technical resistance level cheered investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 136.13 to 19,406.98, having fluctuated between 19,193.64 and 19,417.88. Having lost ground in the morning on profit-taking, futures purchasing in the afternoon prompted index-linked buying, and the Nikkei's rise above 19,340, considered by traders as an important resistance level, prompted short-covering. Volume was 250m shares, against 254m. 'Most of the trading is still arbitrage linked, but some foreign investors are buying to cover their short positions ahead of the year-end,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Institutional investors remained absent ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting in the US. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 10.59 to 1,524.90, while the Nikkei 300 moved up 1.79 to 281.76. Advances led declines by 724 to 265, with 192 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 0.59 at 1,272.74. Overseas investors bought financials: Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y 30 apiece to Y 2,830 and Y 1,880 respectively. Brokers were also higher, with Nomura Securities adding Y 30 at Y 2,030. Reports of the popularity of new 32-bit electronic games lifted Sony Y 50 to Y 5,550. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker which has also recently introduced its new game hardware, climbed Y 110 to Y 5,750. But some high-technology issues lost ground on profit-taking: Fujitsu fell Y 7 to Y 970. Steel issues rallied on bargain hunting, having been sold off by overseas investors. NKK put on Y 5 at Y 274 and Nippon Steel Y 3 at Y 362. Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabrics manufacturer, lost Y 6 at Y 657 after fluctuating in speculative trading. Privatisation stocks were higher, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone up Y 5,000 to Y 844,000. Investors were encouraged by reports that the government had approved NTT's plan to lift basic subscription charges and directory assistance rates from February next year. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 118.91 to 21,045.85 in volume of 106.9m shares. Roundup The region was mixed, with many investors awaiting the outcome of yesterday's US FOMC meeting. HONG KONG reversed an early 99-point loss but trading was relatively thin ahead of the US rates decision. The Hang Seng index ended 88.99 ahead at 8,267.33, in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn, down from Monday's HKDollars 2.8bn. Brokers said that the late rally was fuelled by buy orders from Europe for Hang Seng index constituents. Overall market sentiment remained bearish and activity was subdued as many foreign fund managers had already closed their books for the year. Banks were the best performers, with the sub-index rising 2.1%. HSBC and Hang Seng Bank added HKDollars 1.50 each at HKDollars 83.75 and HKDollars 57. Bank of East Asia surged HKDollars 1.55 to HKDollars 30.80 on news that it will disclose its inner reserves. SEOUL remained worried about liquidity and the composite index dipped 4.63 to 1,023.99, a sixth consecutive decline. Brokers said that unfounded rumours that the government would soon scrap cash deposit requirements for institutional investors failed to boost blue chips before government officials denied that such a step was planned. Korea Mobile Telecom again went limit down, losing Won10,000 to Won443,000, and Samsung Electronics fell Won1,900 to Won107,000. KUALA LUMPUR reversed an easier morning trend to end higher, led by institutional buying of Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The composite index rose 8.94 to 966.19, although activity was subdued. Telekom advanced 40 cents to M$17.70 and Tenaga was up 30 cents at M$10.50. Pernas International added 38 cents at M$3.62 after its proposed one-for-two bonus issue was approved by the securities commission. TAIPEI lost Monday's gains on a bout of heavy profit-taking. The weighted index fell 1.8% or 130.02 to 6,925.28. Turnover was TDollars 104bn. The financial sector was the hardest hit, with ICBC falling TDollars 5.50 or 5% to TDollars 104.50 and Chang Hwa Bank down TDollars 10 or 4.8% to TDollars 198. Textiles were also weak, Chung Shing Textile slipping 40 cents to TDollars 21.40. Shinkong Synthetic Fibres went against the trend, appreciating TDollars 1.10 or 2.55% to TDollars 44.90. MANILA saw selective buying of heavily weighted stocks, including PLDT and San Miguel, which helped to lift the composite index 16.78 to 2,740.04. Turnover totalled a moderate 2.37bn pesos. Some brokers commented that many investors were taking positions in blue chips ahead of dividend declarations in the first two months of 1995. The commercial-industrial sector led advancing areas, gaining 17.61 at 4,037.17. SYDNEY was easier as it tracked the overnight performance of Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index was off 1.4 at 1,898.6 but after an intraday low of 1,890.8. Trading was modest, with shares valued at A$397m changing hands. Mining stocks were generally higher, however, with the exception of CRA, 2 cents softer at A$17.82. Banks were mixed, with NAB retreating 14 cents to A$10.30, mainly on options-linked deals, as Westpac rose 5 cents to A$4.33 and CBA 4 cents to A$8.17. BANGKOK picked up just before the close on late speculative buying in the finance sector. The SET index improved 14.90 to 1,352.68 in moderate turnover of Bt4.7bn. The finance sector rose 2.6%, with Phatra Thanakit firming Bt7 to Bt199. KARACHI plunged to a year's low on continuing worries about trouble and violence in the city. The KSE 100-share index shed 61.41 or 3% to 1,937.13. Declining issues led advances by 220 to 45. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
130,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS TO $10.3BN IN OCTOBER.,"The country's trade deficit improved by $0.4bn to $10.3bn in October, the Department of Commerce announced yesterday (14.12.88). Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Board issued figures showing that output and capacity pressures continue to rise sharply in the final quarter of the year, after a slack third quarter. All the figures were closely in line with market expectations, and the markets continued to drift while awaiting the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ended yesterday. The FOMC is considering statistics which suggest a high pressure of demand and activity, along with reports from member banks which paint a more subdued picture of the economy. The trade figures reflected falls in both imports and exports from their high September values, and the change in the balance was more than accounted for by a sharp rise in export deliveries of aircraft, always a volatile series. A major talking point yesterday was higher interest rates overseas. The Belgian and Dutch central banks moved key interest rates 1/4 point higher and there were widespread expectations that today's policy-making Bundesbank council meeting could decide on a rise in the key Lombard rate.

131,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,TREASURY BONDS DRIFT LOWER IN DULL TRADING AFTER LATEST US ECONOMIC DATA RELEASED.,"There were no surprises in yesterday's (14.12.88) batch of US economic data which were in line with expectations and left Treasury bonds drifting lower in dull trading. By the close, short-dated maturities were quoted around 1/16 point lower, medium-date issues were up to 1/8 point lower and long-dated issues slumped by as much as 3/4 point. Despite the relatively larger losses at the long end, the yield curve remained inverted with the yield on the 8.875 per cent 1990 issue at 9.155 per cent and the yield on the Treasury's benchmark long bond rising to 9.041 per cent. Although yesterday's figures were almost exactly as forecasters had predicted, the dollar slid on foreign exchanges which put some pressure on bonds. In late trading, the US currency was quoted at Y 122.65 compared with an early high of Y 123.45 and at DM 1.7385 from DM 1.7505 earlier. Yesterday's batch of figures confirmed that progress towards reducing the trade deficit is now very sluggish and that manufacturing production continues to be robust. It is still unclear, however, whether there is enough strength in the economy (and therefore a substantial enough threat of inflation) to push the discount rate higher. The Federal Open Market Committee ended its two-day meeting yesterday and the bond market will be focused on the Federal Reserve's money market operations over the next few weeks. Of more immediate concern will be the dollar's reaction to interest rate moves overseas amid expectations that the Bundesbank may raise its Lombard rate. Fed Funds yesterday closed at 8 1/2 per cent.

132,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,US Trade Deficit Narrows To 10.3 Billion Dollars In October,"The US trade deficit improved by dollars 0.4 bn to dollars 10.3 bn in October, the Department of Commerce announced yesterday. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Board issued figures showing that output and capacity pressures continue to rise sharply in the final quarter of the year, after a slack third quarter. All the figures were closely in line with market expectations, and the markets continued to drift while awaiting the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ended yesterday. The FOMC is considering statistics which suggest a high pressure of demand and activity, along with reports from member banks which paint a more subdued picture of the economy. The trade figures reflected falls in both imports and exports from their high September values, and the change in the balance was more than accounted for by a sharp rise in export deliveries of aircraft, always a volatile series. Other details showed the effects of high domestic demand; exports of chemicals and paper products, where capacity is under strain, fell sharply. On the import side there was a surge in shipments of manufactures, which rose dollars 2.2 bn from September and stood at dollars 2.8 bn above the monthly average for the first nine months of 1988. Such a surge was widely expected after earlier reports that wholesale and retail stocks had been reduced sharply in earlier months, in an effort to avoid the excess inventories which built up in the final quarter of 1987. The November industrial output figures from the Federal Reserve showed a volume increase of 0.5 per cent for the second successive month, with manufacturing output up 0.6 per cent. Capacity utilisation is reported to have risen to 84.2 per cent, the highest figures since 1983. This compares with 84 per cent in October and a revised 83.7 per cent in September. Yesterday's figures generally confirmed what the markets already knew about the economy: that progress in cutting the trade deficit is now very slow indeed and that manufacturing industry continues to produce at a healthy rate and is running at very high capacity levels. The economic releases did not give much strength to arguments either for or against a US discount rate rise and it was the dollar's weakness yesterday which prompted falls in stocks and bonds. The dollar closed at DM 1.73955 and at Y 122.70. Treasury bonds were as much as 3/4 point lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.25 lower at 2,134.24. A major talking point yesterday was higher interest rates overseas. The Belgian and Dutch central banks moved key interest rates 1/4 point higher and there were widespread expectations that today's policy-making Bundesbank council meeting could decide on a rise in the key Lombard rate. "
133,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,Government Bonds: Bank Auction Plan Cheers Dealers,"The UK government bond market put a positive initial interpretation on yesterday's announcement by the Bank of England that it would hold an experimental reverse auction in January, when it would undertake to buy back a maximum of 500 m pounds sterling of gilt-edged bonds from the short end of the yield curve. The two outstanding issues in question are 2.4 bn pounds sterling worth of 10 per cent Exchequer and 2 bn pounds sterling of 11 per cent Exchequer, both due 1989. The auction would be January 13, for settlement three days later. Corporate tax payments usually peak around this time, draining cash from the market. The Bank has been using repurchase facilities to inject the additional liquidity required; the reverse auction is effectively a repo without the buyback. There is not much precedent for central banking techniques of buying back government stock, a necessity forced on the Old Lady by the UK budget surplus. But market makers initially welcomed the experiment as a cleaner method of operating. Previously, the dealers had simply rung the Bank with offers of stock, and no one quite understood on what basis the issues were bought or refused. Now the bidding will be more in the open, although the Bank reserves the right to buy nothing if the market's pricing is too aggressive. Clearly the Bank of England sees a structural surplus continuing for a while. Participants interpreted this positively in terms of continuing artificially high support for prices. The implications for their job security in a shrinking market were another matter. Previously, the market had assumed the Bank would buy in stock primarily at the long end, but the move yesterday suggested purchases might be more evenly spread. Immediately afterwards, the short stocks through to about six-year maturities rose about 1/2 point on the news, whereas the long end was up 9/32 point or so, quickly falling back some 5/32. Thus the yield curve, which is steeply negative, flattened a little. After much consideration, the verdict was that the Bank's move was simply a technical adjustment. Yesterday was generally a bouncy day. Sterling weakness depressed morning prices, as the currency dipped below DM 3.18 by lunchtime. Gilts were then buffeted by a choppy US market, first cheered by predictable October trade numbers but quickly upset by higher capacity utilisation data which portends continuing strength in the US economy. A fall in UK industrial output was one of the few positive influences on the market, but not enough to prevent the benchmark 2002-2007 bond closing a full point down. * * * European talk was again of higher interest rates, as both the Dutch and Belgian central banks raised rates. German government bonds rose 15 basis points before yesterday's repurchase agreement, and up to a further 5 or 10 points afterwards, on the news that the Bundesbank had set rates between 5 and 5.5 per cent, in contrast with levels between 4.70 and 4.95 on the expiring facility. Although the amount of the repo was unexpected, the liquidity was necessary to meet cash needs for tax demands. There was little reaction by German bunds to US trade number. They finished the day roughly 15 basis points ahead. * * * Mr David Lange, New Zealand's Prime Minister who let slip in another context that he took no notice of markets, chose, probably unintentionally, the day the New Zealand Futures Exchange was closed to announce the sacking of Mr Roger Douglas, the Finance Minister. Markets fell sharply on the news that Mr Douglas's long-running dispute with Mr Lange had ended in dismissal, but sadly the automated, screen-based NZFE was shut because of a power workers' strike. Traders were thus unable to adjust their government bond book via futures, as the 5-year benchmark fell about their ears, and yields rose to 14.70 per cent from 14.14 before the news. The NZ dollar dropped 3 cents. * * * There were no surprises in yesterday's batch of US economic data which were in line with expectations and left Treasury bonds drifting lower in dull trading. By the close, short-dated maturities were quoted around 1/16 point lower, medium-date issues were up to 1/8 point lower and long-dated issues slumped by as much as 3/4 point. Despite the relatively larger losses at the long end, the yield curve remained inverted with the yield on the 8.875 per cent 1990 issue at 9.155 per cent and the yield on the Treasury's benchmark long bond rising to 9.041 per cent.

Fed Funds yesterday closed at 8 1/2 per cent. * * * The French futures exchange, the Matif, was closed for over an hour with a bomb scare just after the US trade figures were announced. Happily, French bonds reacted little to US trade data and French inflation figures, which were unchanged on a year-on-year basis. "
134,2006-06-29,2006-06-30,Financial Times,Markets rally after statement from Fed *Nuanced announcement accompanies rate rise.,"The Federal Reserve fuelled a rally in the markets yesterday after it issued an unexpectedly nuanced statement to accompany the 17th successive rise in interest rates to 5.25 per cent. While the Fed hardened its previous language on inflation, and signalled a bias to tighten further in the future, it fell short of suggesting a cast iron commitment to raise rates again at the next policy meeting on August 8. The S&P 500 index, which was already up 0.7 per cent before the Fed issued its statement, jumped nearly 1.5 per cent on the news. Bond prices also rose, while the dollar tumbled more than a cent against the euro as investors reconsidered the interest rate outlook. Futures traders, meanwhile, priced in a reduced probability of an August rate rise - still about 70 per cent, but down from about 90 per cent the day before. Fed officials will probably be happy with that result, as it reduces the risk that they will be boxed in by market expectations as to what their next policy move will be. ""Flexibility seems very important to the Federal Open Market Committee now, suggesting we may be close to the peak in rates,"" said Tony Dolphin, director of economics at Henderson Global Investors. The statement has two main components, a renewed emphasis on inflation and inflation risks, partly offset by a confident assertion that the slowdown in growth, which the Fed desires in order to ease inflation pressure, is taking place. The Fed said ""economic growth is moderating"" - a shift from May, when it said only that growth was ""likely to moderate"". But it toughened up its description of inflation, stating that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months"" and that high levels of capacity utilisation and energy prices ""have the potential to sustain inflation pressures"". As if to underline that the Fed is paying close attention to inflation, the statement mentioned the word six times, compared with four times in its previous statement. The most significant change came towards the end of the statement, where the Fed junked the phrase ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks"". It replaced this with a new sentence that said: ""Although moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures overtime, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain."" The Fed said the ""extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks"" would depend on the way current data revises its forecast for ""both inflation and economic growth"". The mention of growth alongside inflation was taken by investors to signal that the Fed would be careful not to overtighten and kill economic growth in response to short term inflation data. The statement appeared to reflect the preference of Ben Bernanke, the chairman, for more natural language, greater emphasis on the forecasts. "
135,2006-06-29,2006-06-30,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar extends fall after Fed rate call.,"The dollar continued to fall on Friday, adding to the sharp losses of the previous session prompted by expectations that US interest rates will soon be held in check after two years of steady increases. The Federal Reserve lifted the main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent on Thursday, a widely expected move and the 17th consecutive increase. But the central bank was less hawkish on inflation than many in the currencies market had anticipated, sending the dollar, which had stood near a two-month high against the euro, to a three-week low. Inflation remained a concern, the Federal Open Market Committee said, putting more emphasis on moderating growth conditions. ""The dollar will lose its interest-rate support and cyclical growth support here,"" said analysts at BNP Paribas. Standing at $1.2529 ahead of the FOMC statement, the euro spiked 1 per cent against the dollar to $1.2658 within minutes. The euro resumed its rise into Asian trade, and by mid-morning in London was up to $1.2711. The pound got an additional boost from an upward revision to first-quarter UK growth. Year-on-year gross domestic product growth in the quarter was revised modestly up to 2.3 per cent. ""The upward revisions to GDP growth since 2001 will increase the Bank of England's concern about the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy, which was highlighted as one of the main upside risks to inflation in the June Monetary Policy Committee minutes,"" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. He added: ""This increases the odds of an interest rate hike before the end of the year, although the MPC currently seems in no hurry to act and we believe that it will wait until 2007."" Sterling also spiked 1 per cent within minutes of the FOMC announcement and continued its rally against the dollar to $1.8329, up 0.3 per cent on the session. "
136,2006-06-29,2006-06-30,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Markets rally after statement from Fed.,"The Federal Reserve fuelled a rally in global markets after it issued an unexpectedly nuanced statement to accompany a quarter-point rise in interest rates to 5.25 per cent on Thursday. The Fed hardened its language on inflation and signalled a bias to raise rates further, but fell short of suggesting a cast iron intention to raise rates again at the next policy meeting on August 8. The S&P 500 index jumped 1.4 per cent after the announcement to close 2.2 per cent higher as interest rate fears receded. Emerging market stocks soared, with Mexico's IPC index up 4.5 per cent and Brazil's Bovespa up 4.7 per cent. These markets had suffered heavily since May when the prospect of higher US rates rattled investors, some of whom unwound exotic leveraged trades, causing turmoil in local markets. Bond prices also rose, with 10-year yields falling 4 basis points to 5.21 per cent, while the dollar tumbled, losing more than a cent against the euro. Asian bourses leapt on Friday morning led by exporters, on the prospect that a possible end to US rate rises may boost its demand for Asian products. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2 per cent in morning trading, led by carmakers such as Nissan, which soared 5.6 per cent. South Korean shares rose 2.35 per cent to four-week high, while India's BSE jumped 3.4 per cent by early morning. The Fed statement was a jolt to market expectations, but did not obviously represent a major shift in thinking inside the Fed. However, the Fed has been changing the style of its communications under Ben Bernanke, its new chairman, who prefers to focus his remarks on economic forecasts rather than providing hints about the Fed's intentions. ""Traders probably sense from the statement that the Fed is proceeding cautiously, even reluctantly, in terms of future tightening,"" said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ""It seems like it may have caught the market off guard."" Futures traders priced in a reduced probability of an August rate rise - still about 65 per cent cent, but down from about 90 per cent the day before. ""Flexibility seems very important to the Federal Open Market Committee now, suggesting we may be close to the peak,"" said Tony Dolphin, director of economics at Henderson Global Investors. The statement has two main components: a renewed emphasis on inflation, partly offset by an assertion that a slowdown in growth is taking place. The Fed said ""economic growth is moderating"". It toughened its description of inflation, stating that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months"" and that high levels of capacity utilisation and energy prices ""have the potential to sustain inflation pressures"". However, it continued to characterise inflation expectations as ""contained"". Most significantly, the Fed junked the phrase ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks"" - the most recent version of the forward-looking language that it has used to guide the markets since 2003. It replaced this with the sentence ""although moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain"".

138,2007-08-07,2007-08-08,Financial Times,THE SHORT VIEW - MARKET COMMENT.,"It is not Ben Bernanke's job to make money for anyone. The chairman of the Federal Reserve's remit is to limit inflation while safeguarding full employment - not to bail out traders who made a bad bet.  But there is still money to be made on the back of Bernanke's statements. Someone made a packet out of yesterday's bulletin from the federal open market committee.  Look at the S&P 500 investment banks index, highly exposed to Fed policy. After opening lower, it gained 4.4 per cent by midday. Once the Fed had spoken, it dropped 3.8 per cent: and then, from there, it gained 3.1 per cent - huge gains if you picked your moments right, huge losses if you did not. This volatility owed more to positioning by traders than to the message Bernanke was attempting to send.  The salient points of that message were as follows. First, the Fed acknowledged that ""credit conditions have become tighter for some households,"" and that ""the housing correction is ongoing"". This raised the downside risks to growth ""somewhat"". So the Fed at least feels the market's pain.  But it insisted that inflation was the ""predominant"" risk - so the next move in the Fed Funds rate is more likely to be up than down. Some traders took heart from the former, others were disappointed by the latter, and many more took advantage. The end result, after some very lucrative noises, left the markets where they started.  That is where they should be.  Bernanke will only bail out the markets with a rate cut if he is convinced that the credit crunch is so severe as to threaten a recession. Should he decide to do so, his own research as an academic showed that he would have more effect if he took the market by surprise. So even if he thinks a ""rescue"" rate cut may be necessary, he had no incentive to say so now.  Rather, he will look for any sign of economic fallout from the credit crunch. And the markets will be doing the same.  "
139,2007-08-07,2007-08-08,Financial Times,'Uncertainty' reverses early gains on Wall Street.,"Wall Street turned lower at midafternoon after the Federal Reserve maintained a steady policy outlook and recognised recent volatility in financial markets.  Stocks were modestly higher before the Federal Open Market Committee concluded its policy meeting and, as expected, leftits overnight borrowingrate unchanged. Investors focused on the FOMC's policy statement, and the initial reaction was negative.  The FOMC maintained its focus on the risk posed by inflation and continued to forecast a moderate pace of expansion for the economy. In terms of the recent turmoil that has roiled markets, the FOMC said: ""Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing.""  Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards said: ""This was a harsher statement than what the market was looking for. It leaves us with a couple of months of uncertainty and the Fed could have helped ease that with a sentence or two saying 'we stand ready to inject liquidity into the system'.""  At midafternoon, the S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent lower at 1,465.43, off a high of 1,476.60 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,537.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 13,424.47  Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Vix index, pared much of its early losses after the Fed meeting. At midafternoon, the Vix was 0.2 per cent lower at 22.89, up from a low of 21.97. The Vix hit a peak of 26.47 on Monday, its highest reading since April 2003.  TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: ""The statement supports our view that, in the next six to eight weeks, we will know whether the 'wheels are going to come off', either from a financial crisis or a greater than expected economic slowdown due to tightening financial conditions, or (if) the financial markets and economy are going to successfully weather the current storm.""  Among the main S&P industry groups, the financials sector was in the spotlight.After the FOMC meeting, the sector was down 0.3 per cent, and had reversed a 1.3 per cent gain.  Leading the charge among financials however, were Fannie Mae  At midafternoon, the S&P investment bank index was down 0.2 per cent lower and had reversed early strength, with Bear Stearns down 0.5 per cent at Dollars 113.25, while Lehman Brothers was 2.7 per cent stronger at Dollars 59.82.  Cisco Systems was down 0.2 per cent at Dollars 29.44 ahead of results.  "
140,2007-08-07,2007-08-08,Financial Times,THE SHORT VIEW.,"What in the markets can we rely upon? It was hard, ahead of yesterday's announcement from the Federal Reserve's federal open market committee, to discern patterns in the extreme volatility of the past weeks. But one or two trends were clear.  First, markets have lost faith in small-cap stocks. That is a logical response to more expensive credit. Small stocks are more likely to be bought out by private equity - justifying a premium while debt was cheap - and have debt on their balance sheet.  The Russell 2000 index of smaller US stocks has endured a true ""correction"", down more than 10 per cent from its recent high, even after Monday's rally.  Another long-term pattern that seems to be over is the dominance of ""value"" investing (buying stocks that are cheap compared to the underlying value of their assets) against ""growth"" investing (picking stocks with fast-growing earnings). It had grown difficult for bargain-hunters to find true ""value"" after a lengthy bull market, and investors are now attracted by the relative safety of stocks with strong earnings.  What has endured the mess of the past few weeks? First, faith in emerging markets remains almost undimmed. Normally in risk aversion, emerging markets would be expected to fall further than the market as a whole. They have budged but barely any more than the rest of the market. By Monday's close, MSCI's emerging markets index had fallen 7.5 per cent since July 19, when the MSCI world index peaked. The world index itself was down 6.1 per cent. For the year, emerging markets were up 16.5 per cent, against 4.8 per cent for the world index. Compared with other risky assets, faith in emerging markets remains robust.  Faith in human frailty also remains constant. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts have both gained more than 40 per cent in less than a month.  "
141,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,US shares slip after rate rise.,"US shares slipped yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 29.08 at 6,876.17 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had fallen 1.82 at 789.07. Volume on the NYSE came to 485m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumping more than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Economists were divided about whether the move was a one-off tightening or the first in a series of moves to slow the economy. In a statement the FOMC said the ""action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"". The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed 1.2%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.4% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $2 3/8 at $111 7/8, and International Paper, which shed $7/8 at $42. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 at $90 7/8, Philip Morris rose $2 5/8 to $118 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 5.42 stronger at 1,248.06 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.4 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $2 5/8 at $133 1/4. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO ended flat after a morning rally was cut short by the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index fell just 0.49 or 0.01% to 6143.76. Declines outpaced advances 477 to 462 and trade of 87.8m shares worth C$1.60. Ten of the 14 stock groups rose. Metals dropped 1.83%, Falconbridge falling C$1.30 to C$30.45 and Alcan Aluminium sliding C$1.20 to C$48.80. Golds declined 0.92%, with Barrick Gold easing 50 cents to C$35. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ended 35 cents lower at C$33.45 following news that each CIBC dividend capital receipt and secondary warrant would be split on a two for one basis.

142,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Dollar steady on US rate rise.,"The dollar remained steady following the decision to raise US rates by 25 basis points yesterday, and was trading almost unchanged from its London close immediately after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve. Ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee policy making meeting, the dollar remained firm on technical activity. It closed up Y 1.1 against the yen in London at Y 123.9 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM 1.691. Hedge funds sold the yen aggressively against the D-Mark, triggering yen selling against sterling. The D-Mark closed Y 0.56 against yen to Y 73.29 while the pound finished Y 2.7 higher at Y 200.6. The yen was also hit by a decline in Japanese short term interest rates. The Bank of Japan's accommodative stance in its daily money market operations reconfirmed expectations of low interest rates in the foreseeable future as did comments by a leading Japanese banker. Traders are concerned about extra volatility over the next few days due to the Easter holiday weekend and the end of the Japanese fiscal year. The increase in technical activity amid low trading volumes is likely to boost price volatility. ""Our primary concern is a liquidity problem,"" said Mr Michael Wallace, senior currency economist at MMS International, adding that the pound and the dollar which have gained on hopes of higher interest rates could see some profit taking. Nervousness that higher rates in the US could lead to rate increases in Europe affected Swiss short term rates. Short term deposit rates edged up to the 2% level on comments by German officials over a possible US interest rate increase earlier in the week. However, the Swiss central bank has expressed its resolve to counter factors which would hamper an economic recovery, and analysts expect the phenomenon to be temporary. * The Italian lira closed unchanged at L1001 after a volatile day. Comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, that he would have preferred to see the launch of European monetary union put back by a year pressured the lira, although he added that it was impossible for Italy to backtrack at this point. Reports that the IMF's draft forecasts for Italy's budget deficit came to four per cent of GDP in 1997 also added to the pessimism. An Italian financial daily said that the country needed extra budget deficit cutting measures worth L20,000bn this year if it wanted to reach the three per cent deficit to GDP ratio required to join Emu. Strategists said comments by politicians were unnerving investors. ""The clever course for Italy is to say nothing. The problem is that the more the politicians try to calm the markets, the more the markets are perturbed,"" said Mr Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The government is expected to announce its mini-budget with up to L16,000bn in budget cutting measures later this week, and may choose to release it on Friday since its financial markets are scheduled to remain open. * Concerns over Emu and the Swedish government's budget weighed on the krona. A flurry of selling sent the currency lower against the D-Mark although the currency finally closed down SKr0.007 at SKr4.513. The Norwegian krone saw support from investment bank buying yesterday, rising NKr0.034 against the D-Mark to NKr3.946. While some analysts see the krone undervalued, there are worries of an overheating economy and the central bank's continued priority to focus on currency stability over inflation. Last week's first quarter inflation report highlighted the risk of rising price pressures due to a tightening labour market and higher capacity. The krone has appreciated by 5% since the start of the year on the back of its strong economic growth. However, there are some fears of an inflationary boom and a subsequent bust if the central bank does not increase its rates, said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

143,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Stock shortage drives shares sharply higher.,"London's equity market looked to have come to terms with the prospect of a rise in US rates after the FOMC meeting held in Washington yesterday. After six consecutive sessions of losses, the FTSE 100 index yesterday rallied strongly, largely on the back of thebig rally on Wall Street. On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up a confidence-restoring 100 points, and it built on that performance at the outset of trading on Wall Street yesterday when the Dow pushed up a further 26 points in quick time. The FTSE 100 index, which had fallen over 200 points during the previous six sessions recouped 55.9 or 1.3% to end the day at 4,270.7. Demand for the leaders spilled over into the second liners, where the FTSE 250 put on a more sedate performance, finishing a net 15.8 ahead at 4,552.7. But the market's smaller stocks were overlooked with the FTSE SmallCap index showing a 0.4 decline at 2,311.7. There was no news on the Fed during London market hours; a decision on rates was expected shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers said a rise of 25 basis points in US interest rates was fully priced into global markets and that Wall Street would probably consolidate its gains if that was the extent of the policy change. Some warned, however, that a no change policy or a 50 basis points increase would be unwelcome and could trigger another setback on US markets. But the overall feeling in London was that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had done an expert job in softening up markets to expect a rate rise. ""He's warned of irrational exuberance, overheated asset prices and pre-emptive strikes,"" said one trader. Gilts gave a measure of support to the equity market, climbing in a range of 6 to 11 ticks in front of today's auction of #2.5bn-worth of 10-year stock. The big recovery in UK stock prices was evident from the start of trading when marketmakers, who added to the market's weakness on Monday by unloading all their remaining long positions ahead of the FOMC meeting, had to cope with buyers chasing UK shares after the Dow's rise. They hoisted their opening levels, hoping to head off any big buying orders, but encountered a flurry of buyers adopting the view that a correction had run its course in the short term. Demand for good quality stocks continued throughout the morning and carried on into the afternoon when the Dow's early strength gave London a second wind, driving the FTSE up more than 50 points. There were hints, however, that the big marketmakers were becoming increasingly reluctant to make aggressive prices in large sizes because of the extreme volatility in stock markets. Turnover remained at relatively high levels, reaching 975m by 6pm, well ahead of Monday's 805.9m. Customer business on Monday was valued at #3bn. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

144,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Bourses respond to overnight US gains.,"With the FOMC decision on US interest rates expected after European hours, bourses decided that they had discounted a 25 basis point increase and did their best to match the Dow's overnight gain of 100 points or 1.5%. FRANKFURT saw the dollar clear the DM 1.69 mark, the German domestic bond market gain from better than expected consumer price data, and a further rise in US share prices by the American mid-morning. The Dax index responded with a rise of 72.36 or 2.2% to an Ibis-indicated 3,374.93, turnover rising from DM 9.7bn to DM 12.4bn. The response to corporate news was mixed. In steels, Thyssen dived DM 35.50 or 8.7% to DM 375 after Krupp Hoesch called off its reverse takeover bid. This setback, however, followed a gain of more than 50% this year. Krupp, relatively strong against the market but on a less hair-raising trajectory than its target, fell DM 8 or 2.4% to DM 329. On the brighter side, BMW reported higher profits, aimed for higher productivity and profits this year and said that it wanted to raise its return on sales from 3.2% to 7% in the longer term. The carmaker's shares rose DM 61 or 5.1% to DM 1.253. In pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, Merck climbed DM 2.35 or 3.6% to DM 68.35 after the company reported that its 1996 profits surged 36%, and said that the current business year had started well. PARIS pitched in with a gain of 1.7%, the CAC 40 index closing 44.97 higher at 2,624.25 and turnover rising from FFr 4.8bn to FFr 6.7bn. There was another twist in the Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux merger speculation after the newspaper, Le Monde, suggested that Lyonnaise would be the bidder. Suez recovered FFr 3.70 or 1.3% to FFr 281 but Lyonnaise fell FFr 2 to FFr 572. Sanofi rose FFr 19 or 3.6% to FFr 542; it signed an agreement to sell sophisticated blood sample test equipment to Beckman Instruments of the US. Essilor, the lens maker, talked about cutting its debt and rose FFr 30 to FFr 1,530. Higher profits came from CIC, the banking group, which rose FFr 13.50 to FFr 368.50; and from Damart, the mail order thermal underwear group, which was the biggest riser of the day with a gain of FFr 385 or 8.7% to FFr 4,825. ZURICH looked for support to Wall Street and the rising dollar and, by the close, the SMI index stood 61.3 or 1.4% higher at 4,558.6. Novartis, SwFr 46 higher at SF1,760, was the day's winner among the pharmaceuticals on switching out of Roche. The latter's certificates gave up SwFr 80 to SwFr 12,170 as the market digested details of its 1996 profits, which were released after the market closed on Monday. Banks put in a positive performance with UBS up SwFr 19 at SwFr 1,282 and SBC SwFr 7.50 higher at SwFr 301.50. Credit Suisse rose SwFr 6.50 to SwFr 173. Insurers were mixed, with Zurich Insurance up SwFr 9.50 to SwFr 448 and Swiss Re SwFr 29 ahead at SwFr 1,492, both making up for ground lost recently. Winterthur edged SwFr 2 lower to SwFr 987 on profit-taking. Nestle was up SwFr 6 to SwFr 1,577; CS First Boston expected the food group to announce earnings growth today of 9.1% to SwFr 81.20 a share for 1996. Among the smaller issues, Surveillance and Richemont underperformed, losing SwFr 80 and SwFr 15 to SwFr 2,950 and SwFr 1,925 respectively. MILAN moved ahead on renewed strong demand for the telecoms sector, traditionally a target for foreign investors, and the Comit index registered a rise of 5.54 to 735.87. Stet, the telecoms holding company, jumped L270 to L7,475 and Telecom Italia was L155 ahead at L4,265; on Monday, the treasury fixed 3% as the maximum stake that any one investor could take in the company after the Stet-TI merger and privatisation. TI was also supported after Salomon Brothers confirmed its buy recommendation on the stock. Tim, the mobile telephone operator, was also in demand, rising L157 to L4,747. AMSTERDAM recouped Monday's losses, the AEX index closing 12.62 higher at 727.84; financials, similarly, recovered from weakness a day before with Fortis Amev up Fl 2.60 or 3.8% at Fl 71.50 after Monday's Fl 2.70 decline. Heineken rose Fl 12.20 to Fl 334, boosted by Lehman Brothers' decision to put the brewer on its European recommended list; but Polygram fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 92.80 although two films from the entertainment group collected three awards at Monday's Oscar ceremonies in Los Angeles. MADRID brokers said that most buying was technicallybased, and influenced by adjustment of positions at the end of the March quarter as the general index rose 7.34 or 1.6% to 5,438.76. Telefonica rose Pta70 at Pta3,450, helped partly by unconfirmed reports of a tariff adjustment; Repsol rose Pta100 to Pta5,900 in the run up to the privatisation of the government's last 10% stake in the oil company after Easter. COPENHAGEN celebrated a 68% rise in pre-tax profits, well above analysts' expectations, from the cement and engineering group, FLS Industries. FLS closed DKr25 higher at DKr845 as the KFX index rose 0.46 to 153.30. ISTANBUL took a 4.5% dive following last week's 10.3% surge, blaming political tensions between the military and the Islamist government wings of the Turkish establishment and a rise in bond yields from last week's 106.77% to 114.71% following the latest auction. The IMKB National-100 index tumbled 74 to 1,577 but turnover plunged to TL26,150bn from Monday's TL40,730bn.

146,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,US shares slip after rate rise.,"US shares showed modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 3pm, 45 minutes after the announcement was made, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 21.90 at 6,883.35 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had added 1.17 at 789.72. Volume on the NYSE came to 394m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumpingmore than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Shares fell as the text of the Fed's statement was released. That statement - which referred to ""persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"" - was interpreted by some as a sign that there was more monetary tightening to come. The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed more than 1%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.2% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $1 3/4 at $112 1/2, and International Paper, which shed $1 1/2 at $41 3/8. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 1/4 at $91 1/8, Philip Morris rose $3 5/8 to $119 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 3.87 stronger at 1,246.51 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.6 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $3 1/2 at $134 1/8. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO was firm at midday, following through from Monday's rally, but trade was thin and cautious as investors waited for news from the FOMC, and with most already discounting a quarter point increase in interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index rose 21.93 to 6,166.18 in trade of 33.2m shares worth C$586m. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rose 45 cents to C$34.25 following news that each CIBC dividend capital receipt and secondary warrant would be split on a two for one basis. The potential merger involving Avenor, Repap Enterprises and Domtar continued to attract attention. Avenor lost 60 cents to C$23.40 while Repap rose 16 cents to C$2.35 and Domtar was flat at C$11.45.

147,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,MARKET REPORT - FOOTSIE DERIVATIVES SHOOK OFF MONDAY'S GLOOM.,"Footsie derivatives shook off Monday's gloom as dealers in both futures and traded options came to terms with the prospect of a rise in US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers appeared to settle for a US rate rise of 25 basis points following the FOMC meeting held yesterday. ""A rise any higher than that will see us going back down,"" said one. Traders instead turned their attention to the overnight gains on Wall Street. The higher than expected opening trade in the June futures contract on the FTSE 100 was an indication of the trend that lay ahead. It started at a firm 4,264. But for a brief retreat to 4,260 in the first hour, June moved steadily ahead for the rest of the session. There was a brief pause in the contract ahead of the opening of New York, but a firm start to trading in that market triggered a further bout of buying of June in London. It closed at 4,293, up 55 on its previous session and at a 23 point premium to the underlying cash market. Continued demand in after-hours trading saw June break through the 4,300 barrier to settle at 4,301. Volume in the sector was 11,825 contracts. Increased activity in traded options brought higher turnover. Volume was 55,448 lots against 42,765 dealt on Monday. BG was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,173 trades.

148,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Stock shortage drives shares sharply higher.,"London's equity market looked to have come to terms with the prospect of a rise in US rates after the FOMC meeting held in Washington yesterday. After six consecutive sessions of losses, the FTSE 100 index yesterday rallied strongly, largely on the back of thebig rally on Wall Street. On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up a confidence-restoring 100 points, and it built on that performance at the outset of trading on Wall Street yesterday when the Dow pushed up a further 26 points in quick time. The FTSE 100 index, which had fallen over 200 points during the previous six sessions recouped 55.9 or 1.3% to end the day at 4,270.7. Demand for the leaders spilled over into the second liners, where the FTSE 250 put on a more sedate performance, finishing a net 15.8 ahead at 4,552.7. But the market's smaller stocks were overlooked with the FTSE SmallCap index showing a 0.4 decline at 2,311.7. There was no news on the Fed during London market hours; a decision on rates was expected shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers said a rise of 25 basis points in US interest rates was fully priced into global markets and that Wall Street would probably consolidate its gains if that was the extent of the policy change. Some warned, however, that a no change policy or a 50 basis points increase would be unwelcome and could trigger another setback on US markets. But the overall feeling in London was that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had done an expert job in softening up markets to expect a rate rise. ""He's warned of irrational exuberance, overheated asset prices and pre-emptive strikes,"" said one trader. Gilts gave a measure of support to the equity market, climbing in a range of 6 to 11 ticks in front of today's auction of #2.5bn-worth of 10-year stock. The big recovery in UK stock prices was evident from the start of trading when marketmakers, who added to the market's weakness on Monday by unloading all their remaining long positions ahead of the FOMC meeting, had to cope with buyers chasing UK shares after the Dow's rise. They hoisted their opening levels, hoping to head off any big buying orders, but encountered a flurry of buyers adopting the view that a correction had run its course in the short term. Demand for good quality stocks continued throughout the morning and carried on into the afternoon when the Dow's early strength gave London a second wind, driving the FTSE up more than 50 points. There were hints, however, that the big marketmakers were becoming increasingly reluctant to make aggressive prices in large sizes because of the extreme volatility in stock markets. Turnover remained at relatively high levels, reaching 975m by 6pm, well ahead of Monday's 805.9m. Customer business on Monday was valued at #3bn. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

149,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Bourses respond to overnight US gains.,"With the FOMC decision on US interest rates expected after European hours, bourses decided that they had discounted a 25 basis point increase and did their best to match the Dow's overnight gain of 100 points or 1.5%. FRANKFURT saw the dollar clear the DM 1.69 mark, the German domestic bond market gain from better than expected consumer price data, and a further rise in US share prices by the American mid-morning. The Dax index responded with a rise of 72.36 or 2.2% to an Ibis-indicated 3,374.93, turnover rising from DM 9.7bn to DM 12.4bn. The response to corporate news was mixed. In steels, Thyssen dived DM 35.50 or 8.7% to DM 375 after Krupp Hoesch called off its reverse takeover bid. This setback, however, followed a gain of more than 50% this year. Krupp, relatively strong against the market but on a less hair-raising trajectory than its target, fell DM 8 or 2.4% to DM 329. On the brighter side, BMW reported higher profits, aimed for higher productivity and profits this year and said that it wanted to raise its return on sales from 3.2% to 7% in the longer term. The carmaker's shares rose DM 61 or 5.1% to DM 1.253. In pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, Merck climbed DM 2.35 or 3.6% to DM 68.35 after the company reported that its 1996 profits surged 36%, and said that the current business year had started well. PARIS pitched in with a gain of 1.7%, the CAC 40 index closing 44.97 higher at 2,624.25 and turnover rising from FFr 4.8bn to FFr 6.7bn. There was another twist in the Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux merger speculation after the newspaper, Le Monde, suggested that Lyonnaise would be the bidder. Suez recovered FFr 3.70 or 1.3% to FFr 281 but Lyonnaise fell FFr 2 to FFr 572. Sanofi rose FFr 19 or 3.6% to FFr 542; it signed an agreement to sell sophisticated blood sample test equipment to Beckman Instruments of the US. Essilor, the lens maker, talked about cutting its debt and rose FFr 30 to FFr 1,530. Higher profits came from CIC, the banking group, which rose FFr 13.50 to FFr 368.50; and from Damart, the mail order thermal underwear group, which was the biggest riser of the day with a gain of FFr 385 or 8.7% to FFr 4,825. ZURICH looked for support to Wall Street and the rising dollar and, by the close, the SMI index stood 61.3 or 1.4% higher at 4,558.6. Novartis, SwFr 46 higher at SF1,760, was the day's winner among the pharmaceuticals on switching out of Roche. The latter's certificates gave up SwFr 80 to SwFr 12,170 as the market digested details of its 1996 profits, which were released after the market closed on Monday. Banks put in a positive performance with UBS up SwFr 19 at SwFr 1,282 and SBC SwFr 7.50 higher at SwFr 301.50. Credit Suisse rose SwFr 6.50 to SwFr 173. Insurers were mixed, with Zurich Insurance up SwFr 9.50 to SwFr 448 and Swiss Re SwFr 29 ahead at SwFr 1,492, both making up for ground lost recently. Winterthur edged SwFr 2 lower to SwFr 987 on profit-taking. Nestle was up SwFr 6 to SwFr 1,577; CS First Boston expected the food group to announce earnings growth today of 9.1% to SwFr 81.20 a share for 1996. Among the smaller issues, Surveillance and Richemont underperformed, losing SwFr 80 and SwFr 15 to SwFr 2,950 and SwFr 1,925 respectively. MILAN moved ahead on renewed strong demand for the telecoms sector, traditionally a target for foreign investors, and the Comit index registered a rise of 5.54 to 735.87. Stet, the telecoms holding company, jumped L270 to L7,475 and Telecom Italia was L155 ahead at L4,265; on Monday, the treasury fixed 3% as the maximum stake that any one investor could take in the company after the Stet-TI merger and privatisation. TI was also supported after Salomon Brothers confirmed its buy recommendation on the stock. Tim, the mobile telephone operator, was also in demand, rising L157 to L4,747. AMSTERDAM recouped Monday's losses, the AEX index closing 12.62 higher at 727.84; financials, similarly, recovered from weakness a day before with Fortis Amev up Fl 2.60 or 3.8% at Fl 71.50 after Monday's Fl 2.70 decline. Heineken rose Fl 12.20 to Fl 334, boosted by Lehman Brothers' decision to put the brewer on its European recommended list; but Polygram fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 92.80 although two films from the entertainment group collected three awards at Monday's Oscar ceremonies in Los Angeles. MADRID brokers said that most buying was technicallybased, and influenced by adjustment of positions at the end of the March quarter as the general index rose 7.34 or 1.6% to 5,438.76. Telefonica rose Pta70 at Pta3,450, helped partly by unconfirmed reports of a tariff adjustment; Repsol rose Pta100 to Pta5,900 in the run up to the privatisation of the government's last 10% stake in the oil company after Easter. COPENHAGEN celebrated a 68% rise in pre-tax profits, well above analysts' expectations, from the cement and engineering group, FLS Industries. FLS closed DKr25 higher at DKr845 as the KFX index rose 0.46 to 153.30. ISTANBUL took a 4.5% dive following last week's 10.3% surge, blaming political tensions between the military and the Islamist government wings of the Turkish establishment and a rise in bond yields from last week's 106.77% to 114.71% following the latest auction. The IMKB National-100 index tumbled 74 to 1,577 but turnover plunged to TL26,150bn from Monday's TL40,730bn.

150,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,S Africa gold stocks end flat.,"Johannesburg was steady in cautious trade awaiting the US FOMC meeting although, analysts said, a 25 basis point rise in interest rates was already discounted. The bullion price, trading above $351 an ounce, rekindled limited interest in golds in afternoon trade, but the golds index ended flat. Analysts said that some institutional buying was seen at the day's lower levels but turnover was moderate at R613m. The overall index ended up 0.6 at 7,079.5, industrials gained 11.9 to 8,340.3 and golds made 0.3 to 1,326.0. Among blue chips, Anglo added 125 cents to R271.50.

151,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,US shares slip after rate rise.,"US shares showed modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 3pm, 45 minutes after the announcement was made, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 21.90 at 6,883.35 and the more broadly traded Standard & Poor's 500 had added 1.17 at 789.72. Volume on the NYSE came to 394m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumpingmore than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Shares fell as the text of the Fed's statement was released. That statement - which referred to ""persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"" - was interpreted by some as a sign that there was more monetary tightening to come. The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed more than 1%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.2% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $1 3/4 at $112 1/2, and International Paper, which shed $1 1/2 at $41 3/8. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 1/4 at $91 1/8, Philip Morris rose $3 5/8 to $119 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 3.87 stronger at 1,246.51 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.6 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $3 1/2 at $134 1/8.

154,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Dollar steady on US rate rise.,"The dollar remained steady following the decision to raise US rates by 25 basis points yesterday, and was trading almost unchanged from its London close immediately after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve. Ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee policy making meeting, the dollar remained firm on technical activity. It closed up Y 1.1 against the yen in London at Y 123.9 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM 1.691. Hedge funds sold the yen aggressively against the D-Mark, triggering yen selling against sterling. The D-Mark closed Y 0.56 against yen to Y 73.29 while the pound finished Y 2.7 higher at Y 200.6. The yen was also hit by a decline in Japanese short term interest rates. The Bank of Japan's accommodative stance in its daily money market operations reconfirmed expectations of low interest rates in the foreseeable future as did comments by a leading Japanese banker. Traders are concerned about extra volatility over the next few days due to the Easter holiday weekend and the end of the Japanese fiscal year. The increase in technical activity amid low trading volumes is likely to boost price volatility. ""Our primary concern is a liquidity problem,"" said Mr Michael Wallace, senior currency economist at MMS International, adding that the pound and the dollar which have gained on hopes of higher interest rates could see some profit taking. Nervousness that higher rates in the US could lead to rate increases in Europe affected Swiss short term rates. Short term deposit rates edged up to the 2% level on comments by German officials over a possible US interest rate increase earlier in the week. However, the Swiss central bank has expressed its resolve to counter factors which would hamper an economic recovery, and analysts expect the phenomenon to be temporary. * The Italian lira closed unchanged at L1001 after a volatile day. Comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, that he would have preferred to see the launch of European monetary union put back by a year pressured the lira, although he added that it was impossible for Italy to backtrack at this point. Reports that the IMF's draft forecasts for Italy's budget deficit came to four per cent of GDP in 1997 also added to the pessimism. An Italian financial daily said that the country needed extra budget deficit cutting measures worth L20,000bn this year if it wanted to reach the three per cent deficit to GDP ratio required to join Emu. Strategists said comments by politicians were unnerving investors. ""The clever course for Italy is to say nothing. The problem is that the more the politicians try to calm the markets, the more the markets are perturbed,"" said Mr Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The government is expected to announce its mini-budget with up to L16,000bn in budget cutting measures later this week, and may choose to release it on Friday since its financial markets are scheduled to remain open. * Concerns over Emu and the Swedish government's budget weighed on the krona. A flurry of selling sent the currency lower against the D-Mark although the currency finally closed down SKr0.007 at SKr4.513. The Norwegian krone saw support from investment bank buying yesterday, rising NKr0.034 against the D-Mark to NKr3.946. While some analysts see the krone undervalued, there are worries of an overheating economy and the central bank's continued priority to focus on currency stability over inflation. Last week's first quarter inflation report highlighted the risk of rising price pressures due to a tightening labour market and higher capacity. The krone has appreciated by 5% since the start of the year on the back of its strong economic growth. However, there are some fears of an inflationary boom and a subsequent bust if the central bank does not increase its rates, said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

155,1997-02-05,1997-02-06,Financial Times,LIRA SURVIVES REPORT THAT IT WILL MISS EMU START.,"The lira firmed yesterday despite new evidence that Italy might be excluded from the first round of European monetary union. A report in the Financial Times said that European officials were planning to offer Italy a delayed entry in 2000 or 2001, after Emu's planned start in 1999. The lira fell from L984 to L992.5 against the D-Mark when the report broke, but the currency recovered on Bank of Italy buying and the market's gradual perception that a guaranteed if belated entry into Emu could be good news for the lira. The currency closed the day in London L1.7 higher against the D-Mark at L985.1. The peseta and the Portuguese escudo also rose slightly, despite fears that Spain and Portugal might likewise be excluded from the first round of Emu. At one point the Bank of Spain was seen intervening in the market, buying pesetas. The pound soared again, helped by overnight Japanese buying. It broke the key psychologial Y 200 barrier against the yen to close Y 3.6 higher at a 52-month peak of Y 201.3. Japanese purchases of gilts were prompted partly by Mr Robin Cook, the UK Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman, who had previously suggested that a Labour government might well join the second round of Emu. The yen also suffered on the market's increasing belief that the Group of Seven industrialised nations, which meets in Berlin on Saturday, would not try to weaken the dollar. The pound also rose against the dollar and D-Mark. It gained 1.4 cents against the dollar to $1.632 and 3.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.691. Sterling, which plunged last week, has now recovered 6.7 pfennigs against the German currency since Monday. The D-Mark fell despite the news that Emu might start without some of Europe's traditionally weaker currencies, thus pointing to a stronger future single European currency. The D-Mark was hit by weak German industrial orders for December. The dollar rose further against the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 0.7 pfennigs to DM 1.649 and Y 1.1 to Y 123.3. * Yesterday's events have clarified what currency markets expect of Italy and monetary union. Mr Jim O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs in London, said: ""Everybody already knew Italy was not going to be in the first round of Emu."" Therefore, strong evidence that it would indeed be excluded hardly hit the lira. In other words, the bond and currency markets have not been pricing in that Italy will join Emu in 1999. They have merely been betting that Italy will receive a public guarantee saying it will enter in the second wave. So when the Financial Times reported that that is precisely what would happen, the lira rose to slightly higher than it had stood before. Mr O'Neill said: ""If there is really a deal to guarantee that Italy can go in at any stage, it actually makes the Italian interest rate market very attractive."" In short, the only news that would send the lira tumbling is if no such guarantee of membership were given. * Mr O'Neill also said yesterday that Saturday's G7 meeting was unlikely to stall the dollar's rise. ""There's a growing view from a lot of market insiders that there's not going to be any communique from the G7, and that's a green light to sell the yen."" He said the Japanese currency could drop to Y 220 against the pound. Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW in London, pointed out that ten years ago this month, at the Louvre meeting in Paris, the G7 had agreed to try to stabilise the falling dollar. That failed: the US currency continued to slip for several months afterwards. This boded ill for any G7 attempt to stabilise the rising dollar now, he said. * The Bank of England yesterday gave no signal as to whether UK interest rates would rise after the morning's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor. Potentially the Bank could raise rates this morning, but the currency markets expect no move. As forecast, the Federal Open Market Committee left US rates unchanged after its two-day meeting ended yesterday. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

156,1997-02-05,1997-02-06,Financial Times,ITALY RALLIES ON STRONG DOMESTIC BUYING.,"Italian bonds recovered some of the ground lost earlier in the week on reports that European Union monetary officials were drawing up plans to guarantee Italy a place in the second wave of Emu, after 2000. Economists were divided on the reasons behind the BTP rally, with some attributing it to market relief after a period of growing uncertainty on Italy's prospects of being a founding member of Emu. Mr Luca Jellinek, bond strategist at Paribas in London, said: ""Italian bonds made good gains on the back of strong domestic buying. 1999 was never a realistic target date for Italy's entrance to Emu, so the reports on its delayed but guaranteed entry could be taken as a positive development."" Mr David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns in London, said: ""The market's reaction was a little bit surprising. Italy is not off the hook at all. If Germany fails to give Italy less than resounding support at the summit between Mr Romano Prodi [prime minister of Italy] and Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday, then BTPs could take a dive."" Traders said that the resolution of Italy's long-running metal-workers' wages dispute on Tuesday, and the slowing in the annual rate of growth of Italy's consumer price index to 2.6% - the lowest since 1969 - had fuelled expectations of further interest rate cuts by the central bank. The recovery of the lira on the foreign exchange markets, where it had dropped to L990 against the D-Mark in the morning but rose to L985 in the late afternoon, directly tracked the BTP rally. March futures on 10-year BTPs closed 0.83 higher at 130.55 on Liffe, while in the cash market the yield spread of BTPs over German bunds tightened to 155 basis points. Spanish bonos also recovered, in spite of yesterday's report by a government minister that Spain's public debt had risen by 4 percentage points in 1996 to 69.3% of GDP. Spanish 10-year bono futures rose by 0.23 to close at 113.39 in Barcelona. In the cash market, bonos' 10-year yield spread over bunds widened slightly to 109 basis points. Overnight profit-taking by Japanese investors after the appreciation of sterling helped push UK gilts lower after a one-week rally. Traders said Italian investors heavily offloaded gilt futures to realise their recent capital gains and take advantage of cheaper Italian bonds. Liffe's March long gilt future dropped 1/4 to close at 112 1/16. Yield spreads over 10-year bunds widened by six basis points to 174 basis points. German bund futures rose by 0.36 to settle at 102.15 on Liffe yesterday on expectations of a strong rise in January unemployment figures today. US Treasuries were moderately lower in mid-afternoon trading as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Bonds bounced briefly off their session lows just after 2pm, as the Fed announced that its Open Market Committee had not changed interest rates, and them began to settle back near their pre-announcement lows. Near 2.30pm, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 3/8 lower at 96 to yield 6.731% and the two year note was down 1/32 to 99, yielding 5.874%. Few on Wall Street expected the FOMC to change monetary policy, although several economists expect an interest rate increase sometime in the first half of this year. Of more immediate concern to the market was the new supply to be sold next week as part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding operations. The Treasury said it planned to raise about $21.75bn next week through the sale of $17.75bn in three-year notes, $12bn in 10-year notes and $10bn in 30-year bonds.

157,1997-02-05,1997-02-06,Financial Times,LIRA SURVIVES REPORT THAT IT WILL MISS EMU START.,"The lira firmed yesterday despite new evidence that Italy might be excluded from the first round of European monetary union. A report in the Financial Times said that European officials were planning to offer Italy a delayed entry in 2000 or 2001, after Emu's planned start in 1999. The lira fell from L984 to L992.5 against the D-Mark when the report broke, but the currency recovered on Bank of Italy buying and the market's gradual perception that a guaranteed if belated entry into Emu could be good news for the lira. The currency closed the day in London L1.7 higher against the D-Mark at L985.1. The peseta and the Portuguese escudo also rose slightly, despite fears that Spain and Portugal might likewise be excluded from the first round of Emu. At one point the Bank of Spain was seen intervening in the market, buying pesetas. The pound soared again, helped by overnight Japanese buying. It broke the key psychologial Y 200 barrier against the yen to close Y 3.6 higher at a 52-month peak of Y 201.3. Japanese purchases of gilts were prompted partly by Mr Robin Cook, the UK Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman, who had previously suggested that a Labour government might well join the second round of Emu. The yen also suffered on the market's increasing belief that the Group of Seven industrialised nations, which meets in Berlin on Saturday, would not try to weaken the dollar. The pound also rose against the dollar and D-Mark. It gained 1.4 cents against the dollar to $1.632 and 3.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.691. Sterling, which plunged last week, has now recovered 6.7 pfennigs against the German currency since Monday. The D-Mark fell despite the news that Emu might start without some of Europe's traditionally weaker currencies, thus pointing to a stronger future single European currency. The D-Mark was hit by weak German industrial orders for December. The dollar rose further against the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 0.7 pfennigs to DM 1.649 and Y 1.1 to Y 123.3. * Yesterday's events have clarified what currency markets expect of Italy and monetary union. Mr Jim O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs in London, said: ""Everybody already knew Italy was not going to be in the first round of Emu."" Therefore, strong evidence that it would indeed be excluded hardly hit the lira. In other words, the bond and currency markets have not been pricing in that Italy will join Emu in 1999. They have merely been betting that Italy will receive a public guarantee saying it will enter in the second wave. So when the Financial Times reported that that is precisely what would happen, the lira rose to slightly higher than it had stood before. Mr O'Neill said: ""If there is really a deal to guarantee that Italy can go in at any stage, it actually makes the Italian interest rate market very attractive."" In short, the only news that would send the lira tumbling is if no such guarantee of membership were given. * Mr O'Neill also said yesterday that Saturday's G7 meeting was unlikely to stall the dollar's rise. ""There's a growing view from a lot of market insiders that there's not going to be any communique from the G7, and that's a green light to sell the yen."" He said the Japanese currency could drop to Y 220 against the pound. Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW in London, pointed out that ten years ago this month, at the Louvre meeting in Paris, the G7 had agreed to try to stabilise the falling dollar. That failed: the US currency continued to slip for several months afterwards. This boded ill for any G7 attempt to stabilise the rising dollar now, he said. * The Bank of England yesterday gave no signal as to whether UK interest rates would rise after the morning's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor. Potentially the Bank could raise rates this morning, but the currency markets expect no move. As forecast, the Federal Open Market Committee left US rates unchanged after its two-day meeting ended yesterday. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

158,1997-02-05,1997-02-06,Financial Times,ITALY RALLIES ON STRONG DOMESTIC BUYING.,"Italian bonds recovered some of the ground lost earlier in the week on reports that European Union monetary officials were drawing up plans to guarantee Italy a place in the second wave of Emu, after 2000. Economists were divided on the reasons behind the BTP rally, with some attributing it to market relief after a period of growing uncertainty on Italy's prospects of being a founding member of Emu. Mr Luca Jellinek, bond strategist at Paribas in London, said: ""Italian bonds made good gains on the back of strong domestic buying. 1999 was never a realistic target date for Italy's entrance to Emu, so the reports on its delayed but guaranteed entry could be taken as a positive development."" Mr David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns in London, said: ""The market's reaction was a little bit surprising. Italy is not off the hook at all. If Germany fails to give Italy less than resounding support at the summit between Mr Romano Prodi [prime minister of Italy] and Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday, then BTPs could take a dive."" Traders said that the resolution of Italy's long-running metal-workers' wages dispute on Tuesday, and the slowing in the annual rate of growth of Italy's consumer price index to 2.6% - the lowest since 1969 - had fuelled expectations of further interest rate cuts by the central bank. The recovery of the lira on the foreign exchange markets, where it had dropped to L990 against the D-Mark in the morning but rose to L985 in the late afternoon, directly tracked the BTP rally. March futures on 10-year BTPs closed 0.83 higher at 130.55 on Liffe, while in the cash market the yield spread of BTPs over German bunds tightened to 155 basis points. Spanish bonos also recovered, in spite of yesterday's report by a government minister that Spain's public debt had risen by 4 percentage points in 1996 to 69.3% of GDP. Spanish 10-year bono futures rose by 0.23 to close at 113.39 in Barcelona. In the cash market, bonos' 10-year yield spread over bunds widened slightly to 109 basis points. Overnight profit-taking by Japanese investors after the appreciation of sterling helped push UK gilts lower after a one-week rally. Traders said Italian investors heavily offloaded gilt futures to realise their recent capital gains and take advantage of cheaper Italian bonds. Liffe's March long gilt future dropped 1/4 to close at 112 1/16. Yield spreads over 10-year bunds widened by six basis points to 174 basis points. German bund futures rose by 0.36 to settle at 102.15 on Liffe yesterday on expectations of a strong rise in January unemployment figures today.

159,2000-03-21,2000-03-22,Financial Times,Fed raises rates again and hints more to come.,"LITTLE SIGN OF SLOWDOWN AS QUARTER POINT RISE TAKES KEY LENDING FIGURE TO 6%. The Federal Reserve redoubled its efforts to slow the pace of US economic growth yesterday with another quarter point increase in short-term interest rates. The central bank's open market committee raised its key lending rate to 6 per cent, and hinted there was more to come. It was the fifth time in nine months the fed funds target rate had been raised. The Fed's board also raised its largely symbolic discount rate by the same amount to 5.5 per cent. ""Against the background of long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth ... the committee believes the risks are weighted toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future,"" the FOMC said. It remained concerned that increases in demand would ""continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion"". The latest increase sends short-term rates to their highest level since the spring of 1991, when the Fed began aggressively cutting them to stimulate recovery from the last recession. Financial markets had been expecting the increase and were largely unmoved. Since last June, the Fed has raised short-term rates by 1.25 percentage points, but has so far failed to damp the economy's fires. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 6.9 per cent in the last three months of 1999, and early data for the first quarter of this year suggest that, while growth is slowing somewhat, the pace remains well above 4 per cent. This is still in excess of what Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues regard as a safe rate. Most economists expect another half point increase in rates, probably in two instalments beginning with the next FOMC meeting on May 16. What happens next will depend on whether the economy shows clear signs of a slowdown. Interest rate changes tend to work with relatively long time lags of up to a year, and there are now indications that the higher rates may be starting to bite into some sectors of the economy such as the housing market. Higher oil prices are also expected to damp demand. And in spite of a surge in prices of technology stocks over the past year, broader financial market indices are little changed on a year ago. Fed officials have said they are not targeting stock prices - but they believe increased equity market wealth has fed directly into faster rates of consumer spending growth. If there are no clear signs of a broader-based slowdown soon, the Fed may feel it needs to take more aggressive action, perhaps raising rates by more than the incremental, quarter-points it has made so far. Behind the Fed's gradual approach is uncertainty about the performance of the so-called ""new economy"". Most economists agree that technological and other changes have improved the economy's long-run performance, enabling it to grow faster without prompting inflation. But no-one can say what the new rate of sustainable growth is. Lex, Page 32 European technology stocks slide The slide in European technology stocks captured some high-profile victims yesterday, as recent internet debutants fell below their offer prices. Both World Online, the Dutch internet service provider, and Lastminute.com, which specialises in last-minute deals, closed beneath offer prices set last week. More established names also fell, including Tiscali of Italy, down more than 10 per cent to Euros 774.95 ( #474.23), and Terra Networks of Spain, down nearly 9 per cent at Euros 90.95.

160,2000-03-21,2000-03-22,Financial Times,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR - No company is immune to interest rate levels.,"From Dr Richard Hadfield. Sir, I am always intrigued by the notion that some companies are immune to interest rate levels. No companies are so fortunate. It is suggested that the FOMC, the US Federal Reserve's interest rate setting committee, will force the ""old economy"" into recession before technology stocks will be affected (""American business feels the squeeze"", March 21). I would argue that the first companies to feel recession will be those currently relying on private equity funding rather than those already borrowing money. There will be a rate level at which investors will rather receive guaranteed income than vague promises of future earnings and at that point the new equity process will dry up. The old economy's interest expense will have increased monotonically with the interest rate whilst the new economy's interest expense will be more step-function in nature, from zero to actual. At that point, the old economy may be straining but the new economy will suffer worse as it suddenly has to borrow money from lenders wanting interest payments, not stock options.

161,2000-03-21,2000-03-22,Financial Times,Fed urged to curb margin requirements.,"The Federal Reserve should consider raising margin requirements, instead of interest rates, to remedy its concerns about share valuations, urged economists and lawmakers yesterday at a congressional hearing. The testimony before a House of Representatives banking subcommittee pointedly questioned why the Fed's concerns for skyrocketing technology shares could not be better handled by curbing the flow of borrowed money into the market. The testimony echoed a rising Wall Street concern that the Fed's use of interest rates to cool the stock market could do more harm than good in the long run. In the meantime, the Fed's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee raised its key interest rate yesterday for the fifth time in nine months to 6 per cent. The Fed has not changed the margin requirement, currently 50 per cent, since 1974. Stocks bought on margin, or with borrowed money, rose 8.9 per cent in February and 6.5 per cent in January. Overall, margin debt has reached $265bn, and risen by $83bn since last October. Since it appears that the Fed's goal is to temper the stock market to ease consumer spending fostered by the wealth effect, panellists testified a rise in margin requirements might be a more precise instrument. ""Why not use a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer,"" said Charles Schumer, a US senator from New York, who hoped a study by the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission could help crystallise the issue with its release in a month. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has argued there is no direct correlation between margin changes and share prices. Others argue that margin increases hurt smaller investors, who are an increasing user of borrowed money to finance investments. Many market observers have credited the Nasdaq's recent rise to a surge in borrowing to buy stocks. Moreover, it raises concerns that a sudden drop in the market could prompt investors to sell shares to cover margin calls, which could potentially send the market reeling.

162,1993-07-07,1993-07-08,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREUHAND AUCTION GIVES IMPETUS TO BUND INVESTORS.,"A WELL-RECEIVED bond auction in Germany provided an impetus for bund investors yesterday. The DM 4.25bn auction of bonds issued by Treuhand, the state agency responsible for privatising companies in the former east Germany, resulted in an accepted bid price of 99.49 and a yield of 6.7%. There was no official statement of the demand but dealers said it was well-covered with considerable domestic interest. Traders said investors were selling bund futures to buy the Treuhand bonds, which form part of a DM 10bn issue announced on Tuesday. The sale was the main factor in a generally quiet day with no signals coming from the repo rate announcement - the variable rate was left unchanged at 7.3% - and little indication that the Bundesbank intended to cut rates when it next meets on July 15. However, economists hope to glean some information from the next money supply growth figures, due at that central bank meeting. The last M3 figure of 6.7% was above the central bank's target range and if next week's figure is within the range there is a greater chance of a further monetary easing at the final council meeting before the summer break on July 29. Futures selling to buy the Treuhand bond saw the bund contract for September lose earlier gains and close only 2 basis points higher at 95.39. THE UK government bond market ran out of steam yesterday as both sterling and gilts had been considered overbought. With no economic data on the horizon and the tap of 9% stock dated 2008 said to be finally exhausted, the gilts market drifted. Any support that it received was psychological and came from overseas. Gilt futures for September were down on the previous close but 1/8 up on the day. FRENCH government bonds held steady yesterday despite a growing belief that they have hit a short-term high and are ripe for profit-taking. Bond prices were helped by a slightly stronger franc, which recovered from recent weakness against the D-Mark. The yield spread between French and German 10-year government bonds remained very low, closing at 6 basis points, according to JP Morgan. On the Matif, September futures rose 0.18 to 119.78. JAPANESE debt prices were weaker in Tokyo as the Bank of Japan sought to pour cold water on increasingly heated rate cut rumours. Speculation has gathered pace that the central bank will cut its official discount rate, presently at 2 1/4%, by as much as 50 basis points. Although it is considered unlikely that the bank will ease before the general election on July 18, traders have been busily discounting any change. At its money market operations yesterday, the central bank provided far less supply than expected and forced short-term rates higher. The yield on the JGB No 145, which has been below 4.3% in the past few days, rose to 4.35% and when Japanese bond futures began trading in London, the September contract slipped 7 basis points to 109.13. Following comments from a Japanese government official that the pain threshold for Japanese exporters could be Y 95 to Y 105 against the dollar, the September contract recovered to close at 109.30. AFTER posting early gains on cheaper commodities, US Treasuries fell back as commodity prices retraced their steps. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/32 at 105 11/32, yielding 6.679%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/32, to yield 3.992%. After Tuesday's steep rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index had deflated Treasury prices, yesterday morning's retreat in the index prompted some buying among market participants, mostly the professional dealers. Treasuries fell back from their early gains, however, when the CRB index began to recover. Otherwise, attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which was meeting to discuss monetary policy. Although the rise in the CRB index raised some fears that the FOMC would keep its strategy tilted towards tightening monetary policy, most analysts believe it will vote to return the bias to neutral in the wake of weak employment data.

163,2002-08-13,2002-08-14,Financial Times,LEADER - Fed's misplaced caution.,"For now, at least, Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, is content to stick to his guns. The Federal Open Market Committee maintained its 1 3/4 per cent target for the federal funds rate, although it has become considerably more cautious about US economic prospects since it last met in June. Then it described monetary policy as ""accommodative"" and said that on the ""information currently available"", the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth were ""balanced"". Now it admits that the weakness in aggregate demand has been ""prolonged"" and the ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness"". The Fed's stance is somewhat strange. On the information now available, the economy is considerably weaker than was thought at the time of the last FOMC meeting and ominous clouds have appeared on the horizon. In June, the Fed thought economic activity was increasing at a healthy pace but we now know that growth slowed sharply in the second quarter. The economy grew at an annualised rate of just 1.1 per cent. To this, the Fed must add the weakness of equity markets since July, which will severely weaken household balance sheets, and the prospects of a rebound in corporate investment. On their own, these two changes are enough to render the Fed's forecast of 3 1/2 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent economic growth in 2002 all but impossible to achieve. Prospects for 2003 have also dimmed. Consistency would suggest that as the facts have changed, so should interest rates. Instead, the Fed's reluctance to do more than change its assessment of economic prospects suggests it feared really spooking financial markets. It is an unfortunate irony that the Fed recently published and promoted an internal working paper on the lessons from Japan's experience in the 1990s. The paper convincingly concluded that as Japan's economy turned down from 1990 onward and as interest rates and inflation approached zero, both monetary and fiscal policy should have responded with greater vigour than usual. Although US monetary policy responded with much greater speed to the first signs of recession last year than did the Bank of Japan in the early 1990s, it seems that the Fed's willingness to learn those lessons is waning. The risks to US economic prospects are uneven. While a double-dip recession is a distinct possibility and could start a vicious circle of consumer retrenchment, declining confidence and further output cuts, the risks associated with somewhat higher inflation are minimal. The Fed missed a trick yesterday. It should reconsider when the FOMC meets again on September 24. London Edition 1. "
164,2002-08-13,2002-08-14,Financial Times,"STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Equities dip, then rally ahead of US rate news.","It was another difficult session in London's equity market until the final hour of trading, when a strong rally on Wall Street prompted a similar trend in UK stocks and left all the main indices in good heart at the close. The UK's benchmark index, the FTSE 100, ended a session of surprisingly brisk activity a net 50.1 higher at 4,271.7, having been down 59.1 at 4,162.5 an hour before the US market opened for the day. Before the late rally, sentiment in London had taken another knock ahead of the outcome of last night's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee and after some disappointing domestic economic news. Fears that the committee would leave US interest rates on hold, while shifting to an easing bias because of a weakening US economy and a deteriorating earnings outlook, triggered further pockets of profit-taking among many of the FTSE 100's constituents for much of the session. There was little enthusiasm in markets, either, after some as-expected news on US retail sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 80 points early in the US session, before rallying to show a 56-point gain before London traders closed their dealing books. Adding to the market's initial problems was a handful of bearish stories in the utilities sector, normally one of the most defensive areas in underperforming markets. The performances from second and third-tier stocks, even when the leaders were being punished, gave market bulls cause for optimism. The FTSE 250 index was never under that much pressure, in spite of disturbing falls in British Energy and Waste Recycling. The midcap index ended 21.6 firmer at 4,723.1. The FTSE SmallCap, meanwhile, was always in positive territory and finished the day with a 5.9 gain at 2,008.4. The bearish domestic economic news came with the July retail price index data, which came in higher than the market had expected. The core figure was up 2 per cent, year-on-year, compared with a consensus forecast of 1.8 per cent. Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""While the numbers are clearly a little disappointing, they are certainly not a disaster. ""After holding at about 2 per cent next month, RPIX should fall back for the rest of this year and next."" The global economics team at ING Financial Markets said: ""There is little likelihood of a move in UK rates any time soon."" Rather surprisingly, given the potential for shocks from the FOMC after the market closed, turnover in the equities market picked up strongly to reach 2.4bn shares, boosted by programme trading and exceptionally heavy business in Vodafone. The latter accounted for about 16 per cent of overall market volume. London Edition 1. "
165,2002-08-13,2002-08-14,Financial Times (FT.Com),Gerard Baker - A profit warning to America.,"Washington, August 14, 2002 I, George W. Bush, being the chief executive officer of the United States government, do hereby certify that the account I have given of my government's financial performance in the recent reporting period is an accurate and fair picture of our operations. In accordance with new rules that take effect today, I fully understand that this certification carries with it personal legal liability. Accordingly, it has been necessary for me, in the course of reviewing previous accounts of my government's financial performance, to make a number of material restatements of earlier operating estimates, forecasts and accounting policies and guidelines. To wit: o 1 - My senior officials and I stated last year that our budget proposals, notably a $1,700bn (GBP1,080bn) 10-year tax cut, were prudent and would ensure fiscal stability over the medium term. We said the US would, even after the tax cut, still record a surplus of almost $4,000bn over the next 10 years. Furthermore, we insisted that, in line with best accounting practice, we had no plans to spend the surplus in the Social Security Trust fund, the country's pension fund. It now seems, regrettably, that the surpluses we confidently projected a year ago have disappeared faster than documents at an Arthur Andersen shredding party. About four-fifths of the 10-year surplus has gone. And we can only get to any kind of surplus at all if we make fanciful assumptions about spending (how does an increase of 1.5 per cent per year sound?) and taxes (no renewal of tax breaks that will terminate by law in the next few years). Further, there is no way now to pay for the tax cut without raiding the pension fund. If we didn't use the pension money, we would be looking at a 10-year deficit of about $2,000bn, which is about the same size as the tax cut. But after consultation with our auditors (Karl Rove LLP), we have decided we have no obligation to take any action to rectify these problems, which, despite our commitment to personal responsibility and integrity, we blame entirely on others. We suggest any questions about the resolution of these accounting issues be directed to Thomas A. Daschle, US Senate. o 2 - I claimed repeatedly this year that I said during my campaign for chief executive in 2000 that I would accept a fiscal deficit only in the case of war, recession or a national emergency; and, lucky me, I got all three. It now appears that there is no evidence to support the claim that I said any such thing. o 3 - I said, as recently as Tuesday of this week, at the President's Economic Forum in Waco, Texas, that the US economy was on a firm footing. It now appears that more authoritative and independent assessments of our trading conditions (cf Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, statement of the Federal Open Market Committee, the same day) actually suggest the economy is weakening and could be in a hole. o 4 - My chief financial officer, Paul H. O'Neill (who is available to answer all questions on this certification) said on September 17 last year that the stock market would recover its losses and soon be establishing new records. It now appears that, with the Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks currently 38 per cent below its peak, and investors having lost $1,700bn on their wealth, his comments may have been about as helpful to our investors as Jack Grubman's ""Buy"" recommendations for WorldCom stock. o 5 - Last year and earlier this year Mr O'Neill made various statements to the effect that the ""plumbers and carpenters of America"" would not pour their money into suspect Latin American governments so that it could be siphoned straight off into ""Swiss bank accounts"". It now appears that the decisions to support international lending of $8bn to Argentina, $30bn to Brazil, and a direct US loan to Uruguay were a prudent use of taxpayers' money, and a wise investment. We reject any notion that there could be a ""moral hazard"" risk in our advancing such large loans and we stand ready to provide similar support wherever it is needed. o 6 - Richard B. Cheney, the chairman of the board (who has declined to make himself available for this certification), stated in a speech in San Francisco last week: ""We are glad that Congress came together to pass the president's corporate integrity proposals."" On closer examination, we understand that the bill passed by Congress last month was in fact, the bill drawn up by a political opponent, one Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, that I offered no support for this bill whatsoever until it was clear it was going to pass with no opposition, and to say it was ""my bill"" is about as reliable a statement as Kenneth Lay's assurance last autumn that Enron had sound long-term prospects. o 7 - On a number of occasions, I may have misled investors in the United States and overseas about the basis on which my government would conduct international trade policy, in particular when I said last year (passim) that free trade was in ""America's best interests"". Following my imposition of tariffs on world steel and Canadian lumber, I now wish to restate the basis on which US trade policy will be conducted. It is to be conducted on a simple calculation of what is most likely to get me re-elected in electorally tight steel-and wood-producing states in the north east and north west. o 8 - On a number of occasions I may have misled investors in the United States and overseas about my government's approach to subsidies and public spending. I said I would not support large increases in spending, especially to subsidise inefficient operations. Following my decision to support a $150bn package of support for farmers, I now wish to restate the basis on which fiscal policy will be conducted. It will be conducted on a simple calculation of what is most likely to get me re-elected in electorally tight farm states in the mid-west and the south. I believe that these restatements faithfully reflect the condition of my government. Wheretofore I place my seal, this 14th day of August 2002. George W. Bush Signed in his absence on holiday in Crawford, Texas, by Donald H. Rumsfeld, acting chief executive, United States government Harvey, is this what you were looking for? Don gerard.baker@ft.com. "
166,2008-06-25,2008-06-26,Financial Times,Volatile trading after Fed leaves rates at 2%,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Other central banks tighten policies Investors heartened by falling oil price There was volatile trading in US Treasury bonds, equities and the dollar yesterday after the Federal Reserve expressed concern about inflation and kept investors guessing about rate rises later this year. As expected the Fed kept its overnight rate steady at 2 per cent, and brought to an end a series of rate cuts that started last September. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed dissented and sought a rate increase. The Fed's policy statement policy makers read in part: ""Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: ""The Federal Open Market Committee chose to talk about how conditions have changed but not about their leanings. What the committee was unwilling to say for a second straight meeting is which set of risks predominates."" The Fed, also noted that ""labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress."" Given falling house prices and higher energy costs, investors believe the Fed faces a difficult job balancing its twin objectives of sustaining economic growth and containing inflation. William Strazzullo, market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said: ""In the end it comes down to growth for the Fed, rather than inflation. I find it hard to believe the Fed will tighten when the unemployment rate is rising."" Other central bankers were also in the spotlight yesterday as Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, clarified his recent remarks about a rate hike when the ECB meets on July 3. ""I said we could decide to move our rates by a small amount in our next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations,"" Mr Trichet said. Norway's central bank raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent in response to higher inflation and confounded the view of some economists who had expected no change. That came after India tightened policy on Tuesday to counter inflation, running above 11 per cent. US government bond prices weakened in a knee-jerk fashion after traders heard from the Fed and then rebounded sharply. The yield on the two-year note topped out at 3 per cent and then plunged down to 2.81 per cent as traders trimmed the chances of a rate hike in August. The market is pricing in a funds rate just above 2.50 per cent by the end of the year. The yield on the 10-year note was steady around 4.11 per cent after a brief spike to 4.18 per cent in post-Fed trade. Bond yields in the UK fell, led by a 8bp drop in the two-year gilt to 5.21 per cent. UK retail sales were negative in June according to the Confederation of British Industry. European bond yields rose after Mr Trichet's remarks. European and US equity markets rallied as oil prices slumped earlier yesterday. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed up 1.1 per cent, while in London the FTSE 100 rallied 0.6 per cent. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.6 per cent in New York, and pared a 1.6 per cent gain after the Fed news. US corporate credit spreads moved wider. Asian equity markets were mixed, with export companies lower after weak US data on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.1 per cent, while in an abbreviated session, Hong Kong rose 0.8 per cent. Taiwan fell 0.2 per cent and Korea rallied 0.4 per cent. Shanghai rose 3.6 per cent and closed higher for the second day in a row. India's Sensex closed 0.8 per cent higher after rebounding from an early slide of 1.9 per cent. Pakistan's Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index rose a further 2.5 per cent, extending Tuesday's 8.6 per cent gain. In currency trading , action and words from central banks dictated moves. The dollar slipped after the Fed meeting as the euro was boosted by the ECB's tougher talk on rates. Norway's krone gained against both the euro and dollar and India's rupee hit a three-week high versus the dollar. Trading was also volatile in crude oil prices . US oil inventories rose for the first time in six weeks. At one stage, oil fell more than $5 a barrel, before it pared some of its losses to settle at $134.55."
167,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,Dow rallies after Fed pegs rate.,"Wall Street was cheered by yesterday's decision not to raise interest rates, writes Jane Martinson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed not far from its all-time high with a 74.58 increase to 7,303.46. The market had initially reacted with enthusiasm before falling off. Most of the gains were then made in the last hour of trading. Mr David Shulman, chief strategist at Solomon Brothers, echoed other bullish commentators when he said: ""The Fed has given the green light to the stock market."" The decision by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, announced yesterday afternoon, had a more positive impact on stock prices than on the bond market, which was relatively muted. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16 although it had fallen during the afternoon on fears about a rates increase in July. Other analysts believed that the Fed should have raised rates to slow recent fast growth. Mr Byron Wein, US strategist at Morgan Stanley, said: ""The bond market is smarter than the stock market"". He said it was too soon to say what the long-term effect of the decision would be, although he predicted a difficult summer. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting, although the bond market appeared to have factored in no change. The enthusiastic response was widespread. The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index rose 22.64 or 1.7% to 1,363.88, while the broader based S&P 500 gained 8.39 to 841.66. Financial blue chips rallied strongly after the decision, having suffered from some uncertainty in morning trade. J.P. Morgan rose 2.7% to $105 1/4 while Travelers Group gained $1 7/8 or 3.4% to $57 7/8. IBM rose almost 3% or $4 3/4 to $173 1/2, helped by a positive broker's note. Ford, the motor giant, also benefited from rumours of an upbeat analysts presentation and the possibility of a share buy-back. It rose $1 or 2.8% to $37 3/8. Even Informix, the troubled database company which has lost almost half its share price value, rose 4% or $3/8 to $9 5/16 in the upbeat market. It had fallen sharply in recent weeks. However, C-Cube Microsystems lost 22% or $5 5/8 to $19 7/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. TORONTO closed higher after a late afternoon rally sparked by Wall Street. The 300 composite index rose 12.76 or 0.20% to 6,260.14. Declines slightly outpaced advances 482 to 475. Trading volume was 83.2m shares, down from Friday's total of 88.7m. Trading value rose to C$1.52bn from C$1.36bn. The golds sub-index weighed on the market, falling 0.34%.

168,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,Yen rises as Fed makes no move.,"The dollar tumbled further late yesterday after the Federal Reserve left US interest rates unchanged following its Open Market committee meeting. The dollar, which had already fallen sharply in overnight Asian trading, immediately dropped another Y 0.75 on news of the meeting to stand at Y 112.95 against the yen. That was Y 3.25 below its Monday London close. The Fed's announcement sent the dollar falling 1.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 1.6860, 2.1 pfennigs down on Monday's close. The yen had surged even before the FOMC meeting, on fresh signs that Japan might raise interest rates soon. The currency jumped to Y 112 against the dollar after Mr Koko Sato, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, said there was growing political support for a rise in interest rates. Low rate levels were ""negatively affecting pensioners and could also invite further fund outflow from the domestic financial market to high-yielding overseas assets."" A panel of LDP politicians is due to issue a report within days which will indicate that the low rate climate may also be distorting the financial system. The Bank of Japan's official discount rate has stood at a record trough of 0.5% since September 1995. The markets largely ignored an attempt by Mr Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, to play down Mr Sato's remark. Mr Yamasaki said now was not the time to discuss the possibility of a rate rise. Also yesterday, the Japanese trade union confederation said it would soon formally ask the Bank of Japan for a rate rise because low interest rates were hurting pensioners and savers. The dollar came under further pressure after Mr Robert Rubin, US treasury secretary, repeated that Washington's policy towards the currency was unchanged but failed to reel off his usual mantra that the US supported a strong dollar. The yen has now gained almost Y 15 or 12% against the dollar in the last fortnight, on hopes of a Japanese rate rise and attempts by Tokyo officials to talk down the dollar. The same officials are now trying to support the US currency. Yesterday Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the senior finance ministry official known as Mr Yen, said: ""The pace of the yen's strengthening is too rapid."" Japan would ""deal appropriately"" with excessive volatility. That boosted the dollar somewhat. The dollar's slide buoyed the Swiss franc, largely because many traders had funded dollar purchases by borrowing the Swiss currency at low interest rates. The Swissie rose from SwFr 1.428 to SwFr 1.406 against the dollar, and from SwFr 0.837 to SwFr 0.830 against the D-Mark in London. * Mr Ron Leven, currency strategist at J.P. Morgan in New York, believes the dollar may stop sliding sooner than many in the market think. The reason, he says, is that many Japanese investors are hedging rather than selling their overseas assets. For instance, rather than disposing of their US Treasuries and repatriating the income, they are selling dollars forward. That means that if they change their view on the yen, they can return to overseas markets simply by buying dollars forward for the same period. ""If the Japanese had left the US market completely, it would be much more difficult for them to come back in again,"" Mr Leven said. * Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global foreign exchange research at UBS in London, warned that the dollar could fall through support at Y 110 against the yen soon because the market no longer believed the US currency had much upside. The only way Japan could boost the dollar would be by changing policy, he said. Tokyo could hardly cut interest rates, so it would have to encourage Japanese life companies to increase their holdings of overseas assets again, and also to buy Japanese bonds in order to reduce their yields. If the dollar did bounce, many Japanese investors would quickly sell it in order to cut their losses on its recent slide, said Mr Chertkow. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
169,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,US Treasuries rise as Fed sits tight.,"The US Treasury market greeted the Federal Reserve's decision not to change interest rates with enthusiasm yesterday. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16, yielding 6.892%. Uncertainty about the longer-term outlook appeared to put pressure on prices after the immediate euphoria had worn off, however. Prices at the long end had fallen during the afternoon. Some strategist were surprised at the muted reaction in bond prices, which was much less bullish about the decision than the stock market. Volumes were also relatively low. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, said the reaction indicated that the Fed had not been expected to raise rates after a raft of economic data had pointed to slightly weaker growth rates. ""The people who place the bets appeared to expect no change, despite opinion among analysts being divided,"" he said. He predicted a continuation of market sensitivity in the run-up to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee in six weeks time. ""I don't expect it to rally too far,"" he said. ""After this meeting people will start thinking about July."" Mr Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the markets were likely to continue to ""have a bumpy ride"", reacting to each piece of economic data until the next Fed meeting. Yield curves steepened after the news. The two-year note rose 1/8 to 100 5/16 yielding 6.182% and the yield spread between the two-year and 30-year securities widened from about 65 basis points to 71 basis points. European government bond markets trod water yesterday waiting for the outcome of the Fed committee meeting. FRENCH OATs were the only leading European bonds to give any ground, settling at the day's low of 129.64, down 0.24 on Monday's close. Analysts said there was little to explain the drift downwards. ""There's been some profit-taking ahead of the FOMC. Some minor positions have been liquidated,"" said Mr Philip Tyson, European bond analyst at HSBC. ""Other than that, everyone was content to remain on the sidelines."" UK GILTS barely moved, in spite of a big turn-out for the auction of #1.5bn of 7% 2002 stock. Cover was 3.03 times and there was no yield tail. ""We expected a tail of a couple of basis points so we were pleasantly surprised,"" said Mr Edmund Nonis, gilts analyst at Nikko Securities. The auction was small, however, and Mr Nonis warned about reading too much into it. The June long gilt future settled at 113 15/32, up 1/32 on the day. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread of gilts over bunds tightened 3 basis points to 142 points. Preliminary May inflation data from five Italian cities was in line with expectations and elicited few reactions from ITALIAN BTPs. Having jumped to 131.02, the June BTP future settled at 103.89, up 0.12 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of BTPs over bunds tightened 4 basis points to 137 points. May inflation figures from a further six Italian cities are due today. Yesterday's figures suggested that Italian annual inflation would slow to 1.5% in May, down from 1.7% in April, analysts said. Traders in SPANISH BONOS were taken aback by a late rally which coincided with the sudden rise in Italian BTPs. ""I was a bit surprised ... maybe it was just one buyer,"" said Mr Jose Ramon Arechederra of ABN Amro in Madrid. Bonos eventually settled at 116.08, up 0.41 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of bonos over bunds touched a new low of 69 basis points before settling at 70 basis points. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
170,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"An already weak derivatives sector came under further pressure yesterday as concerns about US interest rates combined with a sharp fall in defence-related stocks to prompt a sell-off in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Hopes of a recovery after the June contract on the FTSE 100 opened for business at 4,654, faded when strong selling emerged within the first hour of the session. June, which just managed to touch 4,658, retreated sharply. An attempt to stabilise it around the 4,650 level proved fruitless. June continued to fall, breaking through the 4,620 resistance level over lunch, on its way to the day's low. That was reached after the poor opening on Wall Street when the contract fell to 4,601. Dealers said the decline of defence stocks had come as a surprise to a market already nervous about US interest rates ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting. One trader said: ""The buyers are still around but they are simply waiting their turn."" Some buying interest was seen towards the close as the contract recovered from the day's low. It closed at 4,610, down 47 on its previous close and at a 3 point premium to the underlying cash market. Dealers said the contract had traded at a discount to cash on several occasions during the course of the session. Volume was 12,514 contracts. There was improved activity in traded options and turnover nearly doubled to reach 44,922. Most of the activity was in index options with BT the busiest stock option.

171,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,"Rate worries, company news hit bourses.","Interest rate uncertainty hit the dollar and equities in Europe ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting; some late closing bourses, back from a long weekend, were also digesting the third fall in the Dow in three consecutive days; and the effect was compounded where there was bad corporate news. FRANKFURT, with bad news among blue chips and in the mid-cap sector of the market, put it all together and fell 1.5%, the Dax index closing 53.06 lower at an Ibis-indicated 3,516.20, in turnover down from DM 13.8bn to DM 11.2bn. Cyclicals, primarily carmakers and chemicals, were predisposed to fall on the dollar; but BASF led the big blue chips down on news of a billion-dollar lawsuit against Knoll, its US-based pharmaceuticals unit. It lost DM 2.60 or just under 4% at DM 63.25. Hoechst was right behind, down DM 2.50 at DM 64.85, and Volkswagen closed DM 32.50 lower at DM 1,115.50. However, there was worse in mid-caps where Gerresheimer, the glassmaking subsidiary of Viag, plummeted DM 9.90 or 27.6% to DM 26; the company forecast a fall in operating profits this year due to price pressures in container glass. A month ago, said Mr Stefan Muelheim at Dillon Read, Gerresheimer had attributed a slide in first quarter profits to one-off problems. Now, he said, earnings hopes of DM 2.80 to DM 3 a share, after last year's DM 2.35, would have to be written off, and the shares were a sell. PARIS swept lower with the CAC 40 index retreating 33.17 to 2,751.11 after touching a session low of 2,731.17. Volume was said to be average at 11.9m shares. US rate uncertainty and the soft start on Wall Street did most of the damage, but renewed election jitters, some downside pressure from ex-dividends and disquieting news from LVMH also hit sentiment. The luxury goods giant did its best to smooth over the failure of its newly acquired DFS operation to win two Hong Kong airport concessions, but the shares took little notice, sliding FFr 41 or 2.8% to FFr 1,447. Total paid more attention to the softening oil price than to an upgrade from Goldman Sachs which moved to ""market outperform"". The shares came off FFr 5 to FFr 553, as Elf Aquitaine dipped FFr 9 to FFr 592. Motors were out of favour. Renault fell FFr 3.10 or 2% to FFr 153.9 and Peugeot FFr 10 to FFr 646. Accor, the hotels leader, stood out against the selling pressure, adding FFr 11 at FFr 889. ZURICH was depressed by the dollar and the Dow, and a string of index heavyweights came under pressure as the SMI index dropped 76.5 or 1.5% to 5,081.0. Novartis bearers lost SwFr 46 at SwFr 1,973, Roche certificates SwFr 290 at SwFr 13,205 and Nestle registered SwFr 39 at SwFr 1,818. However, the real pain was in other well-known names: Julius Baer, the banking group, was cut from ""buy"" to ""hold"" by CS First Boston after recent out-performance and fell SwFr 59 to SwFr 1,971; and Schindler, the maker of lifts and escalators, dropped SwFr 127 or 6.6% to SwFr 1,788. Mr Matthew Windridge, head of research at Standard &Poors MarketScope, noted that Schindler was up 68% since its low last July, and 28% since S &P's own buy note on Schindler only three months ago, which took in a target price of SwFr 1,850. AMSTERDAM ended off 6.85 at 787.45 on the AEX index. A handful of stocks made upward progress, notably Nedlloyd ahead of today's results and ING following publication of its US listing prospectus. Nedlloyd rose 70 cents to Fl 48.80 and ING added 40 cents at Fl 80.10. But the broad market came under pressure. Aegon lost Fl 3 to Fl 140.70 and KLM, which puts out results today, fell 80 cents to Fl 58.20. Speculation that Unilever was poised to launch a major US takeover left the shares off Fl 7.50 at Fl 377.90. Among smaller capitalisation stocks, Baan slipped Fl 3.40 to Fl 108.80 in spite of a buy note from HSBC James Capel predicting sales growth this year of 63% for the software group. MILAN threw caution to the wind and opted for a modest upward movement on talk of a cut for interest rates, possibly today should May's preliminary CPI data prove positive. The Mibtel index hardened 8 to 12,435. Ambroveneto, winner in the race to link up with Cariplo, the big savings bank, fell L296 to L4,125 on worries about a capital increase to finance the deal. But there were steady gains elsewhere. BCI, which also bid for Cariplo, improved L29 to L3,585 and Edison gained L123 to L8,155. MADRID was the major exception to the day's downtrend, the general index closing 5.70 higher at 547.56, with turnover up from Pta40.51bn to Pta119.55bn on news that Morgan Stanley had upgraded Spain's weighting from 3% to 4.5% in its European model portfolio. Mr Richard Davidson, Morgan's European equity strategist, said he had been growing increasingly convinced that Spain would be in the first group of countries joining in European monetary union in 1999. Endesa, the broker's choice, rose Pta230 or 2.1% to Pta11,330. VIENNA registered a new all-time closing high, the ATX index coming in 19.05 or 1.5% better at 1,270.36. OMV, the oil and chemicals group, rose Sch98.20 or 6.8% to Sch1,535 on continued investment interest. ISTANBUL put on 1.2% ahead of an acrimonious censure vote in parliament against the Islamist-led coalition government, the IMKB National-100 index closing 18 higher at 1,510. ATHENS had been waiting a long time to set a new all-time high; and although it got there in early trading - with an intra-day peak of 1,695.03, its best since July, 1990 - the mere fact of it was taken as a signal for profit-taking. The general index ended more than 70 points off the top, 48.52 or 2.9% down on the day at 1,621.71, in high turnover of Dr41.5bn. Written and edited by William Cochrane and Jeffrey Brown.

173,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,Dow surges after FOMC pegs rate.,"Wall Street was instantly cheered by the decision not to raise interest rates yesterday, writes Jane Martinson in New York. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 35.44 to 7,264.32 just five minutes after the decision was announced at 2.15pm New York time. However, the initial enthusism was tempered soon after. Analyst said this was partly due to fears of a July increase. The gains echoed those in the bond market, which saw an instant marked turnaround in sentiment after a lacklustre morning. Enthusiasm for equities overturned weak morning trading, during which the Dow had fallen by as much as 65 points. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting. Amid the uncertainty, Mr Warren Epstein, director of trading at Rosenblatt &Co, had played down the impact of the long-awaited decision. After an initial sell-off, he said, any decision to raise rates ""might be seen as a positive"", especially if economic data continued to show strong growth. Early trading in other markets was mixed. Technology stocks staged a fightback, allowing the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index to outperform the blue chips after a period of weaker growth. It rose 6.29 to 1,347.53 while the broader based S &P 500 fell 3.83 to 829.44. Financial blue chips to suffer from the Dow's uncertainty included J.P. Morgan, which fell 1.5% or $1 1/2 to $101, and Travelers Group which lost $1 or 1.8%, to $54 3/4. IBM continued to confound the blue-chip trend and echo other computer groups after a positive broker's note. It rose $2 1/8 or 1.3% to $170 7/8. Intel, also benefiting from upbeat research, helped the Nasdaq increase with a gain of $3 5/8 or 2.4% to $158 3/8. Informix fell $1/32 to $8 29/32 in some of the most active trading on Nasdaq as the market continued to take a negative stance on the troubled database company. A rally sparked by takeover speculation last week had failed to prevent the shares losing half their value in the past month. C-Cube Microsystems lost $5 3/8 to $20 1/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. TORONTO tracked Wall Street from the opening with leading stocks moving lower across a broad front. At noon, the 300 composite index was off 26.08 at 6,221.30. Most industrial sectors eased. Worries about a rise for US interest rates cast a cloud over the banks while golds found little comfort in a stable, but still weak bullion price. Bank of Montreal retreated 35 cents to C$52.80 and Royal Bank of Canada came off 45 cents to C$58.80. Among golds, Barrick shed 15 cents to C$33.40 while Placer Dome gave up 15 cents to C$25.15.

174,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,US Treasuries jump as Fed sits tight.,"The US Treasury market greeted the Federal Reserve's decision not to change interest rates with initial euphoria. However, this was quickly tempered by concern over whether future rate increases would need to be made. The benchmark 30-year bond, having risen to 96 3/4 within five minutes of the decision being made, fell at one point. Some 20 minutes after the announcement, the long bond was trading 1/32 higher at 96 9/32, yielding 6.910%. Fewer sellers hit the short end of the curve as the market celebrated the let-up in immediate tension. Earlier, US bond prices had dropped at mid-session as the market fell victim to nervousness ahead of the interest rate ruling. The 30-year benchmark bond had fallen by 3/16 to 96 1/16, yielding 6.933%. At the shorter end, the two-year note had been down 1/16 to 100 1/8, yielding 6.286%. Volume had been relatively low as traders waited for the Fed to announce its decision. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, had said ""nobody wants to hold the risk on the day it could happen"". The difference in yield between the two-year and 30-year note had already been hovering around its lowest levels for the year so far at about 65 basis points. Mr Logan had said this spread could fall to about 60 basis points with the yield for the benchmark bond rising back above 7%. Traders had suggested selling by hedge funds which have taken advantage of the strong dollar against the Japanese yen to buy shorter notes was also behind some of yesterday's downward pressure.

Financial blue chips rallied strongly after the decision, having suffered from some uncertainty in morning trade. J.P. Morgan rose 2.7% to $105 1/4 while Travelers Group gained $1 7/8 or 3.4% to $57 7/8. IBM rose almost 3% or $4 3/4 to $173 1/2, helped by a positive broker's note. Ford, the motor giant, also benefited from rumours of an upbeat analysts presentation and the possibility of a share buy-back. It rose $1 or 2.8% to $37 3/8. Even Informix, the troubled database company which has lost almost half its share price value, rose 4% or $3/8 to $9 5/16 in the upbeat market. It had fallen sharply in recent weeks. However, C-Cube Microsystems lost 22% or $5 5/8 to $19 7/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings.

176,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,Yen rises as Fed makes no move.,"The dollar tumbled further late yesterday after the Federal Reserve left US interest rates unchanged following its Open Market committee meeting. The dollar, which had already fallen sharply in overnight Asian trading, immediately dropped another Y 0.75 on news of the meeting to stand at Y 112.95 against the yen. That was Y 3.25 below its Monday London close. The Fed's announcement sent the dollar falling 1.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 1.6860, 2.1 pfennigs down on Monday's close. The yen had surged even before the FOMC meeting, on fresh signs that Japan might raise interest rates soon. The currency jumped to Y 112 against the dollar after Mr Koko Sato, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, said there was growing political support for a rise in interest rates. Low rate levels were ""negatively affecting pensioners and could also invite further fund outflow from the domestic financial market to high-yielding overseas assets."" A panel of LDP politicians is due to issue a report within days which will indicate that the low rate climate may also be distorting the financial system. The Bank of Japan's official discount rate has stood at a record trough of 0.5% since September 1995. The markets largely ignored an attempt by Mr Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, to play down Mr Sato's remark. Mr Yamasaki said now was not the time to discuss the possibility of a rate rise. Also yesterday, the Japanese trade union confederation said it would soon formally ask the Bank of Japan for a rate rise because low interest rates were hurting pensioners and savers. The dollar came under further pressure after Mr Robert Rubin, US treasury secretary, repeated that Washington's policy towards the currency was unchanged but failed to reel off his usual mantra that the US supported a strong dollar. The yen has now gained almost Y 15 or 12% against the dollar in the last fortnight, on hopes of a Japanese rate rise and attempts by Tokyo officials to talk down the dollar. The same officials are now trying to support the US currency. Yesterday Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the senior finance ministry official known as Mr Yen, said: ""The pace of the yen's strengthening is too rapid."" Japan would ""deal appropriately"" with excessive volatility. That boosted the dollar somewhat. The dollar's slide buoyed the Swiss franc, largely because many traders had funded dollar purchases by borrowing the Swiss currency at low interest rates. The Swissie rose from SwFr 1.428 to SwFr 1.406 against the dollar, and from SwFr 0.837 to SwFr 0.830 against the D-Mark in London. * Mr Ron Leven, currency strategist at J.P. Morgan in New York, believes the dollar may stop sliding sooner than many in the market think. The reason, he says, is that many Japanese investors are hedging rather than selling their overseas assets. For instance, rather than disposing of their US Treasuries and repatriating the income, they are selling dollars forward. That means that if they change their view on the yen, they can return to overseas markets simply by buying dollars forward for the same period. ""If the Japanese had left the US market completely, it would be much more difficult for them to come back in again,"" Mr Leven said. * Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global foreign exchange research at UBS in London, warned that the dollar could fall through support at Y 110 against the yen soon because the market no longer believed the US currency had much upside. The only way Japan could boost the dollar would be by changing policy, he said. Tokyo could hardly cut interest rates, so it would have to encourage Japanese life companies to increase their holdings of overseas assets again, and also to buy Japanese bonds in order to reduce their yields. If the dollar did bounce, many Japanese investors would quickly sell it in order to cut their losses on its recent slide, said Mr Chertkow. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
177,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,US Treasuries rise as Fed sits tight.,"The US Treasury market greeted the Federal Reserve's decision not to change interest rates with enthusiasm yesterday. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16, yielding 6.892%. Uncertainty about the longer-term outlook appeared to put pressure on prices after the immediate euphoria had worn off, however. Prices at the long end had fallen during the afternoon. Some strategist were surprised at the muted reaction in bond prices, which was much less bullish about the decision than the stock market. Volumes were also relatively low. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, said the reaction indicated that the Fed had not been expected to raise rates after a raft of economic data had pointed to slightly weaker growth rates. ""The people who place the bets appeared to expect no change, despite opinion among analysts being divided,"" he said. He predicted a continuation of market sensitivity in the run-up to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee in six weeks time. ""I don't expect it to rally too far,"" he said. ""After this meeting people will start thinking about July."" Mr Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the markets were likely to continue to ""have a bumpy ride"", reacting to each piece of economic data until the next Fed meeting. Yield curves steepened after the news. The two-year note rose 1/8 to 100 5/16 yielding 6.182% and the yield spread between the two-year and 30-year securities widened from about 65 basis points to 71 basis points. European government bond markets trod water yesterday waiting for the outcome of the Fed committee meeting. FRENCH OATs were the only leading European bonds to give any ground, settling at the day's low of 129.64, down 0.24 on Monday's close. Analysts said there was little to explain the drift downwards. ""There's been some profit-taking ahead of the FOMC. Some minor positions have been liquidated,"" said Mr Philip Tyson, European bond analyst at HSBC. ""Other than that, everyone was content to remain on the sidelines."" UK GILTS barely moved, in spite of a big turn-out for the auction of #1.5bn of 7% 2002 stock. Cover was 3.03 times and there was no yield tail. ""We expected a tail of a couple of basis points so we were pleasantly surprised,"" said Mr Edmund Nonis, gilts analyst at Nikko Securities. The auction was small, however, and Mr Nonis warned about reading too much into it. The June long gilt future settled at 113 15/32, up 1/32 on the day. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread of gilts over bunds tightened 3 basis points to 142 points. Preliminary May inflation data from five Italian cities was in line with expectations and elicited few reactions from ITALIAN BTPs. Having jumped to 131.02, the June BTP future settled at 103.89, up 0.12 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of BTPs over bunds tightened 4 basis points to 137 points. May inflation figures from a further six Italian cities are due today. Yesterday's figures suggested that Italian annual inflation would slow to 1.5% in May, down from 1.7% in April, analysts said. Traders in SPANISH BONOS were taken aback by a late rally which coincided with the sudden rise in Italian BTPs. ""I was a bit surprised ... maybe it was just one buyer,"" said Mr Jose Ramon Arechederra of ABN Amro in Madrid. Bonos eventually settled at 116.08, up 0.41 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of bonos over bunds touched a new low of 69 basis points before settling at 70 basis points. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
178,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"An already weak derivatives sector came under further pressure yesterday as concerns about US interest rates combined with a sharp fall in defence-related stocks to prompt a sell-off in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Hopes of a recovery after the June contract on the FTSE 100 opened for business at 4,654, faded when strong selling emerged within the first hour of the session. June, which just managed to touch 4,658, retreated sharply. An attempt to stabilise it around the 4,650 level proved fruitless. June continued to fall, breaking through the 4,620 resistance level over lunch, on its way to the day's low. That was reached after the poor opening on Wall Street when the contract fell to 4,601. Dealers said the decline of defence stocks had come as a surprise to a market already nervous about US interest rates ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting. One trader said: ""The buyers are still around but they are simply waiting their turn."" Some buying interest was seen towards the close as the contract recovered from the day's low. It closed at 4,610, down 47 on its previous close and at a 3 point premium to the underlying cash market. Dealers said the contract had traded at a discount to cash on several occasions during the course of the session. Volume was 12,514 contracts. There was improved activity in traded options and turnover nearly doubled to reach 44,922. Most of the activity was in index options with BT the busiest stock option.

179,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,"Rate worries, company news hit bourses.","Interest rate uncertainty hit the dollar and equities in Europe ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting; some late closing bourses, back from a long weekend, were also digesting the third fall in the Dow in three consecutive days; and the effect was compounded where there was bad corporate news. FRANKFURT, with bad news among blue chips and in the mid-cap sector of the market, put it all together and fell 1.5%, the Dax index closing 53.06 lower at an Ibis-indicated 3,516.20, in turnover down from DM 13.8bn to DM 11.2bn. Cyclicals, primarily carmakers and chemicals, were predisposed to fall on the dollar; but BASF led the big blue chips down on news of a billion-dollar lawsuit against Knoll, its US-based pharmaceuticals unit. It lost DM 2.60 or just under 4% at DM 63.25. Hoechst was right behind, down DM 2.50 at DM 64.85, and Volkswagen closed DM 32.50 lower at DM 1,115.50. However, there was worse in mid-caps where Gerresheimer, the glassmaking subsidiary of Viag, plummeted DM 9.90 or 27.6% to DM 26; the company forecast a fall in operating profits this year due to price pressures in container glass. A month ago, said Mr Stefan Muelheim at Dillon Read, Gerresheimer had attributed a slide in first quarter profits to one-off problems. Now, he said, earnings hopes of DM 2.80 to DM 3 a share, after last year's DM 2.35, would have to be written off, and the shares were a sell. PARIS swept lower with the CAC 40 index retreating 33.17 to 2,751.11 after touching a session low of 2,731.17. Volume was said to be average at 11.9m shares. US rate uncertainty and the soft start on Wall Street did most of the damage, but renewed election jitters, some downside pressure from ex-dividends and disquieting news from LVMH also hit sentiment. The luxury goods giant did its best to smooth over the failure of its newly acquired DFS operation to win two Hong Kong airport concessions, but the shares took little notice, sliding FFr 41 or 2.8% to FFr 1,447. Total paid more attention to the softening oil price than to an upgrade from Goldman Sachs which moved to ""market outperform"". The shares came off FFr 5 to FFr 553, as Elf Aquitaine dipped FFr 9 to FFr 592. Motors were out of favour. Renault fell FFr 3.10 or 2% to FFr 153.9 and Peugeot FFr 10 to FFr 646. Accor, the hotels leader, stood out against the selling pressure, adding FFr 11 at FFr 889. ZURICH was depressed by the dollar and the Dow, and a string of index heavyweights came under pressure as the SMI index dropped 76.5 or 1.5% to 5,081.0. Novartis bearers lost SwFr 46 at SwFr 1,973, Roche certificates SwFr 290 at SwFr 13,205 and Nestle registered SwFr 39 at SwFr 1,818. However, the real pain was in other well-known names: Julius Baer, the banking group, was cut from ""buy"" to ""hold"" by CS First Boston after recent out-performance and fell SwFr 59 to SwFr 1,971; and Schindler, the maker of lifts and escalators, dropped SwFr 127 or 6.6% to SwFr 1,788. Mr Matthew Windridge, head of research at Standard &Poors MarketScope, noted that Schindler was up 68% since its low last July, and 28% since S &P's own buy note on Schindler only three months ago, which took in a target price of SwFr 1,850. AMSTERDAM ended off 6.85 at 787.45 on the AEX index. A handful of stocks made upward progress, notably Nedlloyd ahead of today's results and ING following publication of its US listing prospectus. Nedlloyd rose 70 cents to Fl 48.80 and ING added 40 cents at Fl 80.10. But the broad market came under pressure. Aegon lost Fl 3 to Fl 140.70 and KLM, which puts out results today, fell 80 cents to Fl 58.20. Speculation that Unilever was poised to launch a major US takeover left the shares off Fl 7.50 at Fl 377.90. Among smaller capitalisation stocks, Baan slipped Fl 3.40 to Fl 108.80 in spite of a buy note from HSBC James Capel predicting sales growth this year of 63% for the software group. MILAN threw caution to the wind and opted for a modest upward movement on talk of a cut for interest rates, possibly today should May's preliminary CPI data prove positive. The Mibtel index hardened 8 to 12,435. Ambroveneto, winner in the race to link up with Cariplo, the big savings bank, fell L296 to L4,125 on worries about a capital increase to finance the deal. But there were steady gains elsewhere. BCI, which also bid for Cariplo, improved L29 to L3,585 and Edison gained L123 to L8,155. MADRID was the major exception to the day's downtrend, the general index closing 5.70 higher at 547.56, with turnover up from Pta40.51bn to Pta119.55bn on news that Morgan Stanley had upgraded Spain's weighting from 3% to 4.5% in its European model portfolio. Mr Richard Davidson, Morgan's European equity strategist, said he had been growing increasingly convinced that Spain would be in the first group of countries joining in European monetary union in 1999. Endesa, the broker's choice, rose Pta230 or 2.1% to Pta11,330. VIENNA registered a new all-time closing high, the ATX index coming in 19.05 or 1.5% better at 1,270.36. OMV, the oil and chemicals group, rose Sch98.20 or 6.8% to Sch1,535 on continued investment interest. ISTANBUL put on 1.2% ahead of an acrimonious censure vote in parliament against the Islamist-led coalition government, the IMKB National-100 index closing 18 higher at 1,510. ATHENS had been waiting a long time to set a new all-time high; and although it got there in early trading - with an intra-day peak of 1,695.03, its best since July, 1990 - the mere fact of it was taken as a signal for profit-taking. The general index ended more than 70 points off the top, 48.52 or 2.9% down on the day at 1,621.71, in high turnover of Dr41.5bn. Written and edited by William Cochrane and Jeffrey Brown.

181,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,Dow surges after FOMC pegs rate.,"Wall Street was instantly cheered by the decision not to raise interest rates yesterday, writes Jane Martinson in New York. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 35.44 to 7,264.32 just five minutes after the decision was announced at 2.15pm New York time. However, the initial enthusism was tempered soon after. Analyst said this was partly due to fears of a July increase. The gains echoed those in the bond market, which saw an instant marked turnaround in sentiment after a lacklustre morning. Enthusiasm for equities overturned weak morning trading, during which the Dow had fallen by as much as 65 points. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting. Amid the uncertainty, Mr Warren Epstein, director of trading at Rosenblatt & Co, had played down the impact of the long-awaited decision. After an initial sell-off, he said, any decision to raise rates ""might be seen as a positive"", especially if economic data continued to show strong growth. Early trading in other markets was mixed. Technology stocks staged a fightback, allowing the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index to outperform the blue chips after a period of weaker growth. It rose 6.29 to 1,347.53 while the broader based S &P 500 fell 3.83 to 829.44. Financial blue chips to suffer from the Dow's uncertainty included J.P. Morgan, which fell 1.5% or $1 1/2 to $101, and Travelers Group which lost $1 or 1.8%, to $54 3/4. IBM continued to confound the blue-chip trend and echo other computer groups after a positive broker's note. It rose $2 1/8 or 1.3% to $170 7/8. Intel, also benefiting from upbeat research, helped the Nasdaq increase with a gain of $3 5/8 or 2.4% to $158 3/8. Informix fell $1/32 to $8 29/32 in some of the most active trading on Nasdaq as the market continued to take a negative stance on the troubled database company. A rally sparked by takeover speculation last week had failed to prevent the shares losing half their value in the past month. C-Cube Microsystems lost $5 3/8 to $20 1/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. TORONTO tracked Wall Street from the opening with leading stocks moving lower across a broad front. At noon, the 300 composite index was off 26.08 at 6,221.30. Most industrial sectors eased. Worries about a rise for US interest rates cast a cloud over the banks while golds found little comfort in a stable, but still weak bullion price. Bank of Montreal retreated 35 cents to C$52.80 and Royal Bank of Canada came off 45 cents to C$58.80. Among golds, Barrick shed 15 cents to C$33.40 while Placer Dome gave up 15 cents to C$25.15.

182,1997-05-20,1997-05-21,Financial Times,US Treasuries jump as Fed sits tight.,"The US Treasury market greeted the Federal Reserve's decision not to change interest rates with initial euphoria. However, this was quickly tempered by concern over whether future rate increases would need to be made. The benchmark 30-year bond, having risen to 96 3/4 within five minutes of the decision being made, fell at one point. Some 20 minutes after the announcement, the long bond was trading 1/32 higher at 96 9/32, yielding 6.910%. Fewer sellers hit the short end of the curve as the market celebrated the let-up in immediate tension. Earlier, US bond prices had dropped at mid-session as the market fell victim to nervousness ahead of the interest rate ruling. The 30-year benchmark bond had fallen by 3/16 to 96 1/16, yielding 6.933%. At the shorter end, the two-year note had been down 1/16 to 100 1/8, yielding 6.286%. Volume had been relatively low as traders waited for the Fed to announce its decision. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, had said ""nobody wants to hold the risk on the day it could happen"". The difference in yield between the two-year and 30-year note had already been hovering around its lowest levels for the year so far at about 65 basis points. Mr Logan had said this spread could fall to about 60 basis points with the yield for the benchmark bond rising back above 7%. Traders had suggested selling by hedge funds which have taken advantage of the strong dollar against the Japanese yen to buy shorter notes was also behind some of yesterday's downward pressure. European government bond markets trod water yesterday waiting for the outcome of the Fed committee meeting. FRENCH OATs were the only leading European bonds to give any ground, settling at the day's low of 129.64, down 0.24 on Monday's close. Analysts said there was little to explain the drift downwards.

183,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FTSE 100 draws little comfort from US rate cut.,"There was a feeling of anti-climax in London equities on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve's open market committee did exactly as the markets have been expecting for some time - cutting its Fed funds rate by another 50 basis points for the second time in a month. And the Fed went a step further, announcing too that the risks in the US economy ""are weighted to conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"", or ""in other words there are more rate cuts to come"", as one dealer put it. Wall Street's response to the news proved a disappointment, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing a mere 6 points higher, while the Nasdaq Composite endured a much worse session, finishing 65 points lower. So it was always going to be extremely difficult for London to make progress against that background. The upshot of the trading session was another poor performance by the FTSE 100, which closed another 45.7 off at 6,251.8, having fallen 64.1 at worst. The FTSE SmallCap eased 7.0 to 3.319.8 and the Techmark 100 36.97 to 2,771.043. The FTSE 250 provided some respite, edging up 6.4 to 6,742.3. And tending to make the possibility of any progress by London stocks even more awkward was the latest raft of domestic economic data, all of which tended to surprise a market expecting evidence of a slowing of the UK economy. In the event, the news turned those expectations upside down. The latest monthly survey of UK house prices by the Nationwide revealed prices rose by 2.5 per cent in January, the biggest monthly gain since October 1994, while the UK purchasing managers' index of manufacturing for came in at 52.0, compared with last month's 51.3. And the Confederation of British Industry's January Survey of Distributive Trades said that retail sales were rising at their fastest rate since May last year. ""The market is telling us that 25 basis points will come off UK interest rates after next week's monetary policy committee meeting,"" said one trader. But Richard Jeffrey, economist at ING Barings Charterhouse Securities, said: ""When looking at the strength of recent UK data, particularly the CBI retail survey, you could be forgiven for asking the question whether rates should be going up rather than down."" Wall Street performed reasonably well, the Dow pushing up 43 points as London closed and the Nasdaq 14 points, in response to more worryingly weak US economic data. That showed the National Association of Purchasing Management's business activity index slipping to 41.2 from 44.3, its lowest level since March 1991. The market view, in the wake of those numbers, was that another reduction in US interest rates, possibly even before the next FOMC meeting, scheduled for March 20. Turnover in equities was 2.2bn shares. "
184,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),Bunds stronger as euro firms.,"Euro-denominated government bonds strengthened on Thursday, responding well to Wednesday's half percentage point interest rate cut by the US Federal Open Market Committee. A stronger euro - supported by the narrowing interest rate differential between the US and the euro-zone - also helped bunds. At 1100 GMT the benchmark 10-year German bund was up 0.17 at 103.62, pushing its yield down 2.2 basis points to 4.776 per cent. At the short end of the curve, the yield on the two-year German Schatz was 4.1 basis points lower at 4.341 per cent. The euro was $0.9430. The December long bund future was 0.16 higher at 109.03. "
185,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unmoved as Fed cuts rates.,"Foreign exchange traders gave a muted reaction to the decision by the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points. But traders said the dollar could suffer over the coming sessions. ""There had been some suggestion that the Fed would boost the equity markets with a 75 basis point cut, now the focus will continue to be on the deteriorating economy,"" said Robert Lynch of BNP Paribas. The dollar had been under pressure for most of the day, depressed by the continued flow of poor economic figures from the US. Gross domestic product data showed the US economy growing at a puny annualised rate of 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter - well below expectations of around 2 per cent. Most worrying perhaps was the sharp slowdown in investment spending by businesses. From a rise of 7.7 per cent in the third quarter, business investment fell by 1.5 per cent in the fourth - the sharpest slowdown since 1991. The Chicago manufacturing purchasing managers index also made fairly grim reading - falling to its lowest level since 1982. ""It is being made painfully apparent that the manufacturing sector is in a deep recession,"" said Russell Jones, head of currency research at Lehman Brothers. When added to Tuesday's poor consumer confidence figures, the GDP release caused some in the market to suggest the prospect of a 75 basis point cut in US interest rates. By middle of London trading, the Fed funds futures - seen as the best gauge of US rate expectations - were pricing in the risk of a 75 basis point fall. The euro ended London trading at $0.93, half a cent higher on the previous day. * But while the economic data continued to affect the interest rate futures markets the damage to the dollar was relatively contained. The euro managed to probe only modestly above $0.93 in early London trading. Analysts said this reflected the reluctance of investors to write off the US economy just yet. ""There are certainly few who want to take big bets ahead of the FOMC decision and there is always the risk that the non-farm payroll figures on Friday will disappoint,"" said Tony Norfield, head of currency research at ABN Amro in London. In addition traders said that the euro continued to labour under the weight of long positions. Many traders were quick to buy into the currency as it surged at the end of last year and are now reluctant to add to these positions. The latest IMM data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange showed that these positions had been pared back. ""These should soon be cleared, allowing the euro to move higher,"" said Mr Norfield. ""But for the moment they continue to hold the euro back."" * With the Fed decision out of the way, one question uppermost on European traders' minds is likely to be whether the European Central Bank will follow suit. The bank holds its fortnightly monetary policy meeting today, but recent comments by ECB board members have suggested a reluctance to ease monetary policy. ""Our central view is that the refinancing rate will remain on hold at 4.75 per cent throughout 2001,"" said David Page at Investec in London. But he adds that this view hinges on ""a visible recovery"" in the US by the second half of 2001. ""Without this the slowdown in the global economy will be sharper this year, with the repercussions felt more strongly in the euro area, thus prompting the ECB to cut rates."" Yesterday's slew of euro-zone producer price inflation data all pointed to moderating price pressures. Italian producer price growth registered its first month-on-month decline in two years, with the annual rate slipping to 6.2 per cent from 6.7 per cent. Producer price inflation in France fell to 4.7 per cent from 5.9 per cent. "

The composite index closed with a gain of 26.57 at 617.91. Posco picked up 11.4 per cent to Won97,000 as bargain hunters moved in on the view that Tuesday's 12 per cent fall was overdone. Brokerages jumped 9.2 per cent as expectations grew for a sharp cut in US interest rates last night. Bankrupt Hanbo Steel was up its daily 15 per cent limit to Won2,700 aftger the state run Asset Management Corp said it would sell the company in parts to accelerate its disposal. Tokyo ended marginally higher in cautious trading as investors awaited US interest rate developments, writes Bayan Rahman. The benchmark Nikkei 225 average finished virtually all square, up 0.1 per cent at 13,843.55 after trading narrowly between 13,726.51 and 13,855.74.

""The market has been moving in a very tight range the past few days while people are waiting for the result of the FOMC meeting,"" said Koji Fujiwara at BNP Paribas. Mr Fujiwara said the market was supported by hopes that a government panel would this week recommend measures to underpin the stock market. But on the down side was the continued unwinding of cross-held shares. The securities sector extended Tuesday's decline, falling 2.6 per cent. Sector leader Nomura, which reports its earnings on Monday, fell Y85 or 3.8 per cent to Y2,160. Daiwa dropped Y7 to Y1,189 and Nikko dropped Y15 to Y848.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 per cent. Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. Manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment. Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates should support growth of the economy over time. Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the future. The Federal Reserve board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco."" http://federalreserve.gov/fomc.

188,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Greenspan shifts bias to neutral - FEDERAL RESERVE INTEREST RATE RISE.,"For the second straight meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee, it was not what the central bankers chose to do immediately with interest rates but what they hinted they might do in the future that had most impact on financial markets. Yesterday's quarter point increase in the committee's target for the Fed funds rate had been so widely flagged in advance of the meeting that only a financial hermit can have been surprised by it. However, the Fed's decision to change, and to announce the change, in its inelegantly named ""inter-meeting policy directive"" - the bias that indicates which way policy-makers are leaning for future policy - was a welcome shock, at least for stock and bond holders. Having adopted a ""tightening bias"" at the May meeting - the first clear signal that a rate rise was coming - the committee members, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, yesterday shifted the bias back to neutral. This reflected, in their words, that the balance of risks to the economy was now even. Money markets have been discounting for the last few weeks not just yesterday's rate rise but at least one, and possibly two more later this year. The expectation was that, aware that markets were anticipating those further tightenings, the Fed would maintain its policy bias in favour of raising rates. However, yesterday's gear-shift casts more than just a little doubt now on whether, in fact, Mr Greenspan and the Fed will go much further in the coming months. ""It's one and he's done!"" as Richard Yamarone, senior economist at Argus Research, a consultancy in New York, put it. Some keen observers of the Fed cautioned against over-confidence, in the veiled world of central bank semiotics, that this was indeed the Fed's intentions. When the Fed raised interest rates in 1994-5, and again in 1997, on each occasion when it went into the relevant meeting with a tightening bias, it shifted the bias back to neutral after the rate rise Yet that did not stop the committee from voting to raise rates again at the subsequent meeting. The explanation for that approach, according to Fed insiders, was that, a reversion to neutrality was self-prescribing. Since they can, in principle, choose to raise interest rates by as much as they like, the committee members must, by definition, feel they had put policy on an even keel when they changed rates. To raise rates and maintain a tightening bias might indicate the Fed was not convinced it had raised rates by enough - an odd position to be in. However, the difference with yesterday's change is that it was announced immediately. Last December, in a genuflection towards greater glasnost at the Fed, the FOMC members decided that they would, in future, sometimes announce a bias change immediately, rather than wait for the publication of the meeting's minutes, six weeks or more hence. And it is this ""sometimes"" that is so important in understanding yesterday's announcement. According to the minutes of that meeting last year, the FOMC decided it would announce changes ""on those occasions when it wanted to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy"". Such announcements would not be made after every change in the symmetry of the directive but only when it seemed important for the public to be aware of an important shift in the members' views."" It could hardly be clearer. Yesterday's decision to publicise the change in bias must have been made with that paragraph at the forefront of members' minds. If the change in directive had merely been a piece of semantic, internal housecleaning, it could hardly have been deemed important enough to be announced. Of course, notwithstanding all this Kremlinology, the shift in the bias does not guarantee the Fed will not raise rates at its next meeting. If the economic data in the next seven weeks shows any renewed signs of inflation, the Fed will almost certainly tighten policy, whatever its predisposition. However, yesterday's surprise move, greeted euphorically by financial markets, and with good reason, almost certainly indicates the Fed is much less predisposed to raise rates than almost anyone had suspected.

189,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,Fed raises interest rates to 5%.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday raised US short-term interest rates for the first time in more than two years in an effort to take some heat out of the pace of economic growth - but hinted it was in no hurry to put rates up again soon. The central bank's policy-making open market committee lifted the target for its key short-term lending instrument - the fed funds rate - by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 per cent, the first increase since March 1997. The increase had been widely signalled by Fed officials, most notably Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and was no surprise to financial markets. But policymakers sweetened the pill with an announcement that they were shifting their policy bias - their view on the likely next move in rates - back to neutral from a bias towards tightening which was adopted at the May committee meeting. Stock and bond prices rose sharply on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 155.45 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 10,970, reversing a loss of 50 points before the Fed announcement. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond jumped more than a point, and the yield slid to 5.97 per cent, against Tuesday's closing yield of 6.07 per cent. In a statement, the central bank indicated the rate increase had been driven mainly by a return to normality in domestic and international financial markets after the global crisis of the last year, which prompted the central bank to cut rates by 0.75 percentage points in two months. But the decision to accompany yesterday's rate increase with a reversion to a neutral bias hinted that the Fed saw no pressing reason to go further than the one increase and raise rates again in the immediate future. ""Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action,"" the statement said. It added that the Fed ""in the current dynamic environment must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth."" ""The Fed is saying it still has a very slight bias towards raising rates. But basically, this was a big surprise and a buy signal for the markets,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at J.P. Morgan, the investment bank, in New York. The US economy has grown at an annual rate of 4 per cent or more for the last three years. Some Fed officials, including Mr Greenspan, believe the rapid growth has been in part the result of a radical improvement in the long-term potential of the US economy, but they do not believe such a rate of growth can be sustained without a resurgence of inflation. Most analysts had expected the Fed to signal its readiness to raise rates again. Yesterday's decision to drop that stance does not mean the central bank will not raise rates again, but suggests policymakers may be confident the economy will slow of its own accord.

190,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,LEADER - US interest rates.,"The US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point comes as no surprise. It will do little to slow domestic demand. Yet it marks a shift in Fed policy, and a significant change in the international economy. At the height of the international crisis last autumn, as US financial markets seized up, the Fed cut interest rates in three steps by a total of 0.75 percentage points. The Fed's injection of liquidity, together with the strength of US consumer demand, helped the financial storm to blow itself out. Since then the US has continued to grow at above a 4 per cent annual rate, and the euro-zone now shows encouraging signs. Moreover, there has even been some - perhaps temporary - good news from Japan. And developing Asia is recovering too. With the world on the mend, the Fed is now turning its attention back to domestic matters. It is doing so carefully. Having prepared the ground by signalling a bias towards tightening in May, the Federal Open Market Committee has followed up with a cautious quarter point increase. Inflation remains subdued. But Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has made it clear that pre-emptive action is needed to stop growing imbalances in the economy from sparking off inflation. The OECD forecasts US growth of 3.6 per cent this year. But domestic demand has been growing at a 7 per cent rate, much faster than domestic supply. Weakness in the international economy - and the US's growing current account deficit - have so far kept domestic inflation under control. But a weaker dollar, as the world recovers, would renew inflationary pressures. Moreover, with unemployment at 4.2 per cent, a thirty year low, the drying up of the labour pool risks re-igniting inflation. One quarter-point increase will do little to slow domestic demand growth. For now, the Fed is relying on the bond market to do that. Long term interest rates - which dipped below 5 per cent last autumn - are back above 6 per cent, tightening credit conditions throughout the economy. The Fed has judged that shifting back a little from its emergency footing is enough for now. It reinforced this point by announcing a ""neutral bias"" in monetary policy in the near future. If this approach was influenced by concerns over upsetting an equity market where valuations look stretched, this was a mistake. It is not the central bank's role to target asset prices. Rather, its job is to head off inflation and sustain the US economy's remarkable expansion. The Fed has left itself more work to do. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

191,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Fed funds rate rise leaves dollar cold.,"The US dollar initially weakened on the foreign currency markets after the Federal Reserve nudged interest rates 25 basis points higher yesterday, but tempered the increase by returning to a neutral bias. The Fed said while US labour markets were tight, productivity gains had contained inflation. Despite the return to a neutral bias, the committee said it would remain alert to inflationary pressures. A rally in US bonds and stocks immediately after the decision failed to translate into dollar strength and the US currency was weaker against the euro and the yen in New York trading. The Fed's decision divided analysts over its longer-term impact. ""By encouraging a rally in bond markets and avoiding alarm in the equity markets, this move should be good for the dollar,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Tokyo-Mitsubishi. But Robert Lynch, currency analyst at Paribas in New York, said most of the good news was now priced into the dollar. The Fed's decision overshadowed signs of recovery in one of Europe's most sickly economies, with Italian gross domestic product data beating expectations. But the euro failed to take heart, closing the London session down at $1.031 against the dollar. Analysts said the accumulation of positive economic data could prevent the euro declining to parity with the dollar. ""From German GDP to the latest Insee survey, there are signs that things are turning around,"" said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street. * The yen once again strayed perilously close to the intervention danger zone yesterday, lifted by rising Japanese bond yields. Reports in the Japanese press that new bond issuance would be necessary to fund support for bank depositors provided an initial boost for JGB yields. Comments from Masaru Hayami, Bank of Japan governor, that the zero interest rate policy could not last forever, gave added momentum to the move, taking yields to their highest level in three months. The yen rose in sympathy, pushing the dollar back below Y121 and the euro under Y125. Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said rises in JGB yields could further push the yen upwards. He added the market may also have been emboldened by a belief that the BoJ would not intervene until after the FOMC meet, but said official resolve to prevent a rising yen damaging Japanese stocks should keep the dollar above Y120. * Although yesterday's widely expected Fed decision took US interest rates above those in Canada and Australia, only sterling has so far been singled out for punishment. Though still uncomfortably strong against the euro, the pound has recently slipped below its two-year trading range against the dollar in expectation that rates would cross over. Meanwhile the Australian and Canadian dollars, whose official rates were at 4.75 per cent at the time of the Fed decision, have remained relatively resilient. Analysts said this disparity was partly due to the near-unanimous decision by the Bank of England's monetary policy committee in favour of the latest rate cut. With UK inflation undershooting its target last month and sterling strong, most believe it will be some time before the MPC follows the Fed. By contrast, said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Barings, Canada is more likely to be carried along by further US rises. ""Though not expected to follow through immediately on rates, the latest GDP figures show the economy in robust form,"" he said. Analysts said stronger commodity prices had also enabled the Australian and Canadian dollars to withstand interest rate pressure. But others were more mystified that sterling alone had suffered. ""Interest rate futures markets have been pricing in a cross over in UK and US interest rates since the start of the year,"" said Michael Metcalfe, currency analyst at NatWest GFM. ""Given that UK rates have clearly troughed and the economy continues to gather momentum, the move in sterling is hard to justify."" * In late afternoon in New York, the dollar was trading at Y121.21 to the yen and at $1.0346 to the euro.

192,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Footsie closes off best ahead of interest rate news.,"A promising start to yester-day's London trading soon gave way to another dose of uncertainty as investors preferred to sit out the final session of the second quarter. At the finish of a rather tense, but generally thinly traded session, the FTSE 100 index closed 11.4 ahead at 6,318.5. During the previous two sessions the index gave up 128.3 or 2 per cent as London became increasingly uneasy over the prospect of a rise in US rates. There were no such fireworks in the FTSE 250, 6.8 firmer at 5,858.2, or the FTSE SmallCap, 0.6 off at 2,650.6. Dealers said it was no surprise that the institutions refused to trade ahead of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's open market committee on whether to raise interest rates. Before the announcement last night, observers said a 25 basis points increase in US rates had already been priced into Wall Street. There was no further support for London as Wall Street opened yesterday, however, with the recent upsurge by the Dow Jones Industrial Average halted by growing unease ahead of the FOMC result. Overnight, the US market had delivered another stunning performance, the Dow registering its second consecutive three-figure gain, following up Monday's 103-point rise with a 160-point upsurge, for a two-day gain of 263 or 2.5 per cent. And that performance saw the FTSE 100 make rapid early progress and record a 64.5 gain before running out of steam and slipping all the way back into negative ter-ritory just before midday. There was more switching activity being carried out by the big tracker funds to accommodate Vodafone AirTouch's increased weighting in the FTSE 100, which involved the institutions adjusting weightings across the rest of the index via a series of programme trades. Turnover in Vodafone AirTouch was 51m shares - around 4.5 per cent of the overall market total which reached a hefty 1.16bn. It was also inflated by renewed heavy trading in Asda, where Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, acting for Wal-Mart, continued to mop up Asda shares. Turnover in Asda was 75m shares, or 6.5 per cent of the total. The resumption of the tennis at Wimbledon, after Tuesday's washout, and the involvement of the two leading UK players, provided a substantial diversion. The big winner in the FTSE 100 was Bass, whose shares were top of the FTSE 100 table on the view that the Bass/Punch Taverns offer for Allied Domecq's pubs business might still emerge victorious despite Whitbread's statement that it is planning to up its bid. Mining stocks in the FTSE 100, Anglo American, Billiton and Rio Tinto, also progressed after the surprise news that Phelps Dodge, the big mining group, is cutting its US copper output, hard on the heels of a similar move by BHP last week. There was plenty of bid action in the minnows to keep the speculators happy; bid news was behind the spectacular gains in Euclidian, the Lloyds insurance group, which attracted a management buy-out and Hicking Pentecost, where Coats Viyella trumped the existing US offer.

Stocks had traded cautiously early in the session, on the second day of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting. With expectations of a Fed tightening already priced into the psychology of many US investors, the 25 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate to 5 per cent came as no surprise. However, a concern remains that the Fed will need to take more drastic action in the near future. Declining shares only slightly outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a margin of 14 to 13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave some ground early in the session after Tuesday's broad rally that sent the blue-chip index 160 points higher. But shortly after news of the rate rise came,the Dow was trading 101.63 higher at 10,916.98 and the broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was 9.15 ahead at 1,360.60. Earlier, high-tech shares had traded lower, with the Nasdaq composite down 5.46 to 2,636.65. There was more life in the small company sector where the Russell 2000 index was up 1.17 to 455.25.

196,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times,Fed eases rates but warns on future cuts.,"The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent yesterday, but warned investors against banking on further monetary easing, sending short-term government bond yields soaring.  The central bank signalled that it was shifting to a neutral stance on future rate cuts, saying ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"".  This means that Fed policymakers see the likelihood of further rate cuts as being no greater than the likelihood of increases in contrast to the market, which before the decision was pricing in substantial further easing in the months ahead.  One Fed governor, Thomas Hoenig of Kansas City, Missouri, dissented. He preferred to leave rates unchanged in another signal that the Fed may be more hawkish than the markets might have hoped.  ""This should not be read as the Fed closing the door on easing, but they are signalling that the bar will be set quite high for them to cut at the next meeting,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  The yield on the two-year note, which is particularly sensitive to short-term changes in monetary policy, rose 13 basis points to a high of 3.93 per cent. Interest rate futures reflected sharply lower odds of further rate cuts when the FOMC meets in December and January.  The dollar also fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro, while stocks staged a strong rally late in the day, amid optimism that the Fed had done enough to insulate the broader economy from problems in the housing and credit markets.  The central bank predicted in its statement accompanying the rate decision that ""the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near-term"" as the housing slump intensifies.  But it added that the second successive rate cut ""should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time"".  The statement from the Fed played down expectations of future rate cuts.  Disappointing earnings in the banking sector and downbeat corporate forecasts have added to concerns about a slowdown.  However, US gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the three months to the end of September.  ""This one was for the banks. The cut is intended to keep money flowing freely and stem the risk of spillover from the financial markets to the real economy,"" said Jeoff Hall, an economist at Thomson Financial.

But news of 4,000 more job cuts lifted the stock 3.2 per cent to Dollars 9.69.  Weyerhaeuser  was also higher in spite of a 55 per cent fall in net income as the US housing slump hit demand for its timber products. The shares were up 2.2 per cent to Dollars 75.91.

198,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times,Fed eases rates but warns over future cuts.,"The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 4.5 per cent yesterday, but warned investors against banking on further monetary easing, sending short-term government bond yields soaring.  The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee signalled it was shifting to a neutral stance on future rate cuts, saying ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"". This means Fed policymakers see the likelihood of more cuts as being no greater than the likelihood of rate hikes, in contrast to the market, which had been pricing in big further easing in the months ahead.  One Fed governor, Thomas Hoenig of Kansas City, Missouri, dissented. He preferred to leave rates unchanged in another signal that the Fed may be more hawkish than the markets might have hoped. ""This should not be read as the Fed closing the door on easing, but they are signalling that the bar will be set quite high for them to cut at the next meeting,"" said strategist Alan Ruskin at RBS Greenwich Capital.  The yield on the two-year note, which is particularly sensitive to short-term monetary policy changes, rose 13 basis points to a high of 3.93 per cent. Interest rate futures reflected lower odds of further rate cuts when the FOMC meets in December and January.  The Fed is ""telling you they're on hold probably through December'', said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading at HSBC. But investors continued to price in a high probability of a cut in rates to 4.25 per cent at the January meeting.  The dollar also fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro, while stocks staged a strong rally late in the day amid optimism that the Fed had done enough to insulate the broader economy from problems in the housing and credit markets.  The Fed predicted in its statement accompanying the rate decision that ""the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term"" as the housing slump intensifies. But it added that the second successive rate cut ""should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time"".  The Fed played down expectations of future rate cuts, noting that while readings on ""core inflation have improved modestly . . . recent increases in energy and commodity prices"" may put ""renewed upward pressure on inflation"". This may reflect internal pressure from regional Fed presidents who fear an overreaction to the credit squeeze could let inflation out of the bag.  Disappointing earnings in the banking sector and downbeat corporate forecasts have added to concerns about a slowdown in activity, in spite of a strong overall performance last quarter.

200,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times,Dollar plummets on rate cut as bond yields rise.,"The dollar sank to new lows yesterday and bond yields rose after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent while appearing to signal that it was in no rush to cut rates again in the near future.  Equity investors were initially disappointed by the statement, but buyers soon emerged and stocks closed sharply higher.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 13,930.01 after being up 0.4 per cent before the Fed's move. The S&P 500 rallied 1.2 per cent to 1,549.38, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 2,859.12.  ""It appears that the equity market believes the Fed is on top of things,"" said Al Greenberg, head floor trader at the CBOE for BNY ConvergEx. ""Once investors digested what the Fed had to say, they started to run the market higher.""  The Federal Open Market Committee said: ""The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."" The FOMC also said this cut, along with September's 50-basis-point cut, ""should forestall the hit to economy caused by recent financial turmoil"".  Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers said: ""More generally, when the FOMC discusses rate moves in cumulative terms, they are coming to or at the end of whatever cycle they had been in.""  The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 13bp to 3.94 per cent and interest rate futures reduced expectations of further cuts when the FOMC meets in December and early next year. The yield on the 10-year note rose 8bp to 4.465 per cent.  ""The prospect of further rate cuts is not looking good,"" said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies &Co. ""The economy and the markets have improved in the last six weeks and until housing weakness rolls over into the broad economy, the Fed will not aggressively ease.""  The latest Fed cut came after US gross domestic product in the third quarter rose by an annualised 3.9 per cent, beating market expectations. Yesterday's numbers also showed household spending and business investment remained robust.  On currency markets , the dollar fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro after the rate cut was announced. The dollar index, a measure of the US unit's strength against a basket of other major currencies, also hit a new low.  ""This outcome will keep the dollar's longer term downtrend intact,"" said Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman. Sterling rose to a 26-year peak against the dollar after a stronger-than-expected rise in UK house prices in October contrasted with recent data showing slowing mortgage demand and weaker buyer confidence. UK Gilt prices fell on the data, driving the yield on the 10-year note 3.9bp higher to 4.97 per cent.  The Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold at 0.5 per cent, offering no support for the weak yen. Furthermore, the central bank's semi-annual outlook on economic activity revealed expectations of lower growth and inflation, limiting the likelihood of any further near-term interest rate increases. The dollar was up 0.6 per cent to Y115.33.  Oil prices rose sharply after a surprise drawdown in US stockpiles. Commodity markets had expected weekly inventory data to show a rise of 400,000 barrels of crude oil following the previous week's massive 5.3m-barrel fall. A further drain of 3.9m barrels last week shocked the market and Nymex West Texas Intermediate jumped Dollars 4.17 to close at a record Dollars 94.55 a barrel, while London's Brent crude climbed Dollars 3.19 to a new record of Dollars 90.63.  Gold prices surged back towards recent 28-year highs as the dollar outlook softened. Spot gold was up 1.3 per cent to Dollars 791.70 an ounce.  Equity markets in Asia and Europe closed before the Fed's rate decision.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index broke a four-day winning streak and edged off its record high as Tuesday's oil price decline took its toll on stocks such as CNOOC and Sinopec.  The index fell 0.9 per cent to 31,352.58.  In Tokyo the Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.5 per cent to 16,737.63, buoyed by gains in financials.

The decision to cut both the funds rate and the discount rate - the rate at which banks borrow from one another - by 25 basis points appeared to disappointed the market.

203,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times,The Short View.,"There were no nasty Hallowe'en surprises from the Fed. The Federal open market committee cut the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent, fulfilling market expectations.  But markets did not behave as this news was already in the price. Stocks sold off, and then resurged. Bond yields rose (suggesting the chances of future rate cuts had reduced). That should help the dollar, but it fell to new record lows.  The keys to this ride lay in the Fed's 173-word statement. The key words are that ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"". So it has no bias, towards tightening or easing.  Is the rest of the statement neutral? The Fed does not declare victory over the credit squeeze, saying only that strains in the money markets have ""eased somewhat on balance"". It also expects economic growth to slow because of the intensifying housing correction. Points for the doves. For the hawks, recent rises in energy and commodity prices ""may put renewed upward pressure on inflation"".  Also note that the Fed did not speak with one voice, as one governor voted not to cut at all.  In short the Fed, like any central bank, does not much want to cut rates. But it plainly fears that it may have to do so.  On balance, the chances of a rate cut at the next two meetings, in December and January, have reduced. That is how Fed Funds futures reacted. On Tuesday, they signalled that a 4.25 per cent Fed Funds rate was a certainty by February. Those odds were slashed by a third after the Fed statement.  So why did the dollar fall? The chances of rate cuts in the eurozone this year look to have been eradicated by yesterday's high inflation reading. The Fed is dependent on the data once more. With more bad housing data, it may cut. Forex traders decided it was still safe to bet against the dollar.  Editorial Comment, Page 10 Markets, Page 34 www.ft.com/shortview"
204,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : View of the day: Base metals.,"Interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are bearish for base metals such as copper and aluminium, says John Reade at UBS. ""The FOMC cut both the Fed funds and discount rates by a further 25 basis points as was widely expected [on Wednesday] helping to underpin base metals and rallies are possible as economic growth will be stimulated.  ""Indeed, this was the case in September when the Fed made a surprise 50bp cut in Fed funds. However, an historical examination of the relationship between US interest rates and base metals prices shows a positive correlation.  ""That is to say, base metals will struggle in an environment of falling interest rates; central banks are cutting because economic growth is weakening.""  Mr Reade notes that: ""The strong rally in base metals over the past six years came amid rising interest rates which were a sign of strengthening economic growth.  ""We are witnessing a synchronised deceleration in global growth exacerbated by the credit crunch and very high oil prices.""  He adds that UBS is sceptical that with the US, Europe and Japan all slowing together, the developing world will be able to de-couple.  ""In conclusion, cuts in Fed funds are bearish for base metals. We are tactically negative on base metals as we do not believe that current prices are discounting slowing global growth expectations.""  "

Citi plunged after an analyst at CIBC World Markets said the bank may be forced to cut its dividend in order to raise capital.  Optimism arising from the Fed's quarter point interest rate cut yesterday was dampened as oil touched $96, reviving inflationary concerns, and ExxonMobil reported a bigger than expected decline in profit.  At mid-morning the S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent at 1545.79. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3 per cent at 2835.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 13734.35. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks fell 2.6 per cent at 806.65.  Citi was trading 7 per cent lower at $38.43 amid concerns over its exposure to credit market problems. An analyst at CIBC World Markets downgraded the bank as she believed the bank will need to raise $30bn in capital in the near term.  Citi may have to cut its dividend or sell assets, analyst Meredith Whitney said, adding that she expects this will pressure the stock significantly lower.""  ""Catch 22 will apply here as selling assets will limit Citigroup's ability to grow earnings, leading us to believe there will be a combined sale and capital raise,"" Ms. Whitney said.  Credit Suisse downgraded the bank from 'outperfom' to 'neutral', citing diminished confidence in the bank's fundamental prospects over the near- and intermediate term.  Financial stocks were punished. The S&P financial index fell 3.7 per cent at 435.64. The investment bank index fell 4.4 per cent at 435.64. Merrill Lynch declined 4.8 per cent at $62.90 while Bank of America shed 3.9 per cent at $46.41.  Credit insurers plunged on fears of an acceleration in the deterioration of US mortgage market. Radian, the mortgage insurer lost 17.4 per cent at $1040. Ambac Financial and MBIA, bond insurers, declined 23.5 per cent at $28.18 and 10.4 per cent at $38.56 respectively.  In earnings news, Exxon Mobil reported a bigger-than-expected 10 per cent decline in its third-quarter earnings as profits from the production of gasoline slipped. It was first time in five years that profit has declined for two consecutive quarters after equipment and power failures slowed fuel output and refining margins narrowed. The shares were trading 3.7 per cent lower at $88.60.  In early economic data, personal income rose 0.4 per cent while personal consumption was up 0.3 per cent. Economists' had forecast a rise of 0.4 per cent for both measures. The personal consumption expenditure index rose 0.2 per cent in September and the core PCE price index rose 1.8 per cent year-over-year and remained below the Fed's 2 per cent ceiling of tolerance for price pressures.  In other data, weekly jobless claims fell 6,000 to 327,000, more than a forecast decline of 1,000. The four-week moving average which presents a smoother picture of labour trends rose 1,750 to 327,000, a six-month high.  The Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturing activity showed that growth deteriorated to its slowest pace since March as tighter credit conditions and a housing downturn proved a drag on production. Its index of U.S. manufacturing fell to 50.9 from 52.0 in September, below economists' median forecast for a dip to 51.5. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.  Stocks rallied sharply late on Wednesday, after the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its Fed funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to 4.50 per cent and signalled that further cuts are now unlikely.  ""After some initial disappointment, equity markets rebounded smartly,"" said Jack Ablin, chief market strategist at Harris Private Bank.  The FOMC's accompanying statement noted ""renewed upward pressure on inflation"" as a result of rising energy and commodity prices, and that ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.""  ""The FOMC has just stated unequivocally that 'we think we are done easing'"", said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ""Whether they are or not remains to be seen, but the message is loud and clear.""  In other earnings news, CVS Caremark, the country's largest pharmacy chain, increased third-quarter to $689.5m, higher than expected by analysts, helped by the addition of Caremark's pharmacy benefits business and increased sales at drugstores open at least a year. Stock traded 1.4 per cent lower at $41.09.  Sprint Nextel, the third-largest mobile operator in the US, reported a lower profit as it lost 60,000 wireless customers in the third quarter. The company, which is searching for a new chief executive, said its profit fell to $64m, from $279 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue declined 4 per cent, missing analysts expectations. The share were 3.5 per cent lower at $16.50.  Office supplies retailer OfficeMax's earnings in the third quarter rose 61 per cent from the same period last year.

""After some initial disappointment, equity markets rebounded smartly,"" said Jack Ablin, chief market strategist at Harris Private Bank.  The FOMC's accompanying statement noted ""renewed upward pressure on inflation"" as a result of rising energy and commodity prices, and that ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.""  ""The FOMC has just stated unequivocally that 'we think we are done easing'"", said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ""Whether they are or not remains to be seen, but the message is loud and clear.""

207,1994-02-04,1994-02-05,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - AMERICA - FED CREDIT CURBS SEND DOW TUMBLING.,"Wall Street US stocks yesterday suffered their worst setback in over two years after the Federal Reserve announced that its policy-making body had decided to tighten credit conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 96.24 at 3,871.42. It was its biggest fall in the single day since November 15, 1991. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 plunged 11.41 to469.81. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 8.89 lower at 478.29, and the Nasdaq composite 20.51 off at 777.28. Volume on the NYSE was very heavy, with 377m shares traded by the close. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 2,032 to 296. After a soft opening, the market went into a tail spin after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that the Federal Open Market Committee had voted to increase pressure on reserve positions, a move associated with a slight rise in short-term rates. Share prices, which have prosperedunder the Fed's long-held policy of accommodation, plunged on the news, with the Dow index falling about 40 points within minutes of the statement. Stocks pulled off of their session lows soon after, helped in part by indications that the Fed would nudge up its target for the key Fed Funds rate by only 25 basis points to 3.25%. While an early move had been expected, the financial markets were nevertheless surprised by the unprecedented announcement of the Fed's intentions. At first, the bond market displayed a cooler reaction than equities in the face of the long-anticipated Fed move, intended to staunch incipient inflationary pressures in the economy. But losses started to mount in the afternoon, especially in the intermediate segment of the maturity range, with the five-year note down 19/32 at 98 21/32 and the yield rising to 5.303% late in the day. When bonds started to sag, the sell-off in stocks accelerated, with the Dow finally hitting bottom at the close. Financial issues and utilities, which are the most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, were among the worst performers. Citicorp was marked down $2 to $40 1/2, Chase Manhattan $1 1/2 to $33 3/4 and Wells Fargo $6 5/8 to $128 7/8. Brokerage houses were also hit hard, with Morgan Stanley dropping $3 5/8 to $74 5/8 and Merrill Lynch shedding $2 3/4 to $41 1/2. Amid the fresh indication that the economy may not have fared as well as expected last month, cyclical issues, including automobile, metals and heavy equipment companies, were also down. General Motors dropped $1 3/8 to $61 5/8, Alcoa $2 1/8 and 3M $2 1/4 to $104 1/2. On the Nasdaq, technology stocks led the retreat. Microsoft lost $3 1/4 to $82 1/4, Sun Microsystems $1 5/8 to $25 1/2 and Wellfleet Communications $3 3/8 to $70 3/8. Canada The Toronto TSE-300 composite index recordedits largest single-day drop since October 1989, in continued heavy trading. It fell 113.09 points, or 2.48%, to 4,447.19, with declines trouncing advances 694 to 194. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
208,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times,Retailers in spotlight as Footsie rallies LONDON.,"The resumption of BP's share buyback programme supported yesterday's rally in the FTSE 100, which closed above 4,600 for the first time since July 2002. London's benchmark index was up 0.6 per cent at 4,608.4, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 fell less than 0.1 per cent to 6,276.5. Trading volume was 3bn ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's decision on US interest rates. Otherwise it was a tale of three retailers - Tesco, Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury. M&S was down 1.2 per cent at 341 1/2p after a weak trading statement revealed like-for-like sales in the past 10 weeks to Sept 18 had fallen 6.3 per cent. The retailer also unveiled its share buyback plan, with the range set between 332p and 380p, lower than expected and below the 400p Philip Green might have offered earlier in the summer. By contrast Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, added 3.5 per cent to 285p, near its highest level in four years after yet another trading statement topped analysts' expectations. Some were forecasting that Tesco would become the first UK retailer to top the Pounds 2bn profit mark. The bullishness of the statement once again threw the troubles at rival J Sainsbury into sharp relief, the latter falling 0.8 per cent to 272 1/2p. Philip Dorgan, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, did not hold back in his assessment of either M&S or Sainsbury. On M&S he said: ""There is no magic wand and we expect to see a stream of downgrades for 2005/06. M&S's problems are structural and will defeat this management team as they have others."" On Sainsbury he was even more damning as he chopped the rating from ""hold"" to ""sell"" and slashed his 2005 forecasts to one half of consensus. Mr Dorgan said: ""The legacy of previous management is far worse than we imagined and Justin King (the new chief executive) has been given a hospital pass. We expect the business review on October 19 to result in very serious downgrades to both earnings and dividends."" BP, the oil major, rose 1.8 per cent to 538p as it recommenced its share buyback programme after a four-week hiatus. The company bought back 10m shares at prices between 520 1/2p and 531p per share. Expectations that rival Shell would announce an increase for its buyback programme sent its shares up 2.3 per cent to 432 1/4p. Technical traders have said the 4,600 level represents a significant breakthrough on the FTSE 100 chart and a close above the 4,610 level could see the index rise by more than a 100 points. This could happen quickly if talk of Vodafone doubling its dividend proves correct. The shares rose 0.8 per cent to 130 1/4p. Royal Bank of Scotland added 1 per cent to Pounds 15.80 after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said further deals involving the issue of new shares are unlikely during the integration of Charter One in the US. The broker concluded that RBS shares should respond positively to the cash generated by that. A downgrade from Credit Suisse First Boston sent LogicaCMG 4 per cent lower to 184p. "
209,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times,Fed adds a quarter point and signals more to come.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target primary interest rate a quarter point to 1.75 per cent and signalled it expects to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement largely unchanged from August, saying that output growth ""appears to have regained some traction"" after ""moderating earlier in the year partly in response to the rise in energy prices"". The statement, which echoed recent testimony by Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, also noted that inflation and inflation expectations had declined recently, in spite of the high oil price. Yesterday's move was widely expected, and reaction was muted. ""Growth has recovered, much as they expected, and inflation has fallen, much as they expected,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""They have not changed the statement and they gave no indication that a pause is needed any time soon."" The Fed has taken care to communicate its message to the market and lay out the expected course of increases to return rates to a more neutral level at a ""pace that is likely to be measured"", widely seen as meaning quarter-point moves. The federal funds rate is seen as too low to be consistent with stable inflation over time. But officials stress that rate moves will be determined by economic data. Futures markets are pricing in a further increase when the Fed meets in November but are betting it will leave rates on hold when it meets close to Christmas before raising them again in February. The market is pricing in about a 3 per cent rate by the end of next year, the lower end of the range for neutral rates commonly seen as 3-5 per cent. Recent economic data have supported the Fed's case that the economy is bouncing back after a soft patch at the end of the second quarter, though the August retail sales data were mixed. The high oil price is seen as a risk, but the Fed has no evidence so far that the oil price has knocked expansion fundamentally off course. Recent weaker job data are also a concern, but the Fed remains confident the labour market has turned the corner and income growth will be strong enough to support growing consumer spending. Yesterday's statement noted ""labour market conditions have improved modestly"" since August.

210,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times,Fed raises rate by quarter point to 1.75% MONETARY POLICY.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target interest rate a quarter point to 1.75 per cent and signalled that it remained on course for further increases. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement largely unchanged, saying that output growth ""appears to have regained some traction"" after ""moderating earlier in the year partly in response to the rise in energy prices"". The committee repeated that it expected to continue to raise the federal funds rate to a more neutral level ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Yesterday's move was widely expected and market reaction was muted. Futures markets are pricing in a further rate increase when the Fed meets in November but are betting the central bank will leave rates on hold when it meets just before Christmas - when trading is likely to be thin - before raising them in February. The FOMC statement echoed recent testimony by Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, who gave cautiously optimistic testimony before Congress this month. Recent economic data have supported the Fed's case that the economy is bouncing back after a soft patch at the end of the second quarter, though the August retail sales data were mixed. The high oil price is seen as a risk but the Fed has seen no evidence so far that the oil price has knocked the expansion fundamentally off course. Recent weaker job data are also a concern, but the central bank remains confident that the labour market has turned the corner this year and that income growth will grow strongly enough to support growing consumer spending. The Fed, in its statement yesterday, noted that ""labour market conditions have improved modestly"" since its August meeting. The decline in inflation and inflation expectations in recent months, in spite of the high oil price, makes it easier for the central bank to pay close attention to the risks that the high oil price poses for growth. The Fed has taken great care to communicate its message to the market this year and lay out the expected course of increases to return rates to a more neutral level at a ""measured pace"", widely interpreted to mean quarter-point moves. The federal funds rate is seen as too low to be consistent with stable inflation over time. But officials have stressed that the timing of rate moves will be determined by the incoming economic data. Since June, before the Fed started raising rates, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen from almost 4.9 per cent to below 4.1. This is seen at the Fed as reflecting the improved outlook for inflation, after fears that the Fed had fallen ""behind the curve"" and would Shave to take aggressive action. "

Severfield-Rowan, the structural steelwork designers, put on 12.7 per cent to 465p after it said it expected full-year results to top market expectations, thanks to increasing demand.

212,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Disappointing corporate news weighs.,"Global equity markets took a turn for the worse on Wednesday as disappointing corporate news and stubbornly high oil prices outweighed the cautiously optimistic view of the US economy delivered by the Federal Reserve when it raised its target interest rate by a quarter-point to 1.75 per cent on Tuesday. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 100 points, or 1.1 per cent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was 1.4 per cent lower. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, saw its shares fall sharply after its third-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, while network equipment maker Cisco Systems was dented by a downgrade from Deutsche Bank. European stocks showed a little more resilience than their US counterparts but the FTSE Eurotop 300 index still ended with a loss of 0.6 per cent at 996.72. Oil prices rose sharply after the latest US crude inventories data showed that the disruption caused by Hurricane Ivan had eroded fuel supplies. Nymex October futures were above $48 a barrel at midday, within striking distance of the all-time high of $49.40 hit last month. The markets may have got what they wanted from the Fed on Tuesday but there was still uncertainty about the timing of the next tightening. ""Currently, the futures market is expecting rates to end the year at 2 per cent and surveys suggest that this is the level that economists generally expect as well,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. ""However, in our view there is a good chance that they will raise rates by 25 basis points at both the November and December FOMC meetings to leave the Fed funds target rate at 2.25 per cent by year-end."" The dollar rallied as investors brushed aside comments by the Fed that inflationary pressures had eased, which had prompted some speculation that the central bank would try to hold back from further rate increases. But Treasury bond prices remained supported by the inflation comments, with the yield on ten-year paper hovering around 4 per cent, a five-month low. Gold gave back all of Tuesday's gains as the dollar staged its recovery. "
213,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar dips as Fed eases inflation concerns.,"The dollar hung around a four-week low against the euro in European morning trade on Wednesday in the aftermath of Tuesday's rate rise by the US Federal Reserve. The Fed, as expected, hiked rate for the third time this cycle, by 25 basis points to 1.75 per cent. However all eyes were on the accompanying statement, and many market participants seized on the suggestion that ""despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months."" Some took this as a signal that the Fed might not, as most analysts previously predicted, deliver further rate hikes in both November and December. ""These comments reinforced the belief that the Federal Open Market Committee will withdraw policy accommodation only one more time this year, raising the federal funds rate an additional 0.25 point following either the November or the December meeting,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, although Mr Chertkow himself does not subscribe to this view. Mr Chertkow added that: ""The characterisation of economic activity appeared less upbeat than the previous characterisation."" In August the FOMC had said that the US economy ""appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion"". On Tuesday that was replaced with ""output growth appears to gave regained some traction"". ""Although the dollar had been sold off earlier on position-squaring prior to the meeting, the market seemingly interpreted the Fed's statement as a signal that the Fed may skip a hike in its return, or potentially back away from hiking rather than accelerating the pace of hikes,"" added Robert Lynch, currency analyst at BNP Paribas. Thus, after 1.5c against the euro on Tuesday, the dollar remained in the doldrums at $1.2272. The greenback also remained weak at SFr1.2605 to the Swiss franc and C$1.2851 versus the Canadian dollar after hitting an eight-month low of $1.2827. The greenback did manage to firm to $1.7907 against sterling, however, with the pound undermined by the release of the minutes of the Bank of England monetary policy committee's meeting earlier this month. As expected, the MPC voted 9-0 to leave rates on hold, but the picture it painted of the UK economy was seen as a touch pessimistic. The committee said the pace of growth in the third quarter ""might be a little slower than had been envisaged"" and that recent labour market data had been ""surprisingly weak"". In addition, there was an ""increasing weight of evidence"" that the housing market was cooling. ""These minutes demonstrate a growing sense of comfort that earlier rate hikes are already doing enough to head off any inflationary bubble,"" said Daragh Maher, senior FX strategist at Calyon. ""Further signs of easing in the housing markets should also head off any hawkish fightback in October."" ""The minutes also mentioned a rising risk of an abrupt correction in the UK housing market, which do little to calm sterling sentiment,"" added Paul Mackel, currency strategist at ABN Amro. Sterling drifted lower to GBP0.6851 against the euro, SFr2.2576 versus the Swiss franc and A$2.5355 against the Australian dollar, a one-month low. "

Alitalia jumped L1,276 to L7,750 on the second day of its capital-raising exercise as investors continued buying a stock widely seen as having significant turnaround potential. The banks were stronger. Banca di Roma rose L96 to L3,670, calling a halt to its slide over the previous two sessions, which followed disappointment that no merger with BCI was planned. BCI was L328 higher at L10,005. Generali jumped L2,091 to L54,900 as Morgan Stanley recommended the stock and set a price target of L65,000 based on the strength of the company in the domestic market and the insurer's prospects in Europe. MADRID was supported by another active session for Endesa, where retail demand stayed strong ahead of next month's formal pricing of the $8bn international privatisation offer. Shares in the utility rose Pta 110 to Pta 3,660 after it was learned that retail investors had already bid more than 1.5 times their allocation of 70% of the total issue. At the close, the general index was 12.72 higher at 868.43. MOSCOW regained its footing after the sharp falls of the past week and the RTS index ended 8.97 higher at 236.58. The rebound came after the central bank stepped in to impose sharp rises in the key refinancing and Lombard rates, which calmed government securities and eased fears in the stock market.

215,1998-05-19,1998-05-20,Financial Times,Gilts take centre stage as Fed holds rates.,"UK gilts stole the show in European bond markets yesterday, see-sawing in reaction to UK inflation figures as other markets held their fire pending a decision from the Federal Reserve on US interest rates. Investors were seen holding back until this morning before taking positions, although the consensus - rightly, as it proved - was for no change in US rates. Analysts said markets were looking further ahead to the release tomorrow of the Federal open market committee's March minutes for indications of any shift in underlying sentiment. Markets ended higher across the board but were locked in tight ranges, having apparently shrugged off the latest political developments in Indonesia. US TREASURY bond prices remained largely unchanged in quiet trading yesterday morning in New York, as traders marked time ahead of the Fed committee meeting. The benchmark 30-year bond was 1/32 higher, at 102 25/32, in early afternoon trading in New York, putting the yield at 5.924%. Two-year notes were unchanged at 100 1/16, leaving the yield at 5.589%. Bond prices held on to their gains of the day before, which followed the rising dollar. The long bond yield remains about 10 basis points below its level of late last month, reflecting receding fears that a US rate rise might be imminent and a partial return of its status as a safe haven. UK GILTS initially took fright at higher than expected retail price index data, falling sharply after it appeared these spelled a resurgence of inflation and concern over a possible interest rate rise. The statistics office said headline inflation hit a six-year high of 4%, up from 3.5% in March. In addition, the April retail price index came in above forecasts at 3%, against a forecast of between 2.8% and 2.9%. That, coupled with last week's average earnings data which showed a bigger rise than had been expected, helped stoke fears that the Bank of England's year-end inflation target of 2.5% may be unrealistic. The short end of the yield curve saw some flattening as short-dated bonds were hit, with economists predicting more of the same if tomorrow's retail sales figures are perceived as strong. However, gilts recovered after concluding the headline figure was boosted by Budget items and that there were still no convincing reasons to alter current views on interest rates. ""For once I think the markets are listening to the economists rather than the headlines. It's clear the acceleration in the headline index is a one-off,"" said Julian Jessop, European economist at Nikko. Nevertheless, there are still lingering fears that the headline figure may encourage wage deals that are inflationary. Yesterday, retailer Marks &Spencer fuelled such concerns by announcing a a 5.25% staff pay rise. ""It (today's official data) doesn't change our view that interest rates are more likely to remain at 7.25% for the rest of the year than to rise, but the risks are still on the upside,"" said Steven Andrew, gilt strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""The problem is that the higher number may feed through to inflationary pressures at a later stage. The ball we should be watching is the labour market."" The June gilt future settled 11 basis points higher at 107.78 with 76,000 contracts traded. Figures showing that the government had been able to repay #3.4bn in debt - largely thanks to robust tax revenues - was seen pushing gilt prices higher, as it would reduce the need for further auctions and point to the prospect of scarce supply. The spread over German bunds narrowed to 104 from the previous day's 105 basis points. BUNDS ended higher, hardly reacting to comments by Ernest Welteke, a Bundesbank council member, warning a small interest rate rise could not be ruled out, though it was too early to speculate when to make any adjustment. The IFO business climate data were slightly weaker than expected but analysts said the market had already priced this into their expectations, as weak production data had told a similar story last week. The June bund future settled 13 basis points higher at 106.95 after nudging technical resistance at 106.98. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

216,2001-11-06,2001-11-07,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed cuts rates to 40-year low.,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday took another bold step in its aggressive efforts to revive the US economy, cutting short-term interest rates once again by 0.5 percentage points to their lowest level in almost four decades. The central bank's policymaking open market committee slashed its key monetary policy instrument - its target for the federal funds rate - to 2 per cent, and hinted of more to come. The Fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate by the same amount to 1.5 per cent. ""Heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity,"" the FOMC said on announcing the move. In opting for a half-point cut, the FOMC seemed to brush aside concerns among some economists that it might have been overly aggressive in reducing rates already and should move instead by a more cautious 0.25 percentage point cut. Short-term rates have now fallen from 6.5 per cent a year ago to 2 per cent. Using its standard verbal formula that for the foreseeable future, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness"", the Fed indicated it stood ready to cut rates again, and financial markets immediately began to price in the probability of rates falling below 2 per cent by early next year. Investors cheered the Fed's move as stocks erased earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 150.09 to 9,591.12 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 41.44 to 1,835.09. While expressing concern about the deteriorating immediate prospects for the US economy, the Fed reiterated its belief that longer-term prospects remained good, although they might be affected by business responses to the terrorist attacks of September 11. For the first time in a decade, the Fed's monetary policymakers met yesterday amid firm evidence that the US economy was in recession. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in the three months to September, and the early figures published so far for employment, consumer confidence and manufacturing in October suggested output plunged lower last month. And on Tuesday, several members of the National Bureau of Economic Research - the body that historically sets official dates for US business cycles - said they were actively discussing the possibility of officially declaring the first US recession in a decade. Tuesday's rate cut takes overnight interest rates below most estimates of annual consumer price inflation, meaning the real cost of short-term borrowing is now negative. Real short term rates have not been below zero for an extended period since the 1970s. Additional reporting by Peronet Despeignes. "
217,2003-09-15,2003-09-16,Financial Times,FOMC meet takes spotlight on Wall St AMERICAS.,"Wall Street traded lower in a quiet session as investors looked ahead to today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the coming earnings season. ""Today's action is just treading water,"" said Ned Riley, global strategist for State Street Global Advisors. ""There's little to go on in terms of corporate news, and the intent of the Fed going forward is on investors' minds. This period can be notoriously dangerous for the market, being the last month of a quarter, and given the amount of negativity that surrounds pre-announcements."" He said he expects a better quarter than earlier in the year, noting that the ratio of downgrades to upgrades has improved. For example, 60 per cent of revisions in profits forecasts for technology companies have been higher. Yet this winning streak did little to improve investors' attitudes towards the sector, which was hit by profit taking. The S&P 500 semiconductor and equipment maker sector slid 1.6 per cent, the biggest loss on the index. Altera led the group lower, down 3.2 per cent to $21.25. Applied Micro Circuits was off 3.3 per cent to $5.50, while PCM-Sierra followed, down 3.2 per cent to $13.54. The negative sentiment toward the sector would not be deterred, with Applied Materials shares slipping 1.9 per cent to $20.58 despite an upbeat note from Merrill Lynch. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 22.74 to 9,448.81, while the broader S&P 500 was down 3.83 to 1,014.80. The Nasdaq fell 9.33 to 1,845.70. While the FOMC meeting is the highlight of the week's economic calendar, manufacturing activity was again under scrutiny at the start of the week. Industrial output rose 0.1 per cent in August - less than the previous month's upwardly revised 0.7 per cent increase - as summer shutdowns and holidays, reflected in the pullback in manufacturing payrolls, hit the sector. Analysts expected a rise of 0.3 per cent. But the September Empire State index of manufacturing in New York beat expectations to move further into the expansion zone as factories reopened after the summer. The New York Federal Reserve district reported a fifth consecutive rise, with the index hitting 18.35, from 9.98 in August. By the close, the losses were spread across the S&P 500, with most sectors posting slides of 1 per cent or less. But the day was not without bright spots. Alphapharma, the generic drug maker, joined the ranks of biotechs to post gains on the back of new drug news. Shares rose 7.4 per cent to $20.23 after the company announced late on Friday that it received US regulatory approval for its version of Neurontin, Pfizer's epilepsy drug. Elsewhere in the sector, Vaxgen continued to benefit from an announcement on Friday that research indicated that its smallpox vaccination may help prevent HIV. Traders said it was also buoyed among retail investors by a perception the company could benefit from US government spending on vaccines to combat terrorist attacks. Shares added 23.9 per cent to $8.05. Golden State Vintners,a small California winery, was another winner, leaping 44.2 per cent to $3 after announcing a reverse share split. Footstar, a maker of athletic shoes, declined by 17 per cent to $8.65 after the company's chairman and chief executive resigned over an accounting discrepancy. The company plans to restate financials from 1997 to 2002, which are expected to reduce earnings in that period. Elsewhere in retail, investors were feeling more comfortable with consumer spending and the sector posted gains of 1.5 per cent, the best performance on the S&P 500. Home Depot, the home improvement chain, added 3.8 per cent to $32.78, while rival Lowe's climbed 2.4 per cent to $52.70 as investors bet on homeowners in the US north-east buying hurricane-proof articles ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Isabel, which is currently off the coast.

218,2003-09-15,2003-09-16,Financial Times,Fed expected to leave rates on hold FOMC MEETING.,"The US Federal Reserve's open market committee meets today amid wide expectation among investors that it will leave interest rates on hold at 1 per cent. Futures markets yesterday were pricing in a probability of around 5 per cent that the FOMC would raise rates by a quarter-point, underlining the consensus among investors and economists that they will remain on hold for the next few months. Data released yesterday continued the slightly disappointing tone of figures released last week, showing that the Fed's view that the economy is moving into a sustained period of faster growth remains at risk. Industrial production in the US edged 0.1 per cent higher in August, below economists' expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise. The new figure, however, was offset partially by an upward revision of July's increase, to 0.7 per cent, from the previously announced 0.5 per cent. Most forecasters still think the US economy is gathering steam. The National Association of Business Economists said yesterday a survey of forecasters had raised their expectations for growth, with predictions for 2004 rising to 4 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in the previous survey in May. In its regular report on its members' expectations, the NABE said consumer spending and business investment would rise more quickly than previously thought. But the panel reduced its expectations for growth in corporate profits. Speaking at the NABE's annual meeting, Greg Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, said: ""Most of the recent news has been better than we expected. The signs of a rebound are now numerous."" But it could be a while before the improvements feed through to increases in interest rates. While most officials in the Fed share Wall Street's confidence that the economic recovery is gaining momentum, they have so far seen little evidence companies are regaining pricing power and that inflation is likely to take off. Accordingly, it would be a shock if the FOMC did anything other than leave rates on hold today. One possibility is that the Fed will tweak further the wording of the statement it will release with its decision, which is likely to attract most of the interest when it announces today's decision. After the disappointing reaction in June - when investors responded to a statement they regarded as ambiguous by ratcheting up long-term rates - the Fed has been at pains to try and fine-tune its language. It has tried to give the clearest possible indication that the risk of falling inflation is its dominant concern, and that rates are likely to be kept low for the foreseeable future until this risk has dissipated. Markets have taken this with some scepticism, continuing to price in substantial rises in rates next year, in the belief that the Fed will find itself compelled to raise borrowing costs relatively soon. As part of the assessment of its communications strategy, the Fed is continuing to review its practice - adopted earlier this year - of giving separate assessments of the balance of risk around inflation and growth. Although that review seems unlikely to reach definitive conclusions soon, some of the thinking within the process may well emerge during its course and be reflected in FOMC statements. In a separate report yesterday, the US current account deficit in the second quarter was nearly unchanged at $138.7bn (Euros 122bn, £86bn), holding near the record set in the first quarter.

220,2003-09-15,2003-09-16,Financial Times,LEX COLUMN - FOMC THE LEX COLUMN.,"It is an overwhelming probability that the Federal open market committee will leave interest rates unchanged when it meets today. The evidence pointing to a third-quarter growth spurt has accumulated since the last meeting. It is no clearer whether this will prove to be sustainable. But, if committee members happen to feel creative, then a definition of what the FOMC sees as price stability would be an invaluable addition to every market participant's tool kit. Though the yield on 10-year bonds is returning to a more sensible level, the market is still pricing in one percentage point of Fed tightening by the end of next year - at odds with the FOMC's on-hold rhetoric. The committee's somewhat schizophrenic policy stance may be part of the problem. The FOMC states that the risks to sustainable growth are balanced, while the remote threat of deflation outweighs any concern about inflation. Third quarter growth will be supported by strong consumer spending, supported by tax cuts and the last legs of the mortgage refinancing cycle. Any disappointment in August's retail sales data stems from the inability of Detroit auto manufacturers to sell cars for a profit. There are some positive signs on the capital spending front. What is missing is a labour market recovery. A jobless recovery is not sustainable, as households will eventually raise precautionary saving, and another period of sub-par growth will put the productivity record to the test. If the remote deflation risk is of greater concern than inflation, this derives from the danger than the current spurt will be followed by a return to sub-par growth. It does not obviously make sense to split the two risks. Further note on San Miguel at www.ft.com/lex London Edition 1. "

US TREASURIES rose modestly on the Federal Reserve's confirmation of that in the afternoon and traded narrowly as expected. The benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 3/16 to 98,sending the yield down to 6.720%. Two-year notes were unchanged at 99 15/16, yielding 6.016%, while the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 7/16, to yield 6.416%. While most analysts had expected the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged for now, some believe rates could go higher after the Fed's August meeting. Helping keep prices higher in morning trading was a fall in May factory orders, which slid 0.7% - a steeper decline than analysts were expecting. It follows a revised 1.4-per cent increase in orders for April. In Europe, GERMAN BUNDS led the way, with the September bund breaking through the 102 barrier. The future touched an intra-day high of 102.17 before finally settling at 102.02, up 0.14 on the day. Analysts said the 102 level was ""a relatively important"" resistance level, but pointed out that the bund market had also been bolstered by weaker than expected May industrial production data. These showed a monthly 0.2% fall, compared with monthly 0.3% rise in April. The new 30-year bund was relatively well received, according to Mr Heinz Gunasekera, analyst at UBS, with investors buying the new issue to replace the previous January 2024 benchmark issue. However, Mr Gunasekera pointed out that the demand came almost entirely from trading accounts and not from end-investors, who continue to be wary of 30 year bonds. ITALIAN BTPs were the day's star performer, gaining on renewed enthusiasm about Italy's entry to the European single currency. The September BTP future touched a new contract high of 135.20 before settling at 135.02, up 0.62 on the day. The yield spread over bunds, which has been closing in since the Amsterdam summit in mid-June, gained another six basis points to 108 basis points. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the convergence trades had ""plenty of momentum left"" and enthusiasm about Italy was reinforced by expectation that there could be further interest rate cuts, following last Friday's half-point cut to 6.25%. FRENCH OATs also gained ground. The September notional future touched a new contract high of 129.72 before settling at 129.66, up 0.24 on the day. Traders warned, however, that profits might be taken this morning ahead of the auction of a new 10-year 5.5% OAT.

The September gilt future had settled at 114 25/32 but then plunged a full point to 113 25/32, though it later recovered slightly to 113. The yield spread over bunds widened 10 basis points to 157 basis points as traders registered disappointment. ""The market had got ahead of itself in recent days, expecting the chancellor to pull a rabbit out of the hat, but he didn't,"" said Mr Andrew Roberts, analyst at UBS. Another analyst said that the Budget announcements of additional petrol duty, an increase in stamp duty and a slight cut in mortgage interest tax relief were far short of expectations. Mr Kevin Adams, analyst at BZW, said: ""This Budget has not done enough to restrain what could be some very strong consumer spending numbers in the coming months."" He repeated his forecast that interest rates would be 7.25-7.50% in about a year. ""I think we may get there rather faster than expected than if this Budget had taken consumer spending to task,"" he said. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

""The market had got ahead of itself in recent days, expecting the chancellor to pull a rabbit out of the hat, but he didn't,"" said Mr Andrew Roberts, analyst at UBS. Another analyst said that the Budget announcements of additional petrol duty, an increase in stamp duty and a slight cut in mortgage interest tax relief were far short of expectations. Mr Kevin Adams, analyst at BZW, said: ""This Budget has not done enough to restrain what could be some very strong consumer spending numbers in the coming months."" He repeated his forecast that interest rates would be 7.25-7.50% in about a year. ""I think we may get there rather faster than expected than if this Budget had taken consumer spending to task,"" he said. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

224,1999-02-03,1999-02-04,Financial Times,US AND CANADA - Fed leaves short-term rates unchanged.,"The Federal Reserve's key policymaking committee left short-term interest rates unchanged at the end of a two-day meeting yesterday. The decision by the federal open market committee to leave the Fed funds target rate at 4.75% was widely expected but came amid growing concerns among policymakers about the continuing frenetic pace of US growth. The central bank cut the Fed funds rate by 0.75 percentage points last autumn in three rapid-fire changes in response to international and domestic financial turmoil. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, argued the rate cuts were necessary to prevent significant dislocations in financial markets and a possible sharp slowdown in growth. But since the last rate cut in November, the economy has actually accelerated - output growth in the fourth quarter of last year hit a two-year high of 5.6% at an annualised rate. The rate cuts also seemed to have imparted a new momentum to stock prices - broad measures of equity prices have risen by about 10% since the November meeting. A number of FOMC members have already expressed concerns about the strength of the economy and the stock market. The surge in equity prices and an explosion of money supply since that meeting have heightened concerns that domestic imbalances in the economy are growing. At their last meeting in December, committee members voted not to change rates. Yesterday's decision to leave rates unchanged again indicates the clear majority of committee members remain confident that, in spite of the strong growth signals, the US still faces few inflationary pressures. Even as growth accelerated at the end of last year, the broadest measure of inflation fell to its lowest annual rate for 40 years. But financial markets will be on the alert for any signs that members may have agreed to shift their policy stance at yesterday's meeting. When it cut rates in November the committee moved to a neutral stance, having previously been biased towards easing. If committee members voted yesterday to shift to a tightening bias, it may indicate a rise in interest rates could come soon. The committee's decision on the policy stance yesterday will not be made public formally until after the next meeting in March, but members are expected to give hints in the next few weeks about which way the Fed is now leaning.

226,1999-02-03,1999-02-04,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Dow climbs ahead of Fed rate decision.,"Wall Street shrugged off a cautious morning to send leading shares higher in early afternoon trading, ahead of the Federal open market committee's announcement that interest rates would not be changing this month, writes John Labate in New York. The breadth of the day's buying was focused on key stocks, with the number of advancing shares only slightly ahead of declining ones on the New York stock exchange. The main indices were higher, however, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 50.72 or 0.6% at 9,324.84 and the Standard &Poor's 500 index climbing 4.29 to 1,266.28. The Nasdaq composite index, weighted in high-tech shares, was 15.69 higher at 2,479.11. US bonds traded higher as well after the Treasury announced plans to auction $35bn in notes and bonds next week. By early afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond was 1/4 higher at 100 5/16, sending the yield down to 5.229%. Among Dow stocks, Goodyear Tire and Rubber gained $1 5/8 to $51 7/8 after the company confirmed reports that it would enter an alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries of Japan. Boeing was also higher in early trading, gaining $1 3/16 to $35 3/8. Among declining stocks, Minnesota Mining &Manufacturing lost $2 to $73 7/8 and Union Carbide fell $15/16 to $38 5/8. Online trading stocks were mixed, with E*Trade down $2 3/16 to $56 1/16 after the company confirmed it had experienced an outage for one and a quarter hours during the morning. A company spokesperson said the problem had been resolved soon after. Rival Ameritrade Holdings was up $11 3/4 to $122 1/16. Shares of Patriot American Hospitality were $7/16 or 8.6% higher at $5 1/2 after a report that the company was in talks with Hilton Hotels. Hilton was down $1/8 to $14 1/4. In the brokerage sector Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was more than 4% or $4 5/16 higher to 93 1/2 on speculation that the company was in takeover talks with banker Chase Manhattan. Perot Systems, the information technology company led by Ross Perot, gained $16 1/2 to $59 a day after its initial public offering at $16 a share. TORONTO added to Tuesday's declines in early trading with a shakeout among gold stocks mostly dictating direction. The 300 composite index at noon was off 13.28 at 6,670.50 in below average volumes. A soft start for the bullion price overshadowed golds and sector leaders pushed lower from the opening bell. Barrick fell 75 cents to C$29.15 and Placer Dome came off 35 cents at C$17.45. Banks were mixed. Royal Bank of Canada shed 65 cents at C$78.35 and Bank of Nova Scotia 40 cents at C$32.50. Toronto-Dominion Bank, in contrast, improved C$1.15 to C$65 while Canadian Imperial added 15 cents at C$38.35. Paper stocks made a weak start with Domtar off 15 cents at C$8.85 and MacMillan-Bloedel slipping 40 cents to C$14.90. In telecoms, BCE hardened 20 cents to C$65.70.

227,1999-02-03,1999-02-04,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Fed news fails to impress.,"European markets were lower yesterday while US Treasuries were mixed in early afternoon trading as the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged despite strong economic growth. The benchmark 30-year bond was 3/32 higher at 100 5/32, sending the yield lower to 5.239%. The 10-year note fell 1/32 to 99 9/16, yielding 4.806% and the two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8, yielding 4.7%. Analysts said the Fed fought shy of a sudden change in interest rates, given the fragile state of emerging markets. The US Treasury caught traders by surprise, saying it would auction $35bn of notes and bonds next week. The Treasury said it would auction $15bn in five-year notes, $10bn in 9 3/4 - year notes, and $10bn in 30-year notes. ""They are concerned that trading in the 10-year note has become scarce in the repo market, so they want to alleviate that by reopening the 10-year note,"" said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson in New York. The Treasury decided to issue a new bond rather than reopen the current 30-year and said two-and 30-year auctions may become less frequent. European bond markets sold off in expectation of today's meeting of the European Central Bank, which will determine interest rates in the euro-zone. Most analysts doubt the ECB will cut interest rates. David Knott, at Deutsche Bank, said the markets had been too optimistic by pricing in two interest rate cuts by September. Germany's 10-year bond future fell through the 117 level, closing 0.44 down at 116.75. UK gilts took their cue from euro-zone countries. The 10-year gilt future dropped 0.46 closing at 119.43. Most observers expect the Monetary Policy Committee to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Yields on Japanese government bonds continued to climb but at a slower pace. The yield on the benchmark 10-year 203 bond rose slightly to 2.335%. Mr Knott argued that provided short-term interest rates stayed unchanged at 0.5% and acted as an ""anchor"" to the yield curve, 10-year JGB yields were unlikely to rise much higher. He likened Japan to the US in 1993, when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and let the curve steepen. This allowed US banks to recapitalise by borrowing short-term money at low rates and lending it longer term at higher rates. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

228,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,*** No headline found ***.,"The June FTSE 100 future spent much of the day trading sideways but received a powerful push from Wall Street just before the close, writes Martin Brice. June had opened at 5,960, which was 53 points above the cash market with fair value variously estimated at a premium of between 63 and 69 points. June edged up to the 5,974 region, before easing to the 5,955 area before 9.30am, and these levels were to set the restrained tone for trading during much of the day. The FOMC meeting in the US and the continued strength of sterling tended to encourage this restrained tone, and suggestions from trading in the S&P futures that the US market would move ahead just a few points tended to reinforce caution. June touched the low of the day, 5,933, ahead of the US opening, but in the event Wall Street was stronger than anticipated and the contract found a spring in its step. The one-hour shift in UK time left just 40 minutes of pit trading between the US opening and settlement, which was at 5,967. After-hours electronic trading saw June reach 6,008. Volume was 20,200, or 8,000 in the old contract size. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
229,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Dollar lifts Zurich exporters.,"A strong dollar and window dressing at the end of the first quarter sent ZURICH back into record territory, although analysts cautioned the market looked increasingly overbought and a correction remained on the cards. The SMI index rose 49.2 to 7,585.5, eclipsing the previous peak set last Friday. Exporters gaining from the firmer dollar included Novartis. It jumped SwFr 36 to SwFr 2,710 and was was also recommended by Zurich Kantonalbank as a trading buy. Roche certificates added SwFr 150 to SwFr 16,500, still recovering from last week's losses, and Ems Chemie, SwFr 80 higher at SwFr 7,995. Nestle jumped SwFr 31 to SwFr 2,913 as CSFB reiterated its buy recommendation and raised its 1998 earnings estimates. It was the turn of CS Group to outperform the financial sector with a rise of SwFr 4.50 to SwFr 305. SAir Group, which on Monday said it was cautiously optimistic about 1998 prospects, rose SwFr 22 to SFDr2,129. Food company Hero, which said it expected higher 1998 profit, rose SwFr 15 to SwFr 965. PARIS, too, rallied to a fresh closing high in spite of a mixed reaction to the Opec agreement to reduce oil production. Total lost FFr 11 to FFr 744, but Elf, which announced a boost to its reserves with 15 new offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, was marked FFr 11 higher at FFr 812. Elsewhere, Eridania Beghin-Say, the Franco-Italian food group, rose FFr 42 or 3.5% to FFr 1,240 after announcing net profit for 1997 at the top end of analysts' forecasts. Retailer Pinault-Printemps surged FFr 370 or 8.4% as the group denied more market rumours it was planning to sell its Printemps department stores. A FFr 21.10 or 4.6% rise in Schneider to FFr 477 was attributed to its relatively high proportion of dollar earnings. Bouygues rose FFr 35 to FFr 1,080 ahead of its results announcement expected after the market's close. AGF gave up FFr 4.30 to FFr 348.70 on profit-taking. Analysts said that the share was overbought on Monday after a series of recent broker upgrades. The CAC-40 index closed with a gain of 75.58 at 3,875.81. MILAN was supported by a switch out of bonds into equities and the benchmark Mibtel index reached a fresh high. The index rose 280 or 1.2% to 24,583, with banking shares stronger. Credit Italiano rose L315 to L9,045 after the release of its 1997 earnings, while Banca Intesa added L892 to L11,376. FRANKFURT kept the motor stocks firmly in its headlights on a day in which the broad market managed only a modest advance. The Xetra Dax index was just 27.36 higher at the close of electronic trade at 5,097.25, with investors reluctant to commit fresh funds ahead of the US Federal open market committee. BMW dropped DM 67.50 to DM 2,050.95 in the wake of 1997 and first quarter results, with the carmaker's plans to take over Rolls-Royce Motor Cars still weighing on its shares. Analysts said that while the results were mostly in line with expectations, news that an overvalued pound had significantly hurt results in its Rover division caused some concern. Volkswagen, which declined to comment on reports that it might raise its offer for the UK luxury carmaker, fell DM 34 to DM 1,425. AMSTERDAM was hit by profit-taking in low-volume trade and the AEX index lost 2.57 to 1,126.43. Concerns of oil price volatility hurt Royal Dutch. The group, which owns 60% of Royal Dutch Shell, lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 118. Grolsch, the brewer, was supported by speculation the company could become a takeover target, and rose Fl 4.30 to Fl 59.80. Tulip, the computer maker, plunged Fl 2.10 to Fl 5.10 on reports that it was seeking state aid. MADRID edged marginally higher in spite of weakness in Telefonica. The general index rose 1.08 to 888.67 as Telefonica, which lost Pta100 to Pta6,920, wiped out strength in banks and utilities. Argentaria rose Pta100 to Pta13,000, while Popular gained Pta250 to Pta15,150. ATHENS pulled back as foreign investors took to the sidelines and local funds unloaded stock after the market's spectacular run. The general index, up almost 50% since February 26, dropped 78.07 or 3.8% to 2,005.82. Cement stocks were marked down as ABN Amro recommended Titan and Heracles General, saying that they would continue to outperform the market. Sustained growth in cement demand and the shift from exports to domestic sales would result in a further widening of their operating margins. Titan lost Dr1,717 to Dr23,360 and Heracles was off Dr490 at Dr7,510. COPENHAGEN finished at a record high, fuelled by solid gains for selected stocks in an otherwise mixed market. The KFX top 20 index rose 1.96 to 244.86. A government pledge to close a corporate tax loophole which has allowed some financials to reduce their tax burden hit Den Danske Bank, DKr4 down at DKr921, Tryg-Baltica, which lost DKr18 to DKr554, and Cowdan, which gave up DKr4 to DKr1,250. OSLO fell 1% on weaker oil prices as scepticism spread over Opec's production cut agreement. The Total index fell 14.4 to 1,362.44, led down by oil-related companies. Norsk Hydro fell NKr7 to NKr378 and Saga Petroleum lost NKr5 to NKr136. Written and edited by Michael Morgan, Emiko Terazono, Peter Hall and Paul Gregan Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

However, trade was slow on mixed reactions to the Opec deal to cut output and as the market waited for the Federal open market committee to review US interest rate policy. By midsession, the IPC index was 19.27 higher at 5,057.73. CSFB has increased Mexico's weighting in its Latin American portfolio, at the expense of Brazil and Argentina.

231,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Dow surges as FOMC meets on rate policy.,"US shares traded higher at midsession as the Federal Reserve's open market committee met to determine interest rate policy, writes John Labate in New York. At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had surged 81.96 to 8,864.08, while the broader Standard &Poor's 500 gained 12.14 or 1.1% to 1,105.69. Falling oil prices ignited the transport sector. Airline stocks made steady advances as UAL, parent to United Airlines, gained $2 1/4 to $92 and AMR shot up $3 1/16 to $142 1/8. Federal Express rose $2 1/2 to $70 3/4. Bond prices also moved higher after the release of the Chicago purchasing managers report. Although the report showed a rise in economic activity, especially in employment and shipments, the closely watched prices-paid component was sharply lower, suggesting that inflation remains well contained. By midday the price of the benchmark 30-year bond was 7/16 higher at 102 15/32, sending the yield to 5.946%. Banking and other financial shares rose as bond prices rallied in morning trade. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's banking index shot up 18.92 or 2.3% to 852.52. Citicorp gained $3 5/16 to $143, while Bank of New York rose $2 3/8 to $63 3/16. In the Dow, Allied Signal gained $1 3/16 to $42 11/16, while Boeing rose $1 3/8 to $51 7/8 and United Technologies advanced $2 3/8 to $93 5/16. But Philip Morris was lower, off $1 1/4 to $41 7/8 the day after a congressional committee announced new tobacco proposals. The technology and small-cap sectors moved ahead. The Nasdaq composite was up 18.04 or 0.99% to 1,836.74, and the Russell 2000 index climbed 3.18 higher to 479.42. Semiconductor shares were especially strong. Motorola surged $2 7/16 to $59 7/8 and Advanced Micro Devices jumped more than 8% or $2 1/4 to $28. Dell Computer rose $1 3/8 to $68 9/16 and Gateway 2000 gained $1 1/16 to $47 1/8. TORONTO was lifted by a strong banking sector and the TSE 300 composite index rose 27.78 by midsession to 7,595.69, shrugging off weakness in resource stocks. The quarter-end portfolio shuffling by money managers also supported share prices. Financials and industrials were both 0.7% higher, but price concerns hit oil and gas.

232,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Funds injection boosts Nikkei.,"A last-minute injection of public funds into the futures market boosted share prices in TOKYO on the last day of trading for the fiscal year, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. However, the Nikkei 225 index ended far short of the 18,000 level, widely regarded as an important benchmark. The Nikkei traded erratically throughout the day. On the positive side was the expectation that public funds would come in to support stock prices. A comment by the head of the government's tax commission calling for tax cuts of Y 10,000bn also spurred positive sentiment. Purchases by public funds were noticed towards the end of the session in the futures market, which triggered arbitrage buying in the cash market. Post office funds reportedly handed Y 971.2bn to trust banks to invest in the stock market. At the same time, however, substantial selling came from financial institutions reducing their cross-shareholdings at the year-end. After a turbulent session, in which the Nikkei moved between a low of 116,178.22 and a high of 16,584.62, the index closed 246.13 higher at 16,527.17. Volume rose to 650m shares, up from 395m on Monday. Winners outnumbered losers 678 to 477 with 103 issues unchanged. The Topix index rose 10.43 to 1,251.70. Nippon Steel gained Y 1 to Y 214 on news that it would use reserves to buy back up to 150m of its own shares, valued at about Y 32bn. The yen's persistent weakness supported exporters such as Honda, which gained Y 180 to Y 4,800. MANILA lost 1.6% as investors became cautious following a drop in Asian currencies and ahead of the US Federal open market committee meeting. The composite index fell 35.38 to 2,238.42, also under pressure from profit-taking in some issues that have done particularly well recently. Among blue chips, PLDT lost 15 pesos to 1,055 pesos and Ayala Land slipped 50 centavos to 18.25 pesos. The heavily traded Metro Pacific fell 6 centavos to 2.34 pesos after it denied rumours of a possible merger between its telephone business, Smart Communications, and Pilipino Telephone. BANGKOK traded lower as investors unloaded bank and finance issues after the central bank tightened rules on loans for local banks that are likely to force them to raise their capital. The SET composite index was marked down for the sixth straight trading day, losing 5.98 or 1.3% to 459.11. Analysts said sentiment was weak even before the government's announcement, after Moody's lowered the long-term subordinated debt ratings and financial strength ratings of the country's five largest banks. That outweighed comments by Mark Mobius, who runs the $15bn emerging markets fund of US financial group, Templeton Worldwide, that large, well-capitalised Thai and Indonesian banks could be big winners from the Asian financial crisis. Bangkok Bank fell Bt3.50 to Bt81.50 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt2 to Bt75.50. SINGAPORE saw late selling after SIA dismissed speculation that it was about to announce plans to merge its foreign and local share tranches. SIA originally said a decision would be made by the end of March and rumours of a briefing led traders to believe that a merger announcement was imminent. SIA local closed unchanged at S$9.30, having touched a high of S$9.65, while SIA foreign finished 20 cents lower at S$11.50, off a low of S$11.40. Property stocks extended losses seen since the end of last week as profit-taking continued. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 19.38 weaker at S$1,629.18.

233,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Investors await news on US rates.,"Prices ended mixed yesterday as investors awaited the outcome of a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US interest rate policy. Although no rate rise was expected, there was an air of caution about whether the Fed would shift its bias towards higher rates. European markets were also interest rate-sensitive after Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, seemed to signal that further cuts in rates would come at a slower pace than expected because the country's economic growth was so strong. Mr Rojo did not rule out further cuts, and the Spanish central bank is still expected to ease its money market rates in the next few weeks because of continued good inflation figures and European monetary union factors. Analysts said, however, that the prospect of no rate cut in Spain this week would hit hopes that Italian rates would also come down. ""Some central bank governors clearly do not want to be rushed into cutting rates while they are still keeping inflation in check. Given the strength of the Spanish economy and potential inflation, there are serious doubts whether Spanish interest rates should be cut now,"" said Jeremy Hawkins, at Bank of America. Mr Rojo's comments hit SPANISH BONOS, which under-performed other European markets in fairly active trading, with the short end taking the brunt. The June future settled unchanged at 108.82 with 105,000 contracts exchanged. The future had been as low as 108.55 but recovered when European markets perked up after the US posted good early gains. ITALIAN BTPs were also undermined in quiet trading but closed well above the day's lows. The June future settled at 119.11, up 0.02, with 55,000 contracts changing hands, while in the cash market the yield spread over 10-year bunds ended at 28 basis points. GERMAN BUNDS were range-bound, with investors awaiting results from the FOMC meeting, but they later firmed with Treasuries on the back of more US figures confirming the lack of inflation in the economy. The June future settled 0.10 higher in London at 107.30, while in Frankfurt turnover was active at 350,000 contracts. UK GILTS were better, outperforming bunds as sterling continued to soar - it climbed above DM 3.10 early in the day before falling back. Analysts said the outlook for gilts in the context of the strong pound was good, because the possibility of another interest rate rise was minimised. The June gilt future settled 11/32 higher at 108 3/16 with 80,000 contracts traded on Liffe by early evening, while the spread over 10-year bunds contracted sharply to 106 basis points. US TREASURIES were higher in morning trading. By early afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond had gained 1/2 to 102 17/32, sending the yield lower to 5.942%. The two-year note rose 1/16 to 99, yielding 5.600%, while the 10-year note gained 9/32 to 98, yielding 5.670%. Despite expectations that the Fed will not raise rates in the near term, the market has been weaker in recent weeks as the latest economic data have failed to show evidence of economic slowdown. A report by the Chicago Purchasing Managers yesterday continued to point to robust growth. The Chicago business barometer rose to 59.5 in March, from 57.8 in February, but the bond market focused on the prices paid component. Prices paid dipped to 48.7 from 55.5. ""The bond market was thrilled to see signs of disinflation in this morning's Chicago report,"" said Patrick Dimick, treasury market analyst at UBS Securities. * The UK debt management office takes over responsibility for gilt market operations today from the Bank of England.

234,2000-11-15,2000-11-16,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Forex market waits for ECB decision.,"The euro, after three days of plain sailing, returns to the spotlight today as the European Central Bank makes its fortnightly rate decision. The European currency kept a low profile yesterday as the market waited for the Federal Open Market Committee to comment on its monetary policy bias. It did, however, capitalise briefly on confusion in Asian trade. A Japanese news agency reported that Lawrence Lindsey, advisor to George W. Bush, had told Japanese politicians that a Bush government could seek a weaker dollar to help curb the current account deficit. A senior spokesman for the Bush campaign subsequently denied the account, saying: ""A Japanese politician is misattributing what Mr Lindsey said. Mr Lindsey has been consistent and unequivocal in saying that Governor Bush would continue to pursue a strong dollar policy."" The dollar climbed steadily against the yen, from below Y108.00 to a peak of around Y108.80. Traders identified some short-term speculative selling of the yen on the hope that Japan's political situation would deteriorate further, putting pressure on the currency. But some think the importance of the political situation is being overstated. ""I think the market is rather clutching at straws,"" said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank. ""It seems a little too neat to reason that if Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori is replaced he might be succeeded by a more reform-minded personality who would pursue a less expansionary fiscal policy, which would inhibit growth and therefore weaken the currency. ""Fiscal consolidation is necessary, but it can't happen without growth. It is likely to follow only once the recovery is assured."" A simpler explanation might be that yen carry trades are simply becoming more attractive because of the low volatility of the yen, in other words people can borrow cheaply in yen and invest in dollars. And this means more short-term selling of the yen. * Sterling weakened against the dollar as UK unemployment was shown to have risen for the first time in two years. The October jobless count rose by 3,500, supporting the view that UK interest rates had peaked. Headline earnings growth rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.1 per cent, but this remained below the 4.5 per cent threshold that the Bank of England deems consistent with its inflation target. Late in London the pound was trading at $1.4260 against the dollar, after a low of $1.4229. The euro peaked at #0.6040 against sterling, slipping back to around $0.6010 in late trade. * Like the euro, the ailing Australian dollar has been receiving some support from the threat of currency market intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The bank confirmed in its semi-annual statement this week that it had been in the market several times in recent weeks to reinforce what it identified as an emerging trend towards stability. The Australian dollar, which has been struggling since last week, staged a brief half-cent rally as intervention rumours hit the market, but fell close to record lows as they proved groundless. Critics of the RBA's intervention policy argue that the bank is fighting against deteriorating fundamentals. They point to signs of weakening domestic growth against a backdrop of lower global growth prospects. This would imply both reduced demand for Australian exports in the key Asian region, and negative price effects as commodity prices decline. Some argue that the impact of the intervention is limited by the fact that the RBA's foreign exchange reserves are relatively modest. The market knows that the bank's capacity to wage a prolonged or heavy intervention campaign is limited. Late in London the Australian dollar was $0.520 against the US dollar, after a low of $0.518. It fell to a record of $0.511 last month. "
235,2009-01-28,2009-01-29,Financial Times,Fed puts faith in targeted credit action,"Policy statement The Federal Reserve has grown more concerned about the outlook for the economy and the risk of deflation - and it is inclined to fight those dangers by expanding targeted credit operations rather than purchasing Treasury securities. However, Treasury purchases remain under active consideration and could be implemented quickly in -certain circumstances. Those were the key messages from yesterday's statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, which kept interest rates on hold at virtually zero. The Fed said that since its December policy meeting the economy ""has weakened -further"". In addition to a pull-back in spending by US consumers and businesses, ""global demand appears to be slowing significantly"". While the Fed expected a gradual recovery to begin ""later this year"", the risks of that not happening were ""significant"". The downgrade to the outlook implicitly extends the period for which the Fed would expect to keep interest rates near zero. Moreover, policymakers added two new references that acknowledged the risk of deflation and its close cousin: uncomfortably low inflation. ""The committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term."" With interest rates at virtually zero, the strategic choice for the Fed is whether to combat risks by expanding targeted credit operations that aim to revitalise specific markets for credit or else by buying long-term US Treasuries. Both options could bring down private borrowing costs - the first directly, by reducing risk premiums in dysfunctional markets, the second indirectly, by lowering benchmark risk-free rates. Fed officials have differing views on the relative merits of those approaches and that debate is likely to have dominated the meeting. In the end, the FOMC appears to have taken the view that targeted credit operations offer the most bang for the buck, though that assessment could change. The Fed said it would ""assess whether expansions or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets"". That looks like code for beefing up the term asset-backed securities loan facility (Talf), which provides low-cost finance for investors willing to buy consumer loans bundled up as securities, and potentially using this model to support commercial mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds as well. The US central bank also held out the possibility of extending its purchases of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, running at the rate of $300bn (€228bn, £211bn) a quarter, to keep mortgage rates low. The Fed said it was ""prepared"" to buy Treasuries ""if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets"". Some analysts saw that as hinting it would intervene if Treasury yields moved dramatically higher and pushed up private loan rates. The decision to emphasise targeted credit operations rather than Treasury purchases split the committee, with Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, voting against. The statement said he ""preferred to expand the monetary base at this time by purchasing US Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programmes"". The Fed announced no new programmes. That is not surprising, since lending decisions are formally made by the Washington-based Fed board rather than the full FOMC. In these circumstances, the FOMC sets the overall strategic direction for the Fed but may not provide the occasion for new announcements."
236,2009-01-28,2009-01-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),View of the Day: Divisions at the Fed?,"Is the Federal Reserve calling the Treasury market's bluff - or is the central bank's open market committee seeing divisions between its members? Marc Ostwald, fixed income strategist at Monument Securities, believes there is an element of brinkmanship in the FOMC's latest policy statement, in which it said it was prepared to buy Treasury bonds if it would help improve financial market conditions. ""One could conclude that they hoped that their commitment to buy Treasuries if necessary might drive down Treasury yields in so far as it is effectively a back-stop bid,"" Mr Ostwald says. But he also suggests the statement hints at divisions on the committee about the merits of buying Treasuries. ""Some on the committee may still need to be persuaded, while others may be worried about the ongoing lack of any obvious exit strategy - and, by extension, that current measures are digging an ever bigger hole from which the Fed will find it harder to extract itself from."" Mr Ostwald says the Fed will also be monitoring the progress of the rollover of the commercial paper funding facility, which will arguably offer the clearest signals on whether there has been any genuine easing in credit conditions. ""If the vast majority of the CPFF is rolled over with the Fed rather than in the open/interbank market, then this would signal that credit market strains have not really eased materially."""
237,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Markets Overview: Mixed US data damps Fed's upbeat view.,"There was slightly more worrying news on the growth front when the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index unexpectedly fell to 49.3, below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction, and its lowest since April 2003.  James Knightley at ING noted that there had now been two sub-50 readings on the ISM in the space of three months. ""The rate doves will seize on the fact that whenever we have had a sub-50 ISM reading in the past 30 years or so, the Fed has cut interest rates within around six months,"" he said.  But he added that much broader weakness in the US economy would need to be seen in order to get the Fed in the frame of mind to lower borrowing costs.  Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort, said the US central bank was now likely to be satisfied that 5.25 per cent represented funds rate neutrality. He noted that when the market harbours neutral rate expectations, the two-year Treasury bond yield hovers a few basis points above the federal funds rate. But, the yield is currently about 30 basis points below Fed  funds. ""A significant 'hope factor' is still built into the bond market's expectations, which is not warranted on the basis of the FOMC's statement,"" he said.  Treasuries initially pushed higher after the inflation and ISM data. But the rally ran out of steam following the release of strong data on pending home sales.  The dollar briefly came under pressure from the weak ISM data but recovered as investors positioned themselves for today's crucial US employment report.  Equity markets largely took the data flood in their stride. By early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.10 per cent, after earlier setting a fresh all-time high of 12,667.03. The S&P 500 was up 0.26 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.02 per cent higher.  Europe put in an even stronger performance, with heavily-weighted oil and mining stocks providing much of the impetus. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.02 per cent to a six-year high, while the FTSE 100 in London outperformed with a 1.3 per cent advance. Unusually, not a single FTSE 100 stock fell in price.  In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo climbed 0.8 per cent to a nine-month peak, Hong Kong rallied 1.6 per cent and there were record highs for Sydney and Singapore.  Oil prices retreated after two days of strong gains, with the benchmark US crude future slipping back below $58 a barrel.  European and Asian equity markets responded strongly to reassuring comments on the US economy from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, although Wall Street was more subdued as investors digested another barrage of mixed economic data.  The US central bank said the economy was ""somewhat firmer"" and that inflation readings had ""improved modestly"" as it announced its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent.  A tame reading yesterday for the December PCE core price deflator - the Fed's favoured inflation indicator - backed up the Fed's relatively optimistic view on pricing pressures.  However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital,  "

In a busy day for data, December personal income and spending rose 0.5 and 0.7 per cent respectively. The headline personal consumption expenditure index was 0.1 per cent, while the year-on-year core rate that excludes food and energy prices rose 2.20 per cent. That placed it just below the Fed's central tendency of 2.25 to 2.5 per cent for 2006.  After the opening bell, investors will receive the latest survey of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management. Economists expect a reading of 51.7 for January, up from 51.4 in December, indicating an expansion in activity.  Stocks rallied broadly on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting and noted the economy was 'somewhat firmer' and core inflation had 'improved modestly in recent months'.  Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were up 3.30 points at 1446.30, while Nasdaq futures were up 6 points at x1808.50.  Fair value for the S&P 500 is 1443 and 1802.74 for the Nasdaq.  Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 30 points at 12,690 and the Dow was poised to break the record peak of 12,657.02 is set on Wednesday.  Stocks in the spotlight included Google and Dell.  After the close on Wednesday, Google reported earnings of $3.18 a share, beating estimates of $2.92. In pre-market trade the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $44.16.  Meanwhile, Dell announced Chairman Michael Dell would return to the role of chief executive, replacing Kevin Rollins, effective immediately. The company also forecast fourth-quarter profit and sales below Wall Street expectations. The stock was 5.1 per cent higher at $25.45 in pre-market trade.  In earnings news, ExxonMobil reported fourth-quarter earnings of $10.25bn, or $1.76 a share, on revenue of $90.03bn. Excluding special items, the company earned $9.84 bn, or $1.69 a share, above the forecast of $1.51 a share. For 2006, the oil producer earned $39.5bn, beating its previous record of $36.1bn set in 2005. Shares in Exxon rose 0.9 per cent to $74.75 in pre-market trade.  Late on Wednesday, Starbucks reported net income for the fiscal first quarter was $205m, or 26 cents a share, and the results matched estimates. The stock was 1.8 per cent higher at $35.17 in pre-market trade.  Shares in JDS Uniphase were off 2 per cent at $17.42 in pre-market trade. The telecommunications equipment maker swung to a fiscal second-quarter profit of 10 cents a share, compared with a net loss last time of $42.1m, or 20 cents a share. Excluding special items, JDS earned 13 cents a share, above estimates of 11 cents a share.  Companies due with earnings on Thursday, include Raytheon and Amazon.  On Wednesday, the S&P 500 had risen 0.7 per cent to 1,438.24, after being unchanged before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended.  The Russell 2000 index of small companies closed above 800 for the first time and rose 0.5 per cent to 802.12.  "
239,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times,Broad rally in stocks as Fed signals soft landing *Interest rates kept at 5.25% on 'firmer' growth.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled growing confidence that the economy was heading for a soft landing, triggering a broad rally in the stock market.  The statement issued at the end of the Fed's January policy meeting - which kept interest rates on hold at 5.25 per cent - for the first time raised the possibility that the US housing market could be bottoming out.  At the same time, it cited progress on inflation, noting ""readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months"".  These comments suggest that the Fed is growing comfortable with the outlook for both growth and inflation.  The Fed's encouraging words came after figures showed the US economy grew at an above-trend rate of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while inflation and wage growth moderated. Consumer spending grew at a blistering rate, while growth was also supported by a surge in US exports.  Stocks and bonds rose in response to the Fed's outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record high in afternoon trading, before closing up 0.8 per cent at 12,621.69. Bond prices rallied, with 10-year yields ending the day nearly 5 basis points lower at 4.83 per cent. The dollar slipped against the euro and the yen, while interest rate futures were broadly unchanged.  The Fed acknowledged the strong economic data in its statement, noting that growth looked ""somewhat firmer"" than it did at the time of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in October.  However, the Fed hinted that its views on growth had not changed very dramatically since the October meeting.  It cited only ""tentative"" signs that housing might be stabilising and altered only slightly its description of how growth was likely to evolve this year.  The Fed said it expected the economy to expand at a ""moderate pace over coming quarters"" - the same phrase it used in October. This implies that policymakers think the pace of growth will slow from the fourth quarter to the first as the effect of lower oil prices, higher stock prices and mild weather in late 2006 fades.  Yesterday's figures showed gross domestic product rose 3.5 per cent in the last three months of 2006 after a gain of 2 per cent in the previous quarter, while the rate of increase in core prices slowed to 2.1 per cent from 2.2 per cent.  The expansion was led by a 4.4 per cent increase in personal consumption, which showed that Americans continued to spend, in spite of the slowdown in housing.  Exports were also exceptionally strong, rising 10 per cent, compared with an increase of 6.8 per cent in the third period.  Drew Mathus, an economist at Lehman Brothers, said: ""The strong growth shows us that 2006 ended with a bang. It also tells us that the first quarter is not likely to be exceptionally weak.""  "
240,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times,Treasuries regain ground.,"US Treasury bond prices strengthened yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee's statement appeared to somewhat downplay inflation fears while at the same time upgrading its assessment of the outlook for the US economy.  The Fed left overnight interest rates steady at 5.25 per cent as expected, but made changes to its statement. It said economic growth was ""somewhat firmer"", helped by ""stabilisation"" in the housing market, while readings on core inflation had ""improved modestly"". Nonetheless, the committee still sounded its familiar note of caution, saying inflation risks remain.  Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, a dissenter in recent FOMC meetings, has rotated out of voting status, and yesterday's vote was unanimous.  ""The FOMC statement has changed more materially than recent meetings but the essence of the statement is that they have upgraded the growth outlook/risks and downgraded the inflation risks,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  Bonds had already gained on the day. Data showing that US gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, above expectations, initially weighed on bonds.  But later figures showed that business activity in the US Midwest contracted in January. Chicago's purchasing managers' index had its lowest reading since April 2003.  Shortly after the release of the statement, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 3.3 basis points to 4.843 per cent, while the two-year yield was down 2.9bp at 4.946 per cent.  European government bonds largely tracked the movements in the US Treasury market after finding little direction from mixed eurozone economic data.  In late trading in London, the 10-year Bund was yielding 4.099 per cent, down 0.4bp. The yield on the two-year Schatz was down 0.3bp at 3.958 per cent.  UK gilt prices were mixed, with the yield on the 10-year gilt down 1.1bp to 4.979 per cent and the yield on the two-year up 0.2bp to 5.483 per cent.  Prices rose on Japanese government bonds on news of a fall in wage earners' cash earnings. The figures highlighted companies' reluctance to raise salaries, despite record profits. The yield on the two-year, which is highly sensitive to interest rate expectations, slipped 1.5bp to 0.725 per cent.  "

As expected the Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight borrowing rate steady at 5.25 per cent and still expressed concern over inflation in its accompanying policy statement.  The reference to stronger-than-expected data since December came after data yesterday revealed the economy grew by 3.5 per cent during the last three months of 2006, beating estimates of 3.1 per cent.  Stocks shrugged off a mixed performance, marked by weakness in technology shares, after the FOMC meeting concluded.  At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 had moved 0.4 per cent higher to 1,435.04, after being unchanged before the FOMC meeting ended.  The Nasdaq Composite rebounded from negative territory and was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,457.81.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent at 12,607.67.

The stock rose 4.6 per cent to Dollars 89.98  Bristol-Myers Squibb was up 2.5 per cent at Dollars 28.74, after the Financial Times reported that the pharmaceuticals company had appointed Lehman Brothers to work alongside Citigroup and Morgan Stanley to examine its options ahead of an expected takeover bid from Sanofi-Aventis.  Altria posted fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.40 a share, above estimates of Dollars 1.23, and said the long planned distribution of its 89 per cent stake in Kraft would take place on March 30.

The cautious mood also reflected a lower dollar amid rumours that West Germany will raise interest rates this week. In late trading, the short end of the market was unchanged to 1/32 point lower while long-dated issues were as much as 1/8 point higher. The Treasury's benchmark long bond outperformed the rest of the curve, rising 9/32 point for a yield of 8.81 per cent. After Friday's brief upward tilt in the yield curve, it has now inverted again with the yield on two-year issues at 8.89 per cent.

The recent federal bond, fixed for the first time on the stock exchanges, was priced at 100.10 to yield 6.99 per cent. The penultimate bond, due February 1999, was fixed 10 pfennigs weaker than on Friday at par yielding 7.00 per cent. * * * Interest rate concerns also beset the French market, although turnover was not high as dealers and investors drifted back from the long weekend. The June futures contract on the Matif opened 26 basis points lower at 106.34, dropping further during the day, as concerns about pressures for a German rate increase preoccupied traders. Some technical short covering helped the market to close off its lows at 106.40. * * * The UK gilt-edged securities market headed lower in listless trading ahead of major economic figures tomorrow and Friday. The issue of three non-government sterling bonds also depressed the market at the start. Despite a slightly firmer tone to sterling, opening gilts prices were up to 1/4 point weaker as traders and investors sold gilts in order to take advantage of two long-term domestic sterling issues.

244,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE.,"It was a cautious session in the equity derivatives ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, though rollover activity boosted turnover in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the overnight retreat on Wall Street set the tone for the opening of trading in the December contract on the FTSE 100 contract. It started trading at 3,975, some 14 points below its previous close. Following a period of sideways trading, buyers of the contract were seen at the lower levels. This gathered momentum, as UK PSBR data was in line with market expectations, and by late morning, December was trading at 3,996, the peak of the day. Fears of a poor opening in New York, along with some nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, saw December surrender some of its earlier gains. The publication of US housing data and the initial fall in US bonds caused a further decline, although an improvement on Wall Street saw the contract close off the day's lows. December finished at 3,972, an 8 point discount to the cash market. Volume in the December contract was 22,860 lots, while volume in March was 12,833. Turnover in traded options was 37,917 contracts, of which 12,934 was in the Footsie option and 13,559 in the European-style contract.

Number three in the German banking league, Commerzbank pushed ahead against the trend as speculation ranged from the possibility of an outright bid for the bank or a strategic acquisition by Commerzbank itself. It was an old story but it brushed up fresh enough to lift the shares by 34 pfg to DM 38.44. Some dealers said that a single big buy order explained the rise. Otherwise traders spent the session tracking Wall Street and positioning themselves ahead of Friday's options and futures expiry for Dax contracts Deutsche Bank closed off DM 1.22 at DM 71.19 and Dresdner Bank ended down 33 pfg at DM 48.83. Volkswagen lost DM 3.70 to DM 608.30. Thyssen shed DM 3 to DM 270. Rumours of management changes left SAP DM 6.90 lower at DM 202.50. At the close, the Dax index was 32.66 lower at an Ibis-indicated 2,808.50. PARIS had a volatile session, recovering strongly from early losses on the news of official rate cuts but finally ending with the CAC 40 index off 28.87 or 1.3% at 2,193.70. Dealers said that turnover was dull with investors uncertain about direction and many holding off the market as the Bank of France spelt out its monetary policy targets. The interest rate moves met with a mixed reaction, as Axa hardened slightly but most financials lost ground. Axa added FFr 2.60 to FFr 304.8. Bancaire came off FFr 13 to FFr 565 and Suez shed FFr 3.50 to FFr 211. Paribas ended down FFr 5.10 at FFr 339. LVMH dipped FFr 25 to FFr 1,243 in spite of a Japanese decision to reduce whisky sales taxes. Dealers said that worries about the group's DFS purchase held sentiment in check. Among second liners, Groupe Andre, the shoe retailer, added FFr 1.60 to FFr 398.6 after announcing a financial restructuring plan. Usinor-Sacilor, something of a high flyer lately on the back of CAC 40 inclusion hopes, came off FFr 1.30 to FFr 76. AMSTERDAM took its cue from a dull bond market and moved lower in subdued volume. The AEX index unwound most of Monday's gains, ending off 3.18 at 612.94. Fortis Amev, the previous day's best performer, turned tail with a decline of Fl 1.20 or more than 2% to DFl 56.80. ABN-Amro dipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 106.3. Forecasts of an oil price drop to $16 a barrel next year from Royal Dutch sent the shares down by 10 cents to Fl 288.40.

Baloise fell SwFr 115 to SwFr 2,760 when trading resumed after a suspension due to the insurer's announcement that it planned a share split and a capital payout, rather than a dividend, on 1996 results. Swissair added to Monday's SwFr 38 jump, with another rise of SwFr 14, taking the shares to SwFr 1,069 on expectations that tomorrow's press conference would bring news of a plan to separate some of the company's profitable catering operations from its airline operations. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.6% fall in Scania, the truck maker, after its announcement, late on Monday, that its production in the first quarter of 1997 would be cut. The shares lost SKr6 to SKr162. Scania said that it would cut production by about 15% in Europe to balance delivery delays caused by the French truckers' strike in November. The company added that the dispute hit sales and earnings which could have an adverse impact on results in the current quarter. The Affaersvaerlden general index was down 25.4 at 2,290.0. Stadshypotek eased SKr1.5 to SKr186.5 after the board decided to recommend to shareholders the acceptance of Svenska Handelsbanken's bid. Handelsbanken was SKr5 down at SKr190. ISTANBUL rebounded 3.7%, wiping out Monday's 2.4% fall which followed Standard &Poor's downgrading of the country's long-term foreign currency rating. The IMBK-100 index picked up 3,239.00 to close at a day's high of 90,395.96 on selective buying fuelled by a limited cash influx. One analyst said that the recovery came as investors realised that the S&P action did not affect other instruments and that Monday's early 5.5% plunge had been an overreaction. OSLO fell 1.4%, unnerved by the overnight fall on Wall Street and yesterday's US economic data. The total index finished 13.17 down at 920.03. Analysts noted, however, that the market was likely to see a cash inflow in coming weeks under regulations which give investors tax breaks if they invest in the stock market around new year.

246,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,FURTHER SELLING LEAVES SEOUL NEAR 45 MONTH LOW.,"Further nervous selling took SEOUL down for a fifth consecutive session and left the composite index 10.57 weaker at 663.35, at its lowest level for almost 45 months. Analysts who warned that the index could fall as low as 620 points before a floor was found, said that the uncertain economic outlook, high interest rates and a floundering currency had made the stock market an unattractive proposition for many investors, especially foreigners. They added that investors were particularly uninspired by the government's recent market boosting measures. Some buying emerged in late trading for banks and securities shares on the view that they had been oversold. Commercial Bank of Korea rose Won180 to Won5,180 and Kookmin Bank gained Won200 to Won11,300. Daewoo Securities rose Won300 to Won11,000. TOKYO finished flat after early losses were mostly offset by fresh buying and short-covering in recently hard hit sectors such as construction and banking, agencies report. The Nikkei 225 average finished 8.58 lower at 20,413.46, after a high of 20,500.90 and a low of 20,230.88. Its March futures fell 10 to 20,410. Conversely, the broader Topix index rose 3.44 to 1,515.42, prompting the view that most weak sectors had now bottomed out. The Nikkei 300 average gained 0.78 to 287.42. Volume on the first section of the TSE was a moderate 341m shares, compared with 266m shares on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 628 to 430, while 200 issues were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1444.97. Losing sectors were led by insurance, rubber, miscellaneous manufacturing, land transport and gas. Gainers were led by railway/bus, banks, oil, construction and warehousing. Shares in Japan's non-life insurers lost out for a second consecutive day. The biggest loser was Tokio Marine, down Y 50 at 1,070, while Mitsui Marine fell Y 26 to Y 608 and Yasuda Fire lost Y 23 at Y 620. Renewed foreign demand supported the banks. Daiwa Bank jumped Y 25 to Y 637 while Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y 50 to Y 1,840 Y 50 and Y 1,770 respectively. In the new, second section of the over-the-counter market, ATL Systems made a solid debut. The shares, with a subscription price of Y 280,000, climbed to a high of Y 473,000 before turning back to close at Y 424,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.21 to 20,692,57. SHENZHEN's Aand B shares, targeted respectively at domestic and foreign investors, continued to plunge, closing near their limit-down levels of 10% in further response to Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets. The A index plummeted 41.69 to 375.51 and the B index dived 12.79 to 121.64. SHANGHAI's A shares were also under pressure, losing 100.964 or 9.6% to 946.716, but the B index found some relief after its recent falls, losing 1.431 or 2.4% at 58.498. HONG KONG was weak with yesterday's US Federal Open Market Committee providing an excuse to take profits. The Hang Seng index fell 122.11 to 12,815.37 after bouncing off a low of 12,747.91. Turnover declined but remained healthy at HK$5.7bn, down from Monday's HK$6.5bn. Properties came in for selling in the morning, but utilities were the worst performersover the day. Hongkong Telecom slipped 30 cents to HK$12.90 and China Light lost 50 cents to HK$33.50, while Hongkong Electric added 5 cents to HK$25.75. TAIPEI ended lower after late selling in thin volume. The weighted index gave up early to close off 35.85 at 6,855.57. First International Computer stayed on the upside, adding T$1 or 1.94% to T$52.5 after raising its profit target for this year by around 30%. MANILA finished lower with the main index slipping 22.37 to 3,093.21. Bargain hunting created two bright spots. Centennial City, hit lately by the Manila Bay reclamation controversy, bounced 50 centavos or 18% to 3.10 pesos. Philipino Telephone gained 1.25 pesos or almost 5% to 24 pesos. BANGKOK eased lower as investors put a negative interpretation on the latest economic plan. The SET index slipped 5.53 to 867.23 on weak volume. SYDNEY moved lower in line with the overnight decline on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index came off 20.5 to 2,315.8. Media stocks provided the main focus on the news that Hollinger is to sell its 25% holding in Fairfax to Brierley Investments. Fairfax dipped 1 cent to A$2.77. SINGAPORE featured a 2.8% drop in Fraser &Neave in further response to its warning that it expected its property earnings to fall by half in the current year. The shares lost 40 cents to S$14.10, at which level, analysts said, F&N should find some support. The broad market was easier with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 6.74 at 2,176.52. Strong demand was, however, seen for Singapore Land which rose 35 cents to S$8.20. Jurong Cement was another gainer, rising 5 cents to S$6.25 on old takeover rumours.

247,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,DOLLAR DIPS ON STRONG US HOUSING STARTS DATA.,"The dollar lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, after robust US housing starts data caused a sell-off in US bonds and persuaded traders that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to slow the American economy. The D-Mark closed 0.9 pfennigs higher against the dollar in London yesterday at DM 1.545. The German currency was also buoyed by Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, who told the Financial Times that the stability pact for European monetary union must be implemented strictly. That would stop Emu member states from running loose fiscal policies, and would thus help make the future single European currency a hard one. Mr Kit Juckes, currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said Mr Issing's comments showed the Bundesbank was more hawkish than the German government in seeking strict conditions for Emu. Sterling rose against both the dollar and the D-Mark, buoyed by continued belief that the UK would raise interest rates soon but that at the same time inflation was under control. Japanese investors continued buying the pound. It rose 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.673 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.585. However these changes came amid thin trading as the quiet fortnight on the currency markets continued. Mr Mark Geddes, analyst at 4Cast, said: ""We're into pre-Christmas trading at the moment."" Traders were also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Markets Committee meeting after the London close. The FOMC left interest rates unchanged. Both France and Sweden cut key rates. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and its 5-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60%. But the French franc barely softened against the D-Mark, and rose against the dollar. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, reduced its repo rate for the 25th time this year, by 25 basis points to 4.1%. The market had expected the move, and the krona fell only slightly against the D-Mark, from SKr4.396 to SKr4.414. The Riksbank also said Sweden's inflation outlook had improved since its September report. The bank now expects inflation rates of 1.5% in 1997 and two per cent in 1998. * French and German policymakers yesterday again pointed in different directions regarding the level of the dollar. The Bundesbank's monthly report said the D-Mark had now almost wholly corrected its excessive strength of last year, so that its level was in line with economic fundamentals. The report also suggested interest rates would not move for a while. The message seemed to be that the Bundesbank rejected French demands for a rate cut aimed at boosting the dollar. France thinks a fall in the franc would stimulate its economy. But it can only make very minor cuts to its own rates - as it did yesterday - unless the Bundesbank eases too. Otherwise the franc would cease tracking the D-Mark, and the Emu process could collapse. But although the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to exclude the option of a weaker D-Mark and French franc, Mr Jean Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, simultaneously called for exactly that. ""It is possible that the market has a tendency to underestimate the underlying fundamentals of the dollar,"" he said, suggesting that the US currency was undervalued. He said the Group of Seven industrialised nations should discuss the issue. But France would not appear to have the Bundesbank's backing. * There was more support yesterday for the view that most Japanese officials want the dollar weaker than Y 114 to the yen. That support came after Mr Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's management and co-ordination agency, said to general surprise that the yen should be ""slightly cheaper"" than its present level to help Japanese industry. His comment sent the dollar above Y 114. But other unnamed Japanese officials later said Mr Muto had been speaking on a personal basis, and the dollar lost Y 0.3 on the day to close at Y 113.7.

248,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,SIGNS OF HOUSING STRENGTH HIT TREASURIES.,"Signs of stronger growth in the US housing sector pushed down bond prices in New York and dampened sentiment in most other markets, as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. In Europe, prices drifted lower in thin trading with many bigger traders such as hedge funds and bank proprietary desks reported to be on the sidelines. The US housing figures led to a fall in prices in early trading with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rising to its highest level since November 4. At mid-afternoon in New York, the long bond was off 13/32 at 97 29/32 to yield 6.657%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note fell 1/16 to 99 19/32 yielding 5.830%. The March 30-year bond fell by 7/16 to 112 5/16. Treasuries started the morning with modest losses and then slipped further after the Commerce Department said that construction was begun on 1.5m homes in November, a 9.2% increase that made up for nearly all of the decline in housing starts seen in September and October. Economists had expected the figure to have held steady at about 1.39m homes. The Fed announced that it had concluded its Open Market Committee meeting without changing interest rates. Few on Wall Street had expected any change in monetary policy, but economists are divided about whether the Fed might raise interest rates in the early part of next year. FOMC members did not issue any statement. Mr John Spinello, a government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch said there was no increase in activity after the Fed's announcement. He attributed much of yesterday's declines to a desire among portfolio managers to lock in gains, especially given the market's strength in November. ""There is some skittishness about lower [bond] prices eating into the returns of managers,"" he said. Concerns about new supply set to hit the market today and tomorrow, when the Treasury is to auction two-year and five-year notes, may also have contributed to yesterday's slide. In Europe, The Italian market started well with early buying in the cash market by domestic institutions. At Liffe, the London futures market, the March BTP contract reached a high in mid-morning of 129.13. Analysts said that investors had been encouraged by the fact that the government had overcome some parliamentary opposition to its 1997 budget plans. Further votes on the package are due to take place this week. Even so, following the decline in the US, prices drifted lower later in the day with the BTP contract settling at 128.29, down more than half a point. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread over Germany, which had narrowed to a low of 165 basis points by mid-morning, later widened back out to close 5 basis points wider at 172 basis points. The Spanish market followed a similar pattern with the March 10-year futures contract settling at 110.91, down 0.70, and the yield spread over Germany widening by 5 basis points to 117. Among the ""peripheral"" markets, however, Sweden bucked the trend, with the local market buoyed by a further cut in the repo rate by the Riksbank. Sweden's 10-year yield spread over Germany fell by 8 basis points to 94. Denmark also outperformed, with its 10-year spread narrowing from 84 to 81 basis points. France and Germany both lost about a third of a point. The markets found little encouragement from the Bank of France's decision to reduce its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and also its five to 10-day repo rate, which usually set the ceiling for market rates, by 15 basis points to 4.60%. ""The markets were putting a negative spin on everything,"" said Mr Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. The poor performance of the US market also dragged down UK government bonds, with the March long gilt contract falling by 3/8, to 108 11/16. Japanese government bonds were also knocked back by the fall in the US, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB No 182 rising in London trading by about one basis point to 2.41%. Earlier in the day in Tokyo, the yield on the JGB had fallen by 3 basis points, with bonds benefiting from a fall in the local equity market. Mr Alex Cooper, manager at Tullett &Tokyo, said traders were watching Japanese yields particularly closely following the fall of yields to historic low levels earlier this month. ""A downtrend in the JGB market could be a catalyst for a nasty sell-off in international bond markets,"" argues Mr Cooper. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved.

252,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE.,"It was a cautious session in the equity derivatives ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, though rollover activity boosted turnover in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the overnight retreat on Wall Street set the tone for the opening of trading in the December contract on the FTSE 100 contract. It started trading at 3,975, some 14 points below its previous close. Following a period of sideways trading, buyers of the contract were seen at the lower levels. This gathered momentum, as UK PSBR data was in line with market expectations, and by late morning, December was trading at 3,996, the peak of the day. Fears of a poor opening in New York, along with some nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, saw December surrender some of its earlier gains. The publication of US housing data and the initial fall in US bonds caused a further decline, although an improvement on Wall Street saw the contract close off the day's lows. December finished at 3,972, an 8 point discount to the cash market. Volume in the December contract was 22,860 lots, while volume in March was 12,833. Turnover in traded options was 37,917 contracts, of which 12,934 was in the Footsie option and 13,559 in the European-style contract. Railtrack was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,113 lots. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
253,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,TAKEOVER TALK LIFTS FRANKFURT FROM TROUGH.,"A revival of takeover talk at Commerzbank lifted FRANKFURT comfortably off its worst levels of the day. Number three in the German banking league, Commerzbank pushed ahead against the trend as speculation ranged from the possibility of an outright bid for the bank or a strategic acquisition by Commerzbank itself. It was an old story but it brushed up fresh enough to lift the shares by 34 pfg to DM 38.44. Some dealers said that a single big buy order explained the rise. Otherwise traders spent the session tracking Wall Street and positioning themselves ahead of Friday's options and futures expiry for Dax contracts Deutsche Bank closed off DM 1.22 at DM 71.19 and Dresdner Bank ended down 33 pfg at DM 48.83. Volkswagen lost DM 3.70 to DM 608.30. Thyssen shed DM 3 to DM 270. Rumours of management changes left SAP DM 6.90 lower at DM 202.50. At the close, the Dax index was 32.66 lower at an Ibis-indicated 2,808.50. PARIS had a volatile session, recovering strongly from early losses on the news of official rate cuts but finally ending with the CAC 40 index off 28.87 or 1.3% at 2,193.70. Dealers said that turnover was dull with investors uncertain about direction and many holding off the market as the Bank of France spelt out its monetary policy targets. The interest rate moves met with a mixed reaction, as Axa hardened slightly but most financials lost ground. Axa added FFr 2.60 to FFr 304.8. Bancaire came off FFr 13 to FFr 565 and Suez shed FFr 3.50 to FFr 211. Paribas ended down FFr 5.10 at FFr 339. LVMH dipped FFr 25 to FFr 1,243 in spite of a Japanese decision to reduce whisky sales taxes. Dealers said that worries about the group's DFS purchase held sentiment in check. Among second liners, Groupe Andre, the shoe retailer, added FFr 1.60 to FFr 398.6 after announcing a financial restructuring plan. Usinor-Sacilor, something of a high flyer lately on the back of CAC 40 inclusion hopes, came off FFr 1.30 to FFr 76. AMSTERDAM took its cue from a dull bond market and moved lower in subdued volume. The AEX index unwound most of Monday's gains, ending off 3.18 at 612.94. Fortis Amev, the previous day's best performer, turned tail with a decline of Fl 1.20 or more than 2% to DFl 56.80. ABN-Amro dipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 106.3. Forecasts of an oil price drop to $16 a barrel next year from Royal Dutch sent the shares down by 10 cents to Fl 288.40. News of fare hikes at both the airline and its cargo offshoot depressed KLM by 10 cents to Fl 47.10. Philips came off 10 cents to Fl 68. KNP BT was the day's sharpest decline, tumbling Fl 1.70 or 4.6% to Fl 35.30. ZURICH put Ciba and Sandoz in the spotlight as the companies called a news conference about their planned merger to become Novartis. However, the pair turned back from their best levels after they confirmed that the US Federal Trade Commission had conditionally approved the merger. The two companiesinsisted that the conditions left their innovative potential intact. Ciba finished SwFr 2 weaker at SwFr 1,625, off a high of SwFr 1,649, while Sandoz turned back from SwFr 1,540 to finish SwFr 4 weaker at SwFr 1,525. The new Novartis shares are to begin trading on December 23. The broad market edged lower, with many investors sidelined ahead of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index lost 19.8 to 3,850.4. Baloise fell SwFr 115 to SwFr 2,760 when trading resumed after a suspension due to the insurer's announcement that it planned a share split and a capital payout, rather than a dividend, on 1996 results. Swissair added to Monday's SwFr 38 jump, with another rise of SwFr 14, taking the shares to SwFr 1,069 on expectations that tomorrow's press conference would bring news of a plan to separate some of the company's profitable catering operations from its airline operations. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.6% fall in Scania, the truck maker, after its announcement, late on Monday, that its production in the first quarter of 1997 would be cut. The shares lost SKr6 to SKr162. Scania said that it would cut production by about 15% in Europe to balance delivery delays caused by the French truckers' strike in November. The company added that the dispute hit sales and earnings which could have an adverse impact on results in the current quarter. The Affaersvaerlden general index was down 25.4 at 2,290.0. Stadshypotek eased SKr1.5 to SKr186.5 after the board decided to recommend to shareholders the acceptance of Svenska Handelsbanken's bid. Handelsbanken was SKr5 down at SKr190. ISTANBUL rebounded 3.7%, wiping out Monday's 2.4% fall which followed Standard &Poor's downgrading of the country's long-term foreign currency rating. The IMBK-100 index picked up 3,239.00 to close at a day's high of 90,395.96 on selective buying fuelled by a limited cash influx. One analyst said that the recovery came as investors realised that the S&P action did not affect other instruments and that Monday's early 5.5% plunge had been an overreaction. OSLO fell 1.4%, unnerved by the overnight fall on Wall Street and yesterday's US economic data. The total index finished 13.17 down at 920.03. Analysts noted, however, that the market was likely to see a cash inflow in coming weeks under regulations which give investors tax breaks if they invest in the stock market around new year. BRUSSELS ended lower with a big fall for the Bekaert wire rope group unsettling sentiment. Bekaert lost BFr 3,075 to BFr 19,825 following a profits warning. The BFX index closed 111.16 lower at 1,849.03. Written and edited by Michael Morgan and Jeffrey Brown Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

254,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,FURTHER SELLING LEAVES SEOUL NEAR 45 MONTH LOW.,"Further nervous selling took SEOUL down for a fifth consecutive session and left the composite index 10.57 weaker at 663.35, at its lowest level for almost 45 months. Analysts who warned that the index could fall as low as 620 points before a floor was found, said that the uncertain economic outlook, high interest rates and a floundering currency had made the stock market an unattractive proposition for many investors, especially foreigners. They added that investors were particularly uninspired by the government's recent market boosting measures. Some buying emerged in late trading for banks and securities shares on the view that they had been oversold. Commercial Bank of Korea rose Won180 to Won5,180 and Kookmin Bank gained Won200 to Won11,300. Daewoo Securities rose Won300 to Won11,000. TOKYO finished flat after early losses were mostly offset by fresh buying and short-covering in recently hard hit sectors such as construction and banking, agencies report. The Nikkei 225 average finished 8.58 lower at 20,413.46, after a high of 20,500.90 and a low of 20,230.88. Its March futures fell 10 to 20,410. Conversely, the broader Topix index rose 3.44 to 1,515.42, prompting the view that most weak sectors had now bottomed out. The Nikkei 300 average gained 0.78 to 287.42. Volume on the first section of the TSE was a moderate 341m shares, compared with 266m shares on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 628 to 430, while 200 issues were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1444.97. Losing sectors were led by insurance, rubber, miscellaneous manufacturing, land transport and gas. Gainers were led by railway/bus, banks, oil, construction and warehousing. Shares in Japan's non-life insurers lost out for a second consecutive day. The biggest loser was Tokio Marine, down Y 50 at 1,070, while Mitsui Marine fell Y 26 to Y 608 and Yasuda Fire lost Y 23 at Y 620. Renewed foreign demand supported the banks. Daiwa Bank jumped Y 25 to Y 637 while Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y 50 to Y 1,840 Y 50 and Y 1,770 respectively. In the new, second section of the over-the-counter market, ATL Systems made a solid debut. The shares, with a subscription price of Y 280,000, climbed to a high of Y 473,000 before turning back to close at Y 424,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.21 to 20,692,57. SHENZHEN's Aand B shares, targeted respectively at domestic and foreign investors, continued to plunge, closing near their limit-down levels of 10% in further response to Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets. The A index plummeted 41.69 to 375.51 and the B index dived 12.79 to 121.64. SHANGHAI's A shares were also under pressure, losing 100.964 or 9.6% to 946.716, but the B index found some relief after its recent falls, losing 1.431 or 2.4% at 58.498. HONG KONG was weak with yesterday's US Federal Open Market Committee providing an excuse to take profits. The Hang Seng index fell 122.11 to 12,815.37 after bouncing off a low of 12,747.91. Turnover declined but remained healthy at HK$5.7bn, down from Monday's HK$6.5bn. Properties came in for selling in the morning, but utilities were the worst performersover the day. Hongkong Telecom slipped 30 cents to HK$12.90 and China Light lost 50 cents to HK$33.50, while Hongkong Electric added 5 cents to HK$25.75. TAIPEI ended lower after late selling in thin volume. The weighted index gave up early to close off 35.85 at 6,855.57. First International Computer stayed on the upside, adding T$1 or 1.94% to T$52.5 after raising its profit target for this year by around 30%. MANILA finished lower with the main index slipping 22.37 to 3,093.21. Bargain hunting created two bright spots. Centennial City, hit lately by the Manila Bay reclamation controversy, bounced 50 centavos or 18% to 3.10 pesos. Philipino Telephone gained 1.25 pesos or almost 5% to 24 pesos. BANGKOK eased lower as investors put a negative interpretation on the latest economic plan. The SET index slipped 5.53 to 867.23 on weak volume. SYDNEY moved lower in line with the overnight decline on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index came off 20.5 to 2,315.8. Media stocks provided the main focus on the news that Hollinger is to sell its 25% holding in Fairfax to Brierley Investments. Fairfax dipped 1 cent to A$2.77. SINGAPORE featured a 2.8% drop in Fraser &Neave in further response to its warning that it expected its property earnings to fall by half in the current year. The shares lost 40 cents to S$14.10, at which level, analysts said, F&N should find some support. The broad market was easier with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 6.74 at 2,176.52. Strong demand was, however, seen for Singapore Land which rose 35 cents to S$8.20. Jurong Cement was another gainer, rising 5 cents to S$6.25 on old takeover rumours.

255,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,DOLLAR DIPS ON STRONG US HOUSING STARTS DATA.,"The dollar lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, after robust US housing starts data caused a sell-off in US bonds and persuaded traders that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to slow the American economy. The D-Mark closed 0.9 pfennigs higher against the dollar in London yesterday at DM 1.545. The German currency was also buoyed by Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, who told the Financial Times that the stability pact for European monetary union must be implemented strictly. That would stop Emu member states from running loose fiscal policies, and would thus help make the future single European currency a hard one. Mr Kit Juckes, currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said Mr Issing's comments showed the Bundesbank was more hawkish than the German government in seeking strict conditions for Emu. Sterling rose against both the dollar and the D-Mark, buoyed by continued belief that the UK would raise interest rates soon but that at the same time inflation was under control. Japanese investors continued buying the pound. It rose 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.673 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.585. However these changes came amid thin trading as the quiet fortnight on the currency markets continued. Mr Mark Geddes, analyst at 4Cast, said: ""We're into pre-Christmas trading at the moment."" Traders were also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Markets Committee meeting after the London close. The FOMC left interest rates unchanged. Both France and Sweden cut key rates. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and its 5-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60%. But the French franc barely softened against the D-Mark, and rose against the dollar. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, reduced its repo rate for the 25th time this year, by 25 basis points to 4.1%. The market had expected the move, and the krona fell only slightly against the D-Mark, from SKr4.396 to SKr4.414. The Riksbank also said Sweden's inflation outlook had improved since its September report. The bank now expects inflation rates of 1.5% in 1997 and two per cent in 1998. * French and German policymakers yesterday again pointed in different directions regarding the level of the dollar. The Bundesbank's monthly report said the D-Mark had now almost wholly corrected its excessive strength of last year, so that its level was in line with economic fundamentals. The report also suggested interest rates would not move for a while. The message seemed to be that the Bundesbank rejected French demands for a rate cut aimed at boosting the dollar. France thinks a fall in the franc would stimulate its economy. But it can only make very minor cuts to its own rates - as it did yesterday - unless the Bundesbank eases too. Otherwise the franc would cease tracking the D-Mark, and the Emu process could collapse. But although the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to exclude the option of a weaker D-Mark and French franc, Mr Jean Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, simultaneously called for exactly that. ""It is possible that the market has a tendency to underestimate the underlying fundamentals of the dollar,"" he said, suggesting that the US currency was undervalued. He said the Group of Seven industrialised nations should discuss the issue. But France would not appear to have the Bundesbank's backing. * There was more support yesterday for the view that most Japanese officials want the dollar weaker than Y 114 to the yen. That support came after Mr Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's management and co-ordination agency, said to general surprise that the yen should be ""slightly cheaper"" than its present level to help Japanese industry. His comment sent the dollar above Y 114. But other unnamed Japanese officials later said Mr Muto had been speaking on a personal basis, and the dollar lost Y 0.3 on the day to close at Y 113.7.

256,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - SHARES GIVE GROUND AGAIN ON CURRENCY WORRIES - MARKET REPORT.,"Nervousness regarding progress at the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting increased yesterday and UK shares turned down smartly in mid-afternoon. Trading volume remained light, however, and equities closed above the day's lows. The second half of the session was dominated by the dollar and the US Federal bond markets, both of which turned lower as New York absorbed strongly worded comments from the German economics minister. Markets grew fearful that the Federal Reserve might either take no action on rates or lift them by 1/2 percentage point. Either course would threaten problems for currency and bond markets. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 down at 2,946.7. Around 4 points of the Footsie fall reflected the heavy setback in GEC, which was among the most actively traded shares after severely disappointing City analysts with virtually unchanged profits. A market now looking for growth of around 6% overall in UK corporate earnings this year is no longer prepared to be forgiving of slow progress, even when accompanied by a cash mountain, as is the case with GEC. The reaction to GEC's figures helped to upset equities in early trading. However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3% in May, and industrial output by 0.1%, was favourably received, as was the UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be the house responsible. Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59% of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only #968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
257,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW'S STRENGTH MASKS BROAD MARKET DECLINE.,"Wall Street Blue chip issues posted solid gains yesterday, but otherwise US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in light trading after the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting ended with no hint of any change in monetary policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.02 at 3,674.50. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard and Poors 500 ended 0.24 off at 446.13, the American SE composite eased 0.15 to 423.55 and the Nasdaq composite was 2.59 weaker at 701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a moderate 236.2m shares. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. There was little subsequent reaction when the meeting ended during the afternoon with no announcement from the Fed, which was taken by analysts as a sign that monetary policy had not been changed. While much of the market languished, the one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed other indices thanks to strength in a few cyclical stocks, including International Paper, which closed $1 3/4 ahead at $68 3/4, Alcoa, up $1 at $76 7/8, and Caterpillar, climbing $2 3/4 to $104 1/2. Texaco advanced $1 5/8 to $62 1/2 as investors bought more stock following Tuesday's announcement of a major restructuring by the oil group aimed at cutting costs. The share price was given an additional lift yesterday by rat-ings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Dime Bancorp was one of the most active stocks on the NYSE, dropping $1 3/8 to $9 1/4 in volume of 3.2m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a $1.2bn stock swap. The news also failed to lift Anchor shares, which ended $3/8 cheaper at $15 1/2. Salomon fell $2 to $45 1/2 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of $200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks: Morgan Stanley softened $1/4 to $55 5/8, PaineWebber $1/4 to $15 1/2 and Dean Witter Discover $3/8 to $37. Canada Toronto closed modestly lower in light trading after the falling gold bullion price again pushed gold shares downward. The TSE 300 composite index lost 10.2 at 4,043.4 and declines led rises by 409 to 311 after volume of 42.8m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, with the golds group weakening 1.5% as the price of gold in New York dipped $2.10 an ounce to $383.85. The transportation group gained 1.4%. Laidlaw 'B' rose C$1/4 to C$9 5/8 in anticipation of its third-quarter financial results, expected to be released soon. Brazil Sao Paulo rose 5.3% in local currency terms in strong volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index ended 1,892 higher at 37,535 and turnover was about RDollars 221.5m ($242.1m). Traders saw local and foreign investors coming back into the market and said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69% between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.

258,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - AILING DOLLAR DRIVEN LOWER.,"The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.5685 from DM 1.5826. Against the yen the dollar ended above the session's low of Y 97.70 in London at Y 98.125, down from Y 98.825. In New York, however, it rallied to finish at DM 1.5778 and Y 98.90. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, Belgian franc and Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African President Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed that a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the US currency down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates, and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off the session's lows as analysts suggested that the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate pol-icies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated that the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of interven-tion on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he added. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefiting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget def-icits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium. The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast. The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1,000 against the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc finished in London at BFr 20.67 from BFr 20.63. Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM 2.00. Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/Amro, said sterling performed poorly against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May after 1.6% in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily steady industrial recovery. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided #217m liquidity at established rates after forecasting a shortage of #850m. The Bank gave late assistance of #590m. The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow government policy'. The rand finished in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845. The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
259,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES SLIP AS FOMC LEAVES POLICY UNCHANGED.,"Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped lower in light trading yesterday as traders and investors remained on the sidelines following the conclusion of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at to 84 3/16, yielding 7.600%. However, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 99 13/16, to yield 6.084%. Prices at the long end declined from the start in the wake of a modest weakening in the dollar during early trading. The dollar fell because the perception on Wall Street overnight was that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Analysts said the Fed realised it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators, who have been selling the dollar, to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Once the meeting ended without an announcement, it was judged the FOMC had decided to leave policy unchanged, at least until more is known about the state of the economy. The next set of important data is due tomorrow when the June employment report is published. Traders said nervousness ahead of the jobs figures explained why longer-dated prices were stuck in negative territory and trading remained subdued. European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing the FOMC meeting and currency volatility. German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on short-covering in the futures market. Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples. Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93% and the downward revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4%, from a provisional 13.7%. Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5% discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4% to 6%. UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors eyed the FOMC meeting. Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform Germany. French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of today's auction of FFr 19bn-FFr 21bn in medium-and long-dated bonds. Weakness in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move today. Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year. After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected, many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday. 'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73%, a rise of 20 basis points from Tuesday. Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher. The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11%. In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's government, and recent nervousness over the budget outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.

However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3% in May, and industrial output by 0.1%, was favourably received, as was the UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be the house responsible. Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mmark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59% of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only #968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
261,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW'S STRENGTH MASKS BROAD MARKET DECLINE.,"Wall Street Apart from gains in a few blue chip issues, US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in directionless trading yesterday morning as the market's attention remained fixed on the dollar and the second day of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By 1 pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.13 at 3,670.61. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard and Poors 500, for example, was down 0.12 at 446.25, while the American SE composite eased 0.31 to 423.39 and the Nasdaq composite declined 2.06 to 701.53. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 135m shares by 1 pm. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. A modest weakening in the dollar during the morning, and a slight decline in bond prices which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue back above 7.6%, also contributed to the mostly downbeat session. The one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed the rest of the market thanks to strength in a few stocks, most notably Texaco, which rose a further $1 3/8 to $62 1/4. Investors have been buying the stock since the company announced a major restructuring on Tuesday aimed at cutting costs, and the share price was given an additional lift yesterday by ratings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Another Dow constituent on the rise was Caterpillar, which climbed $2 5/8 to $104 3/8. There was no specific piece of news behind the rise, although it may have been sparked by hopes that the long running industrial dispute between the company and unions may be nearing a resolution. Dime Bancorp was the most active stock on the NYSE, falling $1 1/8 to $9 1/2 in volume of 2.5m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a $1.2bn stock swap. The news, however, lifted Anchor shares $1/16 to $16. Salomon dropped $1 7/8 to $45 5/8 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of $200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks, including Merrill Lynch, which eased $1/8 to $35, and Morgan Stanley, $1/2 down at $55 3/8. Canada Toronto eased in sluggish early trade on soft gold shares and weaker conglomerates. The TSE 300 composite index had declined 17.19 to 4,036.37 by midsession in 18.94m shares valued at C$231m. Precious metals showed the worst decline, losing 200.43, or 2.1%, at 9,168.17 as bullion slipped on the New York Comex market. Active issues included Nova Corp, up C$3/8 at C$11 1/8 in 2m shares dealt, and Methanex Corp, which continued its upward march with a rise of C$5/8 to C$18 in 921,744 traded. Brazil Sao Paulo advanced 5.6% in local currency terms in low mid-morning volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index rose 1,990 to 37,633. Traders said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69% between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.

262,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - LATE RISE IN YEN LEAVES NIKKEI LOSING GROUND.,"Tokyo A late rise in the yen triggered arbitrage selling and profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 205.34 at 20,629.03 after a high for the day of 20,878.78 in the morning, and a low of 20,627.43 just before the close. The yen returned to above Y 98 to the dollar, prompting profit-taking in the high-technology sector and depressing the futures market. Volume amounted to 368m shares, against 391m. Small-lot buying by foreigners and institutional investors failed to counter selling by arbitrageurs and dealers. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 12.84 to 1,670.65, while the Nikkei 300 declined 2.85 to 303.43 and falls led rises by 701 to 330, with 160 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.07 firmer at 1,352.80. Dealers predicted that equities would trade in a narrow range throughout this week, ahead of the Naples Group of Seven summit tomorrow. A Japanese broker noted large-lot buying orders around the Nikkei 20,500 mark, but more investors waiting to sell around 21,000. Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y 40 to Y 1,890 and Bank of Tokyo by Y 40 to Y 1,560. High-technology issues, which had recovered earlier this week on the brief retreat of the yen against the dollar, were sold. Hitachi, Y 1,070, and Fujitsu, Y 1,110, slipped Y 30 apiece. Terumo, the medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y 200 for the second consecutive day to Y 1,220 on continued bullishness among investors over the company's development of a new three dimensional television screen. Speculative investors continued to buy stocks seemingly linked to the 'hot weather' theme. Traders explained that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, put on Y 6 at Y 817 due to its popular air conditioner, while Mitsubishi Shindoh, an air conditioner parts maker, gained Y 8 at Y 724. Shikoku Chemicals, a pool disinfectant producer, climbed Y 40 to Y 625. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.07 to 23,252.30 in volume of 41m shares. Roundup Uncertainty about the direction of world and domestic interest rates left most of the Pacific Rim region lower. HONG KONG worried about the weak dollar and the impending end of the US FOMC meeting later yesterday, and a late afternoon sell-off left the Hang Seng index down by 168.27, or 1.95%, at 8,454.92, just off the day's low of 8,449.36. Turnover remained below HKDollars 2bn, registering a preliminary HKDollars 1.84bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 1.60bn. Brokers said investors were betting on higher interest rates in the short term. Meanwhile, worries about the profits of property developers, the focus of the late sell-off, also dogged the bourse. Cheung Kong weakened HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 31.80 and SHK Properties HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 42.20. SYDNEY surrendered recent gains to sink below the 2,000 barrier on the All Ordinaries index, which finished 12.2 points weaker at 1,991.2 and well below an intraday high of 2,010.5. Turnover was nearly A$353m. Trade was marked by Western Mining's announcement of an A$7.5bn alumina merger with Aluminum Co of America and an A$720m rights issue to fund its side of the deal. The stock dipped 50 cents, or 6.7%, to a two-month low of A$7.02. WELLINGTON fell on sell orders just before the close, the NZSE 40 index shedding 13.19 to 1,984.14. SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index fell 7.01 to 953.48. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 25.07, or 1.15%, to 2,162.88. Brokers said the sliding US dollar in recent weeks had prompted institutions to sell their Singapore investments as a hedge. KARACHI tried to rise on new account buying early in the day, but institutions and investors took to the sidelines, and attendance at the exchange was poor as rains disrupted communications and power supplies. The exchange closed an hour early, and the KSE 100 index lost 3.32 at 2,296.27 in thin volume. TAIPEI, the exception, concentrated on domestic issues, brokers hoping that the central bank may maintain its loose monetary policy after Tuesday's announcement of June inflation at 2.14%, and the weighted index gained 50.23 at 6,115.18.

263,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR AILING.,"The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed the Federal Reserve Board would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about a pfennig and a half against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.5685 from DM 1.5826. Against the yen, the dollar closed above session lows of Y 97.70 in London at Y 98.125 from Y 98.825. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, the Belgian franc and the Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African president Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the dollar down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system, it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off its session lows as analysts suggested the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate policies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of intervention on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he said. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefitting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget deficits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium. The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast. The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1000 against the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc closed in London at BFr 20.67 from BFr 20.63 against the D-Mark. Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM 2.00. Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/AMRO, said sterling performed poorly against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May after 1.6% in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily steady industrial recovery. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided #217bn at established rates after forecasting a shortage of #850m. The bank provided late assistance of #590m. The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow government policy'. The rand closed in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845. The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
264,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES SLIP AS TRADERS AWAIT FOMC DECISION.,"Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped in light volume yesterday morning as traders and investors stayed mostly on the sidelines while the Federal Reserve's open market committee finished its two-day meeting. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 9/32 at 84 3/32, yielding 7.610%. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/4, to yield 6.118%. The early decline in prices was attributed to the modest weakening in the dollar during morning trading due to the growing perception on Wall Street yesterday that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Most analysts believe that the Fed realises it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators who have been selling the dollar to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Those same analysts believe the FOMC would only raise interest rates if awaited economic statistics indicated the economy needed cooling further. The next set of important data is due out tomorrow when the June employment report is published, and nervousness ahead of the release of the jobs figures was partly to blame for yesterday's early losses and the overall lack of trading activity. European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing the FOMC meeting and continuing currency volatility. German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on the back of short-covering in the futures market. Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples. Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93% and the downward revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4%, from a provisional 13.7%. Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5% discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4% to 6%. UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors eyed the FOMC meeting. Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform Germany. French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of today's auction of FFr 19bn-FFr 21bn in medium-and long-dated bonds. Weakness in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move today. Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year. After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected, many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday. 'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73%, a rise of 20 basis points from Tuesday. Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher. The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11%. In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition government, in addition to recent nervousness over the budget outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.

265,2003-03-18,2003-03-19,Financial Times,Intractorable - OBSERVER.,"A disgruntled tobacco farmer from North Carolina has become the first, dramatic test of the Treasury department's plans to protect the financial markets during war with Iraq. Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting yesterday, a tense stand-off in front of the Fed building developed between a farmer who claimed his tractor - stuck in the National Mall's reflecting pool - was packed with explosives, and the FBI, the secret service, the US park police, and Washington police and firefighters. Streets around the reflecting pool were closed, and non-essential staff in the area's many federal buildings - including the Fed - were evacuated. Luckily, the Fed said the FOMC meeting would go ahead as planned. After all, the Treasury has just pledged to assist in co-ordinating the response of state and local authorities with critical financial institutions. Perhaps someone should call a tow truck.

266,2003-03-18,2003-03-19,Financial Times,Uncertainty prompts Fed to hold rates US ECONOMY MARKETS MORE CONFIDENT BUT CENTRAL BANK SAYS ...,"Uncertainty prompts Fed to hold rates US ECONOMY MARKETS MORE CONFIDENT BUT CENTRAL BANK SAYS GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS MAKE ASSESSMENT OF SITUATION DIFFIC. The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold at 1.25 per cent yesterday, but warned about the huge uncertainty surrounding the US economy. The decision, ahead of an imminent war with Iraq, had been predicted by most economists and priced in by investors. But despite a more confident tone in oil and financial markets in recent days, the Fed's open markets committee (FOMC) said that geo-political risks were making any assessment of the US economy very difficult. In a statement released with the decision, which was unanimous, the Fed indicated it was standing ready to cut rates immediately if the economic outlook deteriorated suddenly. The Fed said it would practise ""heightened surveillance"" of the economy - similar to language used in the past ahead of an interest rate move between scheduled meet-ings. In a highly unusual move, the Fed also said it could not tell whether the risks to the economy were balanced or weighted one way or another, citing ""unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking"". The FOMC's next scheduled meeting is on May 6. Gloomy data released in recent weeks had put the possibility of a cut back on the table, particularly figures that showed employment and retail sales dropping sharply and confidence among both consumers and the housing industry sinking fast. But economists had predicted that the recovery in financial markets, with the prospect of a quick war blowing away the clouds of uncertainty covering the US economy, would keep the Fed on hold. Financial and commodity markets have taken a much more optimistic tone in recent days, beginning to focus on the possibility of a swift and decisive war with Iraq. Before the Fed's announcement yesterday, the futures market had lowered still further its estimate of the probability of a quarter-point cut to less than 20 per cent. Oil prices dropped sharply yesterday, with most key price indices falling by nearly $2 a barrel. The US benchmark crude oil hit $31.75, 20 per cent below its high of $39.99 last month. Traders have been speculating that a war in Iraq would be short and that the US was likely to tap into its strategic stockpile of crude oil. In the run-up to the meeting, US stocks held their gains after the sharp rally on Monday, while the dollar added to its recent gains against the other large currencies. Interest rates have been on hold at 1.25 per cent since November, when the Fed sprang another surprise by cutting borrowing costs by half a percentage point. London Edition 2. "
267,1997-09-30,1997-10-01,Financial Times,Little action keeps markets awake.,"European monetary union and the South-east Asian currency crisis provided at least some action on the London foreign exchange markets yesterday, while the US dollar and the yen were becalmed awaiting interest rates and economic news. Sterling retraced another step against the D-Mark since its steep fall last Friday. Traders said sterling was supported by the statement by Tony Blair, the prime minister, that the government's policy had not changed. The pound rose by a pfennig against the D-Mark, to DM 2.853. Overnight buying had pushed up the pound, but its rally faltered as sellers entered the market when the rate was around the DM 2.86 level. Against the dollar, sterling was virtually unchanged by the close of trading in London, at $1.615. In Asia, news of weaker economic performance in the region undermined further the struggling South-east currencies. The Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso all scraped new lows against the US dollar during trading, after domestic companies there bought dollars to hedge their currency exposures. The Thai baht, however, made a slight recovery. The D-Mark fell early in European trading, after the Bundesbank again left its securities repurchase rate fixed at 3%. The bank last changed the repo rate on 22 August 1996. The dollar was quiet as traders in New York awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The Federal Open Markets Committee meeting also kept the yen sedate, while in Tokyo the latest quarterly Tankan report on business conditions was to be released. There was little reaction in New York when the Fed, as expected, voted to leave US interest rates unchanged. The decision by the FOMC left the Federal Funds rate steady at 5.5%. The Danish krone failed to move against the D-Mark, despite a new opinion poll in Denmark showing a majority supporting ratification of the EU's Amsterdam Treaty. The krone remained rock steady at DKr3.808. * Sterling traded above DM 2.86 in Europe, boosted by the UK government's insistence that its policy about EMU had not changed. Sterling's rise started on Monday, as traders scrambled to cover short positions taken on Friday, when the pound dropped by six pfennigs against the D-Mark on speculation about a change in Labour's position on early entry to European economic and monetary union. But yesterday Mr Blair told the Labour party conference in Brighton that the policy had not shifted. Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said there was likely to be little reward in selling sterling, unless short-term money market rates are perceived to be about to fall quickly. If the UK follows the pattern of Italy or Spain regarding Emu, the gilt yields will be the main area of convergence, followed by the currency later. Yesterday, gilt futures, which had leapt higher on Friday, continued to advance. Mr Chertkow said: ""The markets are more likely to play gilts than the currency."" * The ringgit, rupiah and Philippine peso all hit new lows against the US dollar, after domestic companies sold down their own currencies in a rush to cover their US dollar exposures. The ringgit suffered the most. The ringgit dived to a record low of M$3.25, before ending Asian trading at M$3.2450 from Monday's close of M$3.1950. The Malaysian currency has dropped 29% against the US dollar since July 1, a day before Thailand effectively devalued its currency. The rupiah dropped to a low of Rp3,295 against the US dollar, from Monday's close of Rp3,195, before ending at Rp3,270. The peso sank to a record low of 34.38 pesos and closed at 34.32 pesos from the previous day's 33.99. But some optimistic foreign reserves and exports figures released by the Thai central bank helped the baht to buck the trend. It was quoted at Bt36.20-Bt36.40 to the dollar.

268,1997-09-30,1997-10-01,Financial Times,Europe higher as German rates held.,"Government bond markets drifted mostly higher yesterday ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting on US interest rate policy last night. With expectations that there would be no move from the US, most European bond markets strengthened following the Bundesbank's decision to leave the repo rate unchanged. GERMAN BUNDS firmed in the absence of an interest rate rise, although bund yields again failed to break through the resistance yield level of 5.5%. Analysts saw little chance of a break-through without a strong lead from the US, which also releases non-farm payroll figures this week. The December futures contract in London settled at 102.96, up from 102.88 on Monday, and volumes increased sharply to 130,800 contracts. There had been little expectation of a rate rise. ""The D-Mark is strengthening and there have been satisfactory numbers on producer and consumer prices"", said Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. ""However, we know the next move is going to be up, and the Bundesbank may want to take the market by surprise."" FRENCH OATs were supported by the Bundesbank decision, and yields rose to a 4 basis point discount to bunds. However, traders suggested French investors were still switching from the domestic market into convergence plays in Europe. The December contract in Paris rose from 99.48 to 99.64. ITALIAN BTPs recovered after their sharp declines on Monday. Many investors concluded that, while the Reconstructed Communist party would make a lot of noise over the government's proposed reforms to the pension system, it would not bring down the government. After all, the alternative would most likely be a right wing government, which would take a tougher line on the pension deficit. The December BTP contract clawed back more than a third of Monday's losses, rising 0.32 points to 111.96, with 58,700 contracts traded. Further volatility is expected over the coming weeks, as voting starts on the budget. SPANISH BONOs also followed BTPs upwards, with the December contract in Barcelona increasing 0.34 points to 104.04, on hopes that the Bank of Spain could cut interest rates on Friday. In the UK GILTS market, there was some recovery in spite of the absence of any firmer commitment from the government towards joining Emu. The market had rallied strongly on Friday, after reports of a more positive stance. The benchmark December gilts contract settled at 119 11/32, up 7/32 on the day. But the yield spread over bunds widened another 2 basis points to 104 points. The yield curve has substantially flattened over the last two days, with the spread between two-year and long-dated bonds narrowing by 6 basis points yesterday. Mr Kevin Adams, gilt strategist at BZW in London, said: ""The rise in short-term yields reflects the fact that we are not out of the woods as far as inflation is concerned. The monetary committee may be on hold for the moment, but the next move in rates is still likely to be upwards."" There is a growing expectation that a strengthening in retail sales figures in the lead-up to Christmas could spark another rate rise. Meanwhile, there was further buying of long-dated bonds, as the government revealed that there would be no long-dated auctions in the next quarter. There will be only one issue of 10-year gilts and a new issue of a shorter maturity. This reflects the falling public sector borrowing requirement and should increase demand tension for longer-dated bonds. US TREASURIES drifted lower after the Federal Open Market Committee decided not to change interest rates at its afternoon meeting. By mid-afternoon the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was 1/8 lower at 99 11/16, sending the yield higher to 6.393%. Among shorter-term issues, the two-year note lost 1/32 to 99 29/32, yielding 5.783% while the 10-year note was down 1/32 to 100 5/32, yielding 6.094%. Market analysts had widely expected the Fed not to change rates at the current meeting, although some believe it could move at the next meeting in November. Treasury prices had moved lower throughout the morning. ""There was pretty heavy selling in overseas markets overnight, and that's been weighing on the market,"" said Tom O'Connell, senior government trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. Helping prices somewhat in early trading was a lower than expected reading on business activity in the regional Chicago Purchasing Management report, which slid to 61.2% for September.

In Asia, news of weaker economic performance in the region undermined further the struggling South-east currencies. The Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso all scraped new lows against the US dollar during trading, after domestic companies there bought dollars to hedge their currency exposures. The Thai baht, however, made a slight recovery. The D-Mark fell early in European trading, after the Bundesbank again left its securities repurchase rate fixed at 3%. The bank last changed the repo rate on 22 August 1996. The dollar was quiet as traders in New York awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The Federal Open Markets Committee meeting also kept the yen sedate, while in Tokyo the latest quarterly Tankan report on business conditions was to be released. There was little reaction in New York when the Fed, as expected, voted to leave US interest rates unchanged. The decision by the FOMC left the Federal Funds rate steady at 5.5%. The Danish krone failed to move against the D-Mark, despite a new opinion poll in Denmark showing a majority supporting ratification of the EU's Amsterdam Treaty. The krone remained rock steady at DKr3.808. * Sterling traded above DM 2.86 in Europe, boosted by the UK government's insistence that its policy about EMU had not changed. Sterling's rise started on Monday, as traders scrambled to cover short positions taken on Friday, when the pound dropped by six pfennigs against the D-Mark on speculation about a change in Labour's position on early entry to European economic and monetary union. But yesterday Mr Blair told the Labour party conference in Brighton that the policy had not shifted. Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said there was likely to be little reward in selling sterling, unless short-term money market rates are perceived to be about to fall quickly. If the UK follows the pattern of Italy or Spain regarding Emu, the gilt yields will be the main area of convergence, followed by the currency later. Yesterday, gilt futures, which had leapt higher on Friday, continued to advance. Mr Chertkow said: ""The markets are more likely to play gilts than the currency."" * The ringgit, rupiah and Philippine peso all hit new lows against the US dollar, after domestic companies sold down their own currencies in a rush to cover their US dollar exposures. The ringgit suffered the most. The ringgit dived to a record low of M$3.25, before ending Asian trading at M$3.2450 from Monday's close of M$3.1950. The Malaysian currency has dropped 29% against the US dollar since July 1, a day before Thailand effectively devalued its currency. The rupiah dropped to a low of Rp3,295 against the US dollar, from Monday's close of Rp3,195, before ending at Rp3,270. The peso sank to a record low of 34.38 pesos and closed at 34.32 pesos from the previous day's 33.99. But some optimistic foreign reserves and exports figures released by the Thai central bank helped the baht to buck the trend. It was quoted at Bt36.20-Bt36.40 to the dollar.

270,1997-09-30,1997-10-01,Financial Times,Europe higher as German rates held.,"Government bond markets drifted mostly higher yesterday ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting on US interest rate policy last night. With expectations that there would be no move from the US, most European bond markets strengthened following the Bundesbank's decision to leave the repo rate unchanged. GERMAN BUNDS firmed in the absence of an interest rate rise, although bund yields again failed to break through the resistance yield level of 5.5%. Analysts saw little chance of a break-through without a strong lead from the US, which also releases non-farm payroll figures this week. The December futures contract in London settled at 102.96, up from 102.88 on Monday, and volumes increased sharply to 130,800 contracts. There had been little expectation of a rate rise. ""The D-Mark is strengthening and there have been satisfactory numbers on producer and consumer prices"", said Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. ""However, we know the next move is going to be up, and the Bundesbank may want to take the market by surprise."" FRENCH OATs were supported by the Bundesbank decision, and yields rose to a 4 basis point discount to bunds. However, traders suggested French investors were still switching from the domestic market into convergence plays in Europe. The December contract in Paris rose from 99.48 to 99.64. ITALIAN BTPs recovered after their sharp declines on Monday. Many investors concluded that, while the Reconstructed Communist party would make a lot of noise over the government's proposed reforms to the pension system, it would not bring down the government. After all, the alternative would most likely be a right wing government, which would take a tougher line on the pension deficit. The December BTP contract clawed back more than a third of Monday's losses, rising 0.32 points to 111.96, with 58,700 contracts traded. Further volatility is expected over the coming weeks, as voting starts on the budget. SPANISH BONOs also followed BTPs upwards, with the December contract in Barcelona increasing 0.34 points to 104.04, on hopes that the Bank of Spain could cut interest rates on Friday. In the UK GILTS market, there was some recovery in spite of the absence of any firmer commitment from the government towards joining Emu. The market had rallied strongly on Friday, after reports of a more positive stance. The benchmark December gilts contract settled at 119 11/32, up 7/32 on the day. But the yield spread over bunds widened another 2 basis points to 104 points.<The yield curve has substantially flattened over the last two days, with the spread between two-year and long-dated bonds narrowing by 6 basis points yesterday. Mr Kevin Adams, gilt strategist at BZW in London, said: ""The rise in short-term yields reflects the fact that we are not out of the woods as far as inflation is concerned. The monetary committee may be on hold for the moment, but the next move in rates is still likely to be upwards."" There is a growing expectation that a strengthening in retail sales figures in the lead-up to Christmas could spark another rate rise. Meanwhile, there was further buying of long-dated bonds, as the government revealed that there would be no long-dated auctions in the next quarter. There will be only one issue of 10-year gilts and a new issue of a shorter maturity. This reflects the falling public sector borrowing requirement and should increase demand tension for longer-dated bonds. US TREASURIES drifted lower after the Federal Open Market Committee decided not to change interest rates at its afternoon meeting. By mid-afternoon the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was 1/8 lower at 99 11/16, sending the yield higher to 6.393%. Among shorter-term issues, the two-year note lost 1/32 to 99 29/32, yielding 5.783% while the 10-year note was down 1/32 to 100 5/32, yielding 6.094%. Market analysts had widely expected the Fed not to change rates at the current meeting, although some believe it could move at the next meeting in November.<Treasury prices had moved lower throughout the morning. ""There was pretty heavy selling in overseas markets overnight, and that's been weighing on the market,"" said Tom O'Connell, senior government trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. Helping prices somewhat in early trading was a lower than expected reading on business activity in the regional Chicago Purchasing Management report, which slid to 61.2% for September.

271,2008-03-18,2008-03-19,Financial Times,Stocks surge on Fed cut.,"US stocks staged their biggest rally in more than five years yesterday as confidence in the stability of the financial system grew and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 75 basis points to 2.25 per cent.  The rate reduction was smaller than many in the markets had expected but investors overcame their initial disappointment, and shares, which had been up strongly before the Fed action, closed still higher.  In cutting rates, the US central bank tried to balance the threats to growth and inflation. However, in a rare move, two members of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee dissented in favour of a 50bp cut, indicating the depth of resistance at the Fed to even a 75bp move.  The size of the cut, while large by historical standards, suggests the Fed believes it will not be able to solve the credit crisis through monetary policy alone.  The central bank said the ""outlook for economic growth has weakened further"" and ""downside risks remain"", leaving the door open to further cuts in the main Fed funds rate at subsequent policy meetings. The Fed also cut the discount rate at which it provides emergency finance by 75bp to 2.5 per cent.  However, the Fed hardened its language on inflation, making it clear that policymakers had not cut rates by 100bp because of concerns about price pressures. ""Inflation has been elevated and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen,"" the Fed said. It said policymakers expected inflation to moderate but believed ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased"".  The Fed's decision reflects policymakers' determination to signal that while they are focused on fighting growth risks, they are not ignoring inflation. Officials worry that if they cut rates too far, the bond market could rebel, pushing up long- term interest rates and, with them, mortgage rates. In recent days, the US central bank has taken aggressive measures to boost the supply of liquidity to markets, including a new emergency finance facility for investment banks.  The S&P 500 yesterday gained 54.14 points, or 4.24 per cent, to 1,330.74. It was the biggest gain in percentage terms since October 15 2002.  ""Initially, the market was disappointed but it appears the market thinks that if the Fed just needs to cut by 75bp, things may not be as bad as feared,"" said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman. ""It means the Fed can save some bullets.""  The S&P investment bank index advanced 16.7 per cent as investors were buoyed by better-than-expected results from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. European markets closed ahead, with the FTSE 100 up 3.5 per cent.  Ted Wieseman, Morgan Stanley economist, said: ""The FOMC meeting actually ended up being a relatively minor event compared to the day's main theme - a big sigh of relief about financial sector stability.""  Yields on short-term Treasuries rose as investors turned away from the safe haven of government debt and bought mortgage and corporate bonds. The dollar strengthened.  Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, admitted that ""the economy has turned down sharply"", though he avoided the word recession. He told NBC the ""big focus on the part of all policymakers is to minimise the spillover to the real economy"".  Building permits fell 7.8 per cent in February. Investors speculated that a 30 per cent capital surcharge on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing financiers, could be lifted, sending their shares up 27 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively "
272,2008-03-18,2008-03-19,Financial Times,Fed rate cut helps shore up investor confidence.,"Global stock markets rallied strongly yesterday as a cut in US interest rates and better earnings than expected from investment banks Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers helped shore up sagging investor confidence.  The US central bank lowered the Fed funds rate by 75 basis points to 2.25 per cent, disappointing many investors who had been hoping for a full percentage point cut. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee wanted less aggressive action.  James Knightley, economist at ING, said liquidity conditions and market sentiment would need to improve significantly to prevent the Fed having to come in and cut rates further.  He said: ""Default risk and counterparty concerns will linger on and with further writedowns still probable, access to credit will continue to be constrained.  ""This presents an ongoing risk to the economic outlook and so we expect the Fed to push the Fed funds target rate down to 1 per cent in the coming months.""  Credit spreads narrowed sharply on both sides of the Atlantic, with the investment-grade iTraxx Europe and CDX North America indices both falling back from the record highs struck on Monday.  And there was a much more positive tone to equity markets as financials rallied strongly. By mid-afternoon in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.7 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.4 per cent higher.  In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index jumped 3.5 per cent as the banking sub-index jumped 6 per cent.  Asian stocks staged a more modest rally, with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo bouncing 1.5 per cent from Monday's 2 1/2-year low, Hong Kong gaining 1.4 per cent and Singapore 1.6 per cent.  But Chinese equities fell 4 per cent to an eight-month low after Wen Jiabao, the premier, pledged ""forceful"" measures to fight inflation, prompting fears of higher interest rates.  After the market closed, the People's Bank of China lifted the bank reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to a record 15.5 per cent, the fifteenth increase since mid-2006.  Jing Ulrich, chairman of China equities at JPMorgan, noted that despite inflation running at an 11-year high, China had not raised interest rates since December.  She said: ""This would suggest that China is taking a 'wait and see' approach on interest rate policy, perhaps because the most recent spike in inflation was heavily influenced by a one-off event - record snowstorms that caused supply shortages and transport bottlenecks.""  However, signs of stress remained in the money markets as three-month sterling Libor hit a fresh high for the year of 5.97 per cent, and the three-month euro rate rose for a 15th successive session.  An additional Euros 25bn was pumped into eurozone money markets by the European Central Bank  Lena Komileva, economist at Tullett Prebon, warned that credit markets remained squeezed as recent events ""outline the seriousness of a situation where liquidity problems can quickly translate into insolvency.""  She said: ""As we near the Easter holiday and the quarter-end, this has underpinned banks' preference to hoard cash and their reluctance to take on even good quality credit on their balance sheet"".  Government bonds suffered a steep sell-off as stock markets rallied. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose 11 basis points to 3.40 per cent, while the two-year yield added 18bp to 1.52 per cent.  In Europe, the two-year Schatz yield jumped 18bp to 3.13 per cent while the 10-year Japanese government bond yield climbed 5bp to 1.32 per cent.  In the currency markets , the dollar remained under pressure against the euro although it regained some ground against the yen and the Swiss franc.  Sterling bounced off Monday's record low against the euro as robust UK inflation data encouraged investors to scale back expectations for further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.  In commodities , oil prices rose as the Fed rate cut helped to fuel expectations of increased demand. April West Texas Intermediate rose Dollars 2.12 to Dollars 107.80 a barrel.  Gold trimmed an early advance but managed to hold above the psychologically important Dollars 1,000 an ounce level and base metals prices rallied following Monday's hefty losses. Tin struck a record high and copper also advanced. "
273,2008-03-18,2008-03-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Ask the oil producers to rescue Wall Street.,"The fire sale of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank, brings the credit crisis to a new, more dangerous phase. Many market participants seem to be hoping for a short-term miracle from the Federal Reserve to end the turmoil. They will be disappointed.  Bear Stearns could not borrow because its creditor banks and counterparties use modern risk management systems that require them to hold enough capital to meet potential losses on their portfolios. When the ""value at risk"" of its portfolio rises, a bank must either raise more capital to support the additional risk or shrink the risk (by selling assets, demanding larger ""haircuts"" - cash safety margins - from investors or not rolling over loans).  As the credit crisis has continued, banks' measured risks have rocketed. At the same time, banks have suffered losses that have depleted their capital. This combination of factors has brought the US financial system to its knees. Credit lines are being withdrawn as banks try to ratchet down the risks they face. That Bear Stearns could fetch only $2 per share, when a week earlier it was trading at $70 per share, is the best available proof that banks' appetite for risk-taking has vanished. This could be the beginning of a massive global credit crunch.  Several conclusions follow. First, since the largest intermediaries do not have enough capital to support their measured risks, they will keep trying to shrink their balance sheets unless they can rebuild their capital (or, magically, their perceived risk falls). This explains why the Fed's liquidity measures such as the term auction facility, the term securities lending facility and the new primary dealer credit facility are likely to be temporary patches that do not stop the distress.  Banks want to shrink risk exposure, not maintain or expand it. Liquidity support by the Fed is an invitation to borrow from the central bank for on-lending to others - that is, to expand balance sheets. On the contrary, the banks and brokers want to contract their balance sheets.  Second, the Fed is not well-equipped to deal with this problem. To create real capital it would need to make outright purchases of impaired collateral at above-market prices. This would amount to a publicly funded shareholder bail-out. This is not the central bank's job and the Fed knows it.  Third, recapitalising the banks should be the priority. For a start, the suspension of dividends (even by well-capitalised banks) will free up lending capacity. However, this is unlikely to be enough and will take time. New capital needs to be found soon. Existing shareholders will no doubt resist dilution, but they must not be allowed to stand in the way of a solution. These are the very shareholders who allowed their banks to create the current mess, which now threatens to cripple the financial system.  The quickest solution is to identify some buyers before the next spiral down. One obvious set of buyers are the Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. They have stepped up once and were burnt on their first wave of investments. But since the January meeting of the Fed's open market committee, when the central bank made it abundantly clear that it will try everything possible to stave off collapse, oil prices have risen from roughly $92 a barrel to $109 (as of March 18). Other commodity prices have also risen over this period. Given the deteriorating prospects for the global economy over this time, a plausible interpretation is that some of the financing that might have gone to the financial institutions has instead been directed towards buying commodities such as oil. This portfolio reallocation represents a pure windfall for the oil producers.  Middle Eastern oil countries produce roughly 25m barrels of oil a day. If they could be persuaded to recycle $4 a barrel of the $17 price run up since the January Federal open market committee meeting, this would represent $4bn of capital that could be deployed; Bear Stearns was sold for $250m. Admittedly, this is a conversation for Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state, and not Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, to have. But it is worth recalling that the firms that bailed out Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 in fact profited nicely, and relatively quickly. Conversely, if a full-blown credit crunch ensues, the fallout to the world economy is likely to be large enough to pull the price of oil back down sharply.  Finally, in case our proposal sounds unpalatable, it should be compared with the alternative in which the banking system deteriorates to the point where a public recapitalisation be-comes inevitable. Direct government ownership should be the last resort but failure to move soon could make it the only option left on the table.

274,2008-03-18,2008-03-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Overview: Robust Morgan Stanley offset by Fed caution.,"Uncertainty reigned in the markets on Wednesday as rumours of further casualties in the financial sector offset another encouraging set of results from US banks and positive news on the housing front.  There was plenty of debate about the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 75 basis points on Tuesday, rather than the full percentage point markets had been factoring in.  Peter Possing Andersen, senior analyst at Danske Bank, said that the forward-looking part of the Fed's accompanying statement left little doubt that the Fed continued to be biased towards further easing, although there were important signals that the Fed would be moving forward in a more cautious manner.  ""Generally, Tuesday's action indicates that the Fed is not willing to satisfy market expectations at any level or at any given cost of long-term credibility,"" said Mr Andersen.  ""Moreover, this is a signal that the FOMC is now willing to take charge of market expectations in an attempt to avoid being forced into an undesirable steep path of monetary easing.""  US and European equity markets struggled to build on Tuesday's hefty gains, despite robust figures from Morgan Stanley and news that regulators had eased capital requirements for home finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, allowing them to inject more money into the mortgage market.  By midday in New York, the S&P 500 index was flat, a day after surging 4.2 per cent - its biggest one-day rally for five years. the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower.  In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.9 per cent, with Sweden's Ericsson down 7.8 per cent after issuing a profits warning. Steep losses for UK banks in early trade prompted Britain's financial authorities to issue a statement declaring that they were not aware of problems at any bank and would investigate share price moves.  But Asian stocks rallied across the board, with the Nikkei 225 Average climbing 2.5 per cent, Hong Kong 2.3 per cent and Sydney 4 per cent. Even Shanghai managed to break a five-day losing streak as it gained 2.5 per cent.  There was a better tone to credit spreads as the investment grade iTraxx Europe index fell 13.5 basis points to 119.5bp and the CDX North America index dropped 10bp to 151bp. Both measures touched record highs on Monday.  Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs, said he believed the ""credit clouds"" were beginning to clear.  ""Supportive policy actions by the Fed, in terms of both short-term funding provision and interest rate policy, should help foster stability in the credit markets going forward,"" he said. ""The trend will be towards tighter spreads over the next couple months.""  But there was no sign of a let-up in money market strains as interbank lending rates continued to rise.  Three-month sterling Libor rose to 5.98 per cent, its ninth successive increase and the highest level this year. The three-month euro rate pushed up to 4.67 per cent and three-month dollar Libor increased by more than 5bp - its largest one-day rise for two months.  Government bonds continued to benefit from uncertainty about the economic outlook and volatility in other asset prices.  The Treasury yield curve flattened as the two-year yield fell 2 basis points to 1.61 per cent and the thirty-year fell 10bp to 4.25 per cent. The gap between the two maturities was close to 300bp just a few days ago - the widest for four years.  In Europe, the ten-year Bund yield fell 2bp to 3.74 per cent while the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell 4bp to 1.26 per cent.  In the currency markets, the dollar came under renewed pressure against the yen as an overnight bounce against the Japanese unit following the Fed rate cut ran out of steam.  Sterling dropped sharply as the rumours that a UK bank was in trouble were compounded by increased expectations for near-term interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.  Commodities fell sharply across the board as funds reduced their risk, with gold retreating below the $1,000 an ounce level and silver sliding to a three-week low.  Oil fell sharply as weekly US inventories data showed clear signs of weakening demand.  "
275,2003-05-06,2003-05-07,Financial Times,Fed's new tools shape expectation.,"Fed's new tools shape expectation - The central bank betrays a fear of deflation by splitting its assessment, says Alan Beattie. The Fed's unusually detailed outlook on the economy that accompanied its decision on interest rates yesterday represents a significant step towards greater transparency in one of the more cryptic central banks. The Fed's decision to split its balance of risks assessment into separate judgments about growth and inflation was hailed by former Fed policymakers as a welcome move towards explaining its thinking. But the fact that it took such an unexpected step suggests it was prodded by concern about deflation, and took a calculated risk in making its views so explicit. The normal assessment of the balance of risks to the economy - which several years ago replaced an even more opaque statement that gave the ""policy bias"" of the committee - weighs the risks of too-low growth against the risk of too-high inflation. But these choices appear redundant at a time when inflation is falling dangerously close to zero, and the Fed is anxious to stop deflationary psychology taking hold. Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor now at the University of California at Berkeley, says: ""A statement where the only possibilities are growth being too weak or inflation being too strong doesn't really characterise the current situation."" By splitting out the assessment of growth and inflation risks, the Fed has given itself more tools to manage expectations. With yesterday's statement, it signalled that higher growth in the absence of imminent inflationary pressure would not necessarily cause it to raise interest rates. Economists said the implicit focus on avoiding deflation was extraordinarily strong. As Robert DiClemente at Citigroup put it: ""Policymakers are comfortable that chances for better growth have improved. That judgment could have run the risk of igniting premature expectations of higher policy-driven interest rates. Today, the FOMC has severed that logic."" In this sense, the statement can be read as a mild version of the strategy that the Fed has already discussed internally: a binding commitment to keep interest rates on hold until the risk of deflation has been banished. ""This statement appears designed to keep bond yields low to protect the stock market,"" Prof Yellen says. That strategy was not without risks: the overall judgment that the risks were weighted towards weakness might have spooked the markets. But if the Fed's intention was as Prof Yellen surmises, it worked just fine yesterday, with interest-rate expectations falling with little dent in the stock market's hefty gains. Other former Fed officials joined Prof Yellen in praising the subtlety of the move. Stephen Cecchetti, former chief economist at the New York Fed, said it was a significant improvement. Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: ""This is an intelligent way of signalling that the threshold for cutting rates in coming months has become lower."" But both Mr Cecchetti and Mr Meyer questioned why an overall assessment of risks, adding inflation and growth, was published when separate judgments had been given. ""The only question I would raise is the need to publish a potentially confusing and redundant final sentence (in the statement),"" Mr Meyer said. Indeed, maintaining the overall risk assessment raised the possibility that the disaggregated version would be discontinued if the deflationary threat goes away. But if the pleased reaction of former Fed officials means anything, it might well be here to stay. US Edition 2. "
276,2003-05-06,2003-05-07,Financial Times,US economy - THE LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Reserve, in its decision to leave its primary interest rate on hold at 1.25 per cent and to fudge its statement, followed the lead set by Alan Greenspan in his testimony before Congress last week. The Federal open market committee is hoping for a noticeable improvement in economic activity now that the war in Iraq and $40 a barrel oil are behind us. So far, consumer confidence surveys aside, the only sign of such a postwar rebound has been a more buoyant stock market and tighter credit spreads. The Treasury market is another story. The recent readings on production and employment - and the balance of data since last November - have been disappointing. With interest rates so low, and the prospect that unorthodox monetary policy might unnerve investors, the FOMC is waiting for a clearer read of the postwar data. That is reasonable. But it is hard to see how the upside and downside risks to growth are roughly equal. The Fed says that ""the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation"". In that case, it seems obvious that the balance of risks between maintaining price stability and sustainable economic growth are weighted towards weakness. The tortuous wording of the Fed's statement must reflect disagreements on the FOMC. But, word play aside, if the data remain weak the Fed is going to have to act. London Edition 2. "
277,1990-11-13,1990-11-14,Financial Times,United States treasury bonds up after signs of deterioration in manufacturing sector.,"US Treasury bonds moved broadly higher yesterday as signs of a further deterioration in the US manufacturing sector added to the market's bullishness. Longer-dated maturities posted strong gains throughout the day following the release of US industrial production figures for October, which fell 0.8 per cent, further than the expected 0.5 per cent. The market now expects the Fed to loosen monetary policy before the weekend, following yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where policy decisions are made. In spite of the overall optimism, trading was quiet and volume will probably remain thin until the Fed sends a clear signal about monetary policy. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond added 1 1/32 at 102 11/32, yielding 8.52 per cent. The gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was only 1/32 higher for a yield of 7.57 per cent. The Fed refrained from operating in the open market and Fed Funds traded at 7 per cent through most of the day. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1990. "
278,1990-11-13,1990-11-14,Financial Times,Foreign Exchanges: Nervous pound improves,"STERLING GAINED a little ground on the foreign exchanges yesterday, despite gloomy economic news and an attack on British government policy towards Europe by Sir Geoffrey Howe, who recently resigned as UK deputy prime minister. The threat to Mrs Margaret Thatcher's position as prime minister showed no sign of abating, amid rumours of a challenge to her leadership of the Conservative party. UK economic news was weaker than expected and tended to confirm a trend towards recession. Industrial production fell 0.4 per cent in September, against a revised drop of 0.6 per cent in August. City analysts were looking for a fall of 0.3 per cent. Manufacturing industry, stripping out energy production, appeared to be even weaker, falling 1.1 per cent, compared with 0.9 per cent the previous month. Forecasts pointed towards a drop of about 0.5 per cent. Dealers said that the data pointed towards a cut in UK bank base rates, although the pound's weak position in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System restricts the authorities room for manoeuvre. Sterling's overall position at the bottom of the ERM showed little change. The pound improved against the D-Mark, rising to DM2.9075 from DM2.9050. It also gained 20 points to Dollars 1.9645, while rising to FFr9.7775 from FFr9.7625; to SFr2.4600 from SFr2.4525; and to Y254.50 from Y252.50. On Bank of England figures sterling's index eased 0.1 to 93.9. The dollar traded quietly, waiting for any signs of monetary easing after yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market committee. Mr John Taylor, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, said that long-term interest rates should fall as a result of the US budget cutting agreement. He added that there was a risk of recession and that the Fed's stated policy would imply lower rates if the economy weakened substantially. At last night's close in London the dollar had eased to a record closing low of DM1.4800 from DM1.4805, but was a little firmer against most other currencies, rising to FFr4.9775 from FFr4.9750; to SFr1.2525 from SFr1.2500; and to Y129.55 from Y128.70. The dollar's index was unchanged at 60.1. This month's rise in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate has provided support for the D-Mark. In Frankfurt the Bundesbank did not intervene when the dollar was fixed at a record low of DM1.4788 against DM1.4793 on Monday. The German currency was also strong in terms of the Japanese yen, rising to Y87.55 from Y86.95 at the London close. The D-Mark improved to FFr3.3612 from FFr3.3607 at the Paris fixing, but higher Italian interest rates helped the lira recover. In Milan the D-Mark fell to L752.21 from a record L752.76 at the fixing. "
279,1990-11-13,1990-11-14,Financial Times,Government Bonds: Early rally peters out over Tory leadership worries,"A RALLY in the British government bond market, based partly on weak industrial production figures, petered out in the afternoon as worries about the leadership of the British government reasserted themselves. However, dealers reported genuine institutional buying over the last two days, based on the confirmation of UK economic weakness. One benchmark government bond - the 11 3/4 per cent of 2003-7 - closed the day yielding 11.41 per cent, compared with about 11.42 per cent at the previous close. More positive interpretations of prospects for real interest rates in the UK appear to have been behind a sharp jump in index-linked issues - particularly at the long-end of the market. The index linked issue maturing in 2024 jumped an unusually sharp 1 5/32 point to 92 5/16 . IN GERMANY, there was a similar picture, though for differing reasons. A continuation of Monday's largely technical rally in the morning was reversed by the close, with the key bund futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closing at 82.08, against Monday's 82.07, and it weakened further after hours to 82.04. Reports suggesting larger borrowing by the Federal government next year - of up to DM150bn, even after some DM30bn-35bn in spending cuts - depressed the market. So did the prospect of a nudge upwards in money market rates by the Bundesbank today. The new 9 per cent Bund closed at 100.08 to yield 8.983 per cent, up fractionally on the day. US Treasury bonds moved broadly higher yesterday as signs of a further deterioration in the US manufacturing sector added to the market's bullishness. Longer-dated maturities posted strong gains throughout the day following the release of US industrial production figures for October, which fell 0.8 per cent, further than the expected 0.5 per cent. The market now expects the Fed to loosen monetary policy before the weekend, following yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where policy decisions are made. In spite of the overall optimism, trading was quiet and volume will probably remain thin until the Fed sends a clear signal about monetary policy. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond added 1 1/32 at 102 11/32 , yielding 8.52 per cent. The gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was only 1/32 higher for a yield of 7.57 per cent. The Fed refrained from operating in the open market and Fed Funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, traded at 7 per cent through most of the day. However, the lack of intervention did not have any policy implications. THE FRENCH government bond market ended generally firmer, although the strength was concentrated at the long end of the market, causing the yield curve to flatten. The 10-year contract on the Matif futures exchange in Paris ended up 32 basis points at 98.38. But short interest rates came under pressure amid speculation that the Bundesbank could tighten German rates again soon, testing the strength of the franc. The strong performance of a FFr3bn 8-year Eurobond issued by the Kingdom of Spain prompted activity at that area of the yield curve, as underwriters covered short positions they had taken. "

285,1999-03-30,1999-03-31,Financial Times,Fed leaves rates unchanged.,"The US Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged yesterday. The central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee held the rate on overnight loans between banks at 4.75 per cent - its level since November. The decision comes amid continuing signs of strong economic activity in the US and low inflation. The Fed Reserve cut rates three times last Autumn to protect the economy from a slump caused by global financial turmoil. The Fed did not indicate yesterday whether it had changed its ""bias"" towards tighter or looser monetary policy depending on the perceived balance of risks. The Fed has not announced any change in its policy stance since December when it maintained a neutral bias adopted in November. Since then the central bank has altered its disclosure policy so that any significant changes in its bias is publicly announced. Yesterday's position suggested the Fed remained neutral. The decision was announced after a survey suggested consumer optimism, critical to buoyant economic activity in the US, continued to rise as Americans shrugged off last year's concerns about the impact of global weakness. Their expectations of further improvements in economic conditions also rose on the back of a strong job market. The Conference Board, a private sector research group, said its index of consumer confidence edged up in March for the fifth consecutive month, to 133.9 from an upwardly revised 133.1 in February. The expectations index rose to 104.7 from 103.4 in February. Edward McKelvy, senior economist with Goldman Sachs in New York, said: ""The labour market is still looking pretty friendly from the point of view of someone who is looking for a job."" He said the survey contrasted with expectations that job availability would drop off after a strong winter because of warmer weather. More than 48 per cent in the survey of 5,000 households said jobs were plentiful, up from last month, and the proportion of consumers claiming jobs were ""hard to get"" remained at an all-time low of 11.8 per cent. ""Consumers were more optimistic in the first quarter of this year than they were at the end of last year,"" said Lyee Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Centre. ""Their appraisal of current business conditions continues to sail at record high levels, with no signs confidence will erode anytime soon"". Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

286,1999-03-30,1999-03-31,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries higher as FOMC meets.,"US Treasuries were mostly higher in early trading as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee met to decide interest rate policy. European markets were quiet, distracted by discussions on interest rates in the US and events in Kosovo. Russian prime minister Yevgeny Primakov's talks with Slobodon Milosovic, the Serb leader, gave a little boost in late trading. By late morning, as the Fed continued talks, the 30-year benchmark Treasury bond had gained 3/8 to 94, sending the yield down to 5.616 per cent. Among shorter-term issues 10-year notes were down 1/16 at 96 1/4, yielding 5.251 per cent, and two-year notes were off 1/32 at 99, yielding 5.025 per cent. The early rise at the long end of the curve was seen as a partial unwinding from Monday's sharp sell-off as buyers returned cautiously to the market. The recent flight to quality at the short end, triggered by concerns over Kosovo, had largely faded early yesterday. ""These flight to quality bids don't last and the Dow 10,000 put pressure on the [bond] market,"" said David Ging, market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette in New York. The release of the Conference Board's confidence index showed a rise of one point to 133.9, indicating slightly better sentiment about current and forthcoming conditions. The markets await several key reports later this week, including the employment survey on Friday. European markets were ""surprise-free,"" said Alison Cottrell at PaineWebber, ""a continuation of the past few days"". The short end of the European yield curve, especially two-year paper, saw continued firmness in the expectation of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank next month. The ECB's case for cutting rates will have gained sharpness after the European Commission's downward revision yesterday of euro-zone gross domestic product growth forecasts for 1999. The Commission cut its euro-zone growth forecast from 2.6 per cent to 2.2 per cent, in line with OECD forecasts, although some analysts still consider the number optimistic. In any case, it provided ammunition for those supporting a rate cut. They also saw some hope in Hans Tietmeyer's comments late on Monday that ""continuity does not signify immobility"", which they interpreted as ""not discouraging the expectation of a rate cut"". This represents a subtle shift by officials over the past month as weaknesses have emerged in euro-zone economies. Comments yesterday by Eugenio Domingo Solans, a member of the ECB, also pointed to an easing of monetary policy. In Germany, the 10-year bund futures contract closed up at 113.80, after late gains, while in the cash market the yield on the 10-year bund was 4.04 per cent. UK gilts ended up by a wafer. The June gilt future settled at 117, up slightly on the day in shallow trading. In Japan, weak data helped Japanese government bonds rally as equities lost ground on the last but one day before the end-of-year reporting season, when the country's troubled banks must post capital adequacy ratios in line with international standards. A strong stock market helps banks and others achieve healthier balance sheets. Yesterday's data underlines the problems hitting the Japanese economy. There has been such an flood of weak data that JGBs have become immune to the flow. But the latest figures were so bad that government securities gained firmly. Unemployment reached a record 4.6 per cent in February, up from 4.4 per cent in January, while household spending fell in February month-on-month, dropping to a 13-year low. In Tokyo, the benchmark 10-year 203 JGB rallied by 7 basis points pushing the yield down to 1.58 per cent. This performance, said Joanne Collins at Daiwa, ""showed investors are prepared to buy into this markets ... demonstrating, too, no fear of what may happen to interest rates in the US"".

287,2002-11-06,2002-11-07,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Sharp cut in rates boosts Treasuries BENCHMARK BONDS.,"The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee's decision to cut interest rates sharply yesterday pushed Treasuries higher as the Fed signalled its concern with the struggling US economy. The Fed cut the 1.75 per cent Federal funds rate by 50 basis points, surprising the market which had only expected a 25bp cut. Rates have remained unchanged at 1.75 per cent since December 2001. The Fed said that ""greater uncertainty"" has been inhibiting spending, production and employment but that inflation pressures remain contained. Traders had earlier sold US Treasuries ahead of an influx of new supply. Some $18bn of 10-year notes was auctioned yesterday afternoon. There are also fears that the supply of Treasury securities next year will be greater than expected as a result of the Republicans' success in Tuesday's election. The Republicans now control Congress and are anticipated to pursue tax cuts and fiscal spending programs. This could increase the deficit, thereby requiring the government to issue more debt. The new Congress takes over on January 3. After the FOMC's decision, the 10-year note was up 9/32 to 102 11/16 to yield 4.037 per cent while the 30-year bond had gained 1/16 to 104 7/16 with a yield of 5.076 per cent. The two-year note was 1/8 higher to 100 to yield 1.755 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were little changed yesterday and the volumes were thin as most investors were waiting for the European Central Bank's decision on interest rates which is due today. The yield on the two-year Schatz bond was flat at 3.17 per cent. The yield on the 10-year German bund was also little changed at 4.61 per cent. The 10-year German bund future rose 0.08 to 110.41. Japanese government bonds retreated yesterday as investors locked into profits ahead of a five-year bond auction. The benchmark 10-year cash JGB tumbled following a six-day rally which had pushed yields to a four-year low of 0.955 per cent earlier in the week. The market also remained under pressure as investors stayed on sidelines ahead of an auction of Y1,900bn worth of five-year bonds offered by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday. The new issue is expected to have a coupon set at 0.3 per cent, a level likely to generate appetite from the market, according to analysts. Bond prices had surged following the government's release of a key economic package last week which did not include explicit extra fiscal spending to support the ailing economy. Traders said the market was likely to stay well supported in coming weeks. The key December 10-year JGB futures contract fell 0.18 to 141.97, while the benchmark 243rd 10-year cash JGB fell 0.181 to 101.122, pushing up the yield by 0.020 to 0.975 per cent. London Edition 1.

289,2003-10-28,2003-10-29,Financial Times,Words and deeds THE LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Reserve had no reason to change interest rates and saw no reason to change its statement significantly. Its view on the balance of risks to growth and inflation/ disinflation remains a fair reflection of the fundamentals. But, as encouraging data continue to accumulate, the policy stance will only become harder to explain. Questions about the recovery's sustainability next year have not gone away. As the Fed noted in the one tweak in its statement, the labour market appears to be stabilising. But employment and wage growth will be required to sustain household spending as the impact of tax cuts and mortgage refinancing fades. Meanwhile, there are positive signs of business confidence - including the flurry of mergers and acquisitions activity - but we await hard evidence of strong business demand. Part of the problem is the lack of business pricing power. The core consumer price index fell to a multi-year low in September. With unemployment above 6 per cent and capacity utilisation below 75 per cent, there is plenty of slack. The Fed's repeated judgment that the risk of disinflation will be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future and that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period is reasonable. Yet the market is pricing in more than 100 basis points of tightening next year. Defining a range for inflation that the FOMC considers consistent with price stability remains the common sense option that Greenspan &Co resist. That would allow market participants to focus on data rather than rhetoric. As it is, the rhetoric suggests there is value at the short end of the curve but actions speak louder than words. US Edition 1. "
290,2003-10-28,2003-10-29,Financial Times,Fed keeps rates steady and holds line on inflation.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday and signalled that the strong growth over the summer had not caused it to shift its signals about future rate movements. The decision to keep rates on hold was almost universally expected. But most attention focused on the statement that the Fed's open market committee released with the decision, which was almost unchanged from previous meetings, defying speculation that the Fed might begin to soften its commitment to holding rates at a low level. The statement maintained the stance taken by the committee in previous meetings that the potential damage from too-low inflation was its predominant concern and that the risks surrounding inflation continued to be on the downside. It also retained the wording used at the previous two meetings that ""policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period"", suggesting that the Fed wanted to see more evidence of sustained growth and inflationary pressure before it started signalling future rises in interest rates. The one change in the statement was a tentative acknowledgement of the stronger performance seen from the US jobs market over the past month, following the increase in payroll jobs in September and subsequent falls in new claims for jobless benefits. While the Fed's previous statement in September said that the labour market had been weakening, yesterday's said it ""appears to be stabilising"". Long-term interest rates, which had been drifting up after the release of encouraging economic data in the run-up to yesterday's meeting, reversed after the announcement. The dollar slid as the prospect of lower rates on US assets hurt the currency. Earlier, the dollar had set a fresh three-year low against the yen in Asian trading. Data released before the meeting suggested that the prospects for capital spending and consumption were both good. Durable goods orders rose 0.8 per cent in September, below many economists' forecasts. But orders data for August, which had shown a 1.1 per cent drop, were revised to show a drop of just 0.1 per cent, suggesting there was more underlying strength in investment than previously thought. The durable goods orders raised hopes that business investment, for so long the missing element of the recovery, was at last showing sustained strength. Non-defence capital goods, which are often seen as a proxy for business investment, rose 3.9 per cent last month. A regular survey of consumer sentiment by the Conference Board showed an unexpectedly strong improvement, with the report's headline index rising to 81.1 in October from a revised 77 the previous month. Markets, Page 28 Wall Street gains, Page 30 For continuing reaction to the FOMC decision, see www.ft.com/markets Europe outlook brightens Europe's fragile recovery showed signs of picking up speed yesterday with a key German business confidence indicator improving for the sixth month running in October, writes Tony Major in Frankfurt.The Ifo economic institute said its German business climate index had jumped to its highest level since February 2001, driven partly by a brighter assessment of current economic conditions. The rise coincided with improvements in business sentiment in Belgium and the Netherlands, although in Italy confidence slipped for the second month in a row. The findings were hailed by Otmar Issing, European Central Bank chief economist, as pointers to stronger growth in the second half of the year. US Edition 1. "
291,2003-10-28,2003-10-29,Financial Times,Wall St strides forward as Fed holds rates steady AMERICAS.,"US stocks were higher by the close of trade after the Federal Reserve left benchmark interest rates unchanged and said labour markets appeared to be stabilising. Economic data underscored the recovery while a pick-up in M&A activity also bolstered the market. Peter Cardillo, chief investment strategist at Global Partner Securities, said morning gains owed a lot to the economic data as well as continuing positive earnings news. Like most market watchers, he expected the US central bank to leave benchmark borrowing costs unchanged but was waiting for the Fed's accompanying statement. ""The Fed's language is going to be extremely important. They're going to have to address rising commodity prices, the improving economy and prospects for inflation rather than deflation,"" Mr Cardillo said. In the event, the Fed's statement said: ""The evidence ... confirms that spending is firming, and the labour market appears to be stabilising."" Its Federal Open Market Committee assessed the upside and downside risks in the economy to be evenly balanced. Investors took in figures showing increasing orders for durable goods in September as well as August, whose number was revised. In addition, a key gauge of consumer confidence rose in October by more than expected, reflecting the effects of an improving labour market and a rising equity market. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 9,748.31, while the broader S&P 500 was 1.5 per cent higher at 1,046.79. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.6 per cent to 1,932.26. RJ Reynolds, which has agreed to buy British American Tobacco's US unit Brown &Williamson, reported a quarterly loss of $3.45bn, or $41.31 per share, down from a profit of $139m, or $1.56 per share, a year earlier as restructuring charges bit. But RJ Reynolds shares were up 13.2 per cent to $48.97 as investors welcomed news of the merger to create the second-biggest tobacco group in the US. Altria Group, owner of Philip Morris, saw its shares rise 1.9 per cent to $46.17 amid upbeat sentiment in the tobacco sector.

292,2003-10-28,2003-10-29,Financial Times,Wall St strides forward as Fed holds rates steady AMERICAS.,"US stocks were higher in afternoon trade after the Federal Reserve left benchmark interest rates unchanged and said labour markets appeared to be stabilising. Economic data underscored the recovery while a pick-up in M&A activity also bolstered the market. Peter Cardillo, chief investment strategist at Global Partner Securities, said morning gains owed a lot to the economic data as well as continuing positive earnings news. Like most market watchers, he expected the US central bank to leave benchmark borrowing costs unchanged but was waiting for the Fed's accompanying statement. ""The Fed's language is going to be extremely important. They're going to have to address rising commodity prices, the improving economy and prospects for inflation rather than deflation,"" Mr Cardillo said. In the event, the Fed's statement said: ""The evidence ... confirms that spending is firming, and the labour market appears to be stabilising."" Its Federal Open Market Committee assessed the upside and downside risks in the economy to be evenly balanced. Investors took in figures showing increasing orders for durable goods in September as well as August, whose number was revised. In addition, a key gauge of consumer confidence rose in October by more than expected, reflecting the effects of an improving labour market and a rising equity market. Shortly after the announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 9,689.95, while the broader S&P 500 was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,038.55. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.4 per cent to 1,909.42. RJ Reynolds, which has agreed to buy British American Tobacco's US unit Brown &Williamson, reported a quarterly loss of $3.45bn, or $41.31 per share, down from a profit of $139m, or $1.56 per share, a year earlier as restructuring charges bit. But RJ Reynolds shares were up 11.9 per cent to $48.38 as investors welcomed news of the merger to create the second-biggest tobacco group in the US. Altria Group, owner of Philip Morris, saw its shares rise 1.5 per cent to $46 amid upbeat sentiment in the tobacco sector. Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor, reported that third-quarter earnings fell 25 per cent after a one-off debt charge.

295,2008-04-30,2008-05-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Overview: Investors heartened by US economic data.,"The dollar rebounded and Wall Street stocks staged a solid advance on Thursday as investors digested yet another batch of US economic data and attempted to decipher the implications of the Federal Reserve's rate cut and statement on Wednesday. However, activity was muted by the closure of much of continental Europe and Asia for public holidays. On Wednesday, the Fed cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2 per cent, but offered no clear direction about future rate moves. The remarks were viewed by many as oblique and triggered a welter of analyst comment. ""Given the market's reaction to the FOMC rate decision, it seems it really did not know what to do with it,"" said Rudy Narvas, senior analyst at 4Cast Economics. ""The statement . . . seemed to be a touch more dovish than the last, but kept the window of opportunity open enough for the Fed to offer policy easing if necessary."" Lena Komileva, G7 economist at Tullett Prebon, said the Fed had now taken the stance of an ""active observer"", against a backdrop of adverse developments taking place in real economic growth, financial markets and inflation. She added: ""A 2 per cent level for the Fed funds rate does not represent a natural end of this easing cycle."" But Dean Maki and Julian Callow at Barclays Capital took a different tack. ""We believe that this was the last Fed rate cut in this cycle and expect the Fed to keep rates on hold for most of the next year before raising them in early 2009,"" they said. The day's US economic releases appeared to back that view. Personal consumption grew by 0.4 per cent in March from the previous month, twice as much as expected, while manufacturing activity continued to contract in April but at a slower pace than had been feared. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for April came in at 48.6, unchanged on the month, against expectations that it would dip to 48. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. However, the employment component of the report dropped from 49.2 to 45.4, the lowest reading since May 2003. Concerns about the labour market had already been heightened by an unexpectedly large 35,000 increase in initial jobless claims in the latest week. The key US employment report for April is due out on Friday. Meanwhile, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation - the price index for core personal consumption expenditure - edged up 0.2 per cent for a year-on-year increase of 2.1 per cent - again slightly more than forecast. On the currency markets, expectations that US interest rates could be at - or at least close to - a bottom offered firm support to the dollar. The euro, by contrast, has been plagued by speculation that the deteriorating economic outlook for the eurozone will pressure the European Central Bank into lowering borrowing costs. However, Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, noted that the Fed's more sanguine outlook had come against a background of an improvement in market sentiment and said: ""This could also support the ECB's view that the eurozone can weather the storm, experiencing little more than the cyclical downturn which was already in the cards before the crisis hit,"" he said. The euro fell to a five-week low of $1.5438, while the dollar rose 1.1 per cent against the Swiss franc and also edged up against the yen. The dollar's rebound sent commodities prices sharply lower. Gold briefly fell below $850 an ounce to touch a four-month low. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark oil price, fell more than $2 a barrel to trade below $111. At the start of the week, WTI hit a record high just shy of $120 a barrel. Trading in equity markets was limited by holidays. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.6, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent. In London, the FTSE 100 index ended unchanged, while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.6 per cent. US government bonds were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 2 basis points to 3.71 per cent while the two-year yield was 2bp higher at 2.28 per cent. The 10-year UK Gilt yield fell 5bp to 4.62 per cent as falling commodity prices lessened inflation concerns."
296,2008-04-30,2008-05-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : US consumer struggles in face of inflation.,"US consumer spending rose more than expected in March but the bulk of the increase reflected higher costs for food and energy as real disposable income declined, a new report showed on Thursday. The economic headwinds facing consumers were also reflected in the latest report on the US labour market which registered the highest number of Americans on unemployment benefits in four years. Personal spending rose 0.4 per cent in the latest month, twice the rate forecast by economists and an improvement on the 0.1 per cent growth rate recorded the previous month. Incomes rose 0.3 per cent, roughly in line with economists' expectations after increasing by 0.5 per cent in March. Adjusted for inflation, real spending increased only 0.1 per cent, having stalled in February while inflation-adjusted disposable income fell by slightly less than 0.1 per cent. The core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflationary measure which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 per cent as expected, marking an increase of 2.1 per cent over the year, a fraction above the Fed's stated comfort level of 2 per cent. The US economy grew at a paltry 0.6 per cent rate in the first three months of this year as consumer spending slowed to a crawl and investment in capital goods and residential infrastructure contracted sharply. Real personal consumption expenditure increased at only a 1 per cent rate in the first quarter, the weakest growth rate since 2001 In its policy statement accompanying Wednesday's quarter point interest rate cut, the Federal Reserve again sounded a warning about the risks of inflation, emphasising that uncertainty about the outlook for rising prices remained high. ""Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months,"" the Federal Open Market Committee statement said. The Fed's statement was perceived by many economists to have been much more doveish than expected, drawing attention to ""subdued"" spending and labour market weakness. The number of Americans remaining on unemployment benefits rose to the highest level since 2004 as employers cut back on hiring amid an uncertain outlook for the US economy. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits jumped by 74,000 to 3.019m in the latest week while first-time jobless claims rose 35,000 to 380,000. The increase in initial claims was much greater than economists had forecast but this gauge tends to be volatile and fell by about the same amount the previous week. The four-week moving average, a smoother barometer of the labour market, declined from 370,250 to 363,750. Friday's closely-watched jobs report is expected to show that employers cut staff for a fourth consecutive month, to show an overall decline of 70,000 jobs in the labour market."
297,1999-12-21,1999-12-22,Financial Times,Y2K concerns hold down rates.,"The US Federal Reserve put its determination to ensure a smooth financial transition into the New Year ahead of concerns about the rapid pace of domestic economic growth and left interest rates unchanged yesterday. The central bank's policy-making federal open market committee (FOMC) left its key short-term interest rate, the fed funds target rate, at 5.5 per cent at its last meeting of the year. And, to underline its eagerness to prevent financial problems from the computer date changeover to the next century, the committee also said it was leaving its policy ""bias"", which indicates what the next move in rates might be, unchanged, at neutral. But the Fed hinted that this position was only temporary and indicated that, after the Y2K computer bug hurdle, concerns about the frenetic pace of domestic growth would dominate. ""Based on the available evidence the Committee remains concerned with the possibility that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance,"" it said. Most economists believe the Fed would probably have raised rates at its meeting yesterday were it not for lingering fears of financial disruption from the century date change. The Fed is committed to maintaining plentiful liquidity in case of funds shortages over the New Year period and an interest rate increase might have complicated that task. The central bank had been expected to signal a bias towards tightening at yesterday's meeting but policymakers were concerned that the possibility of a Y2K disruption, however small, required the central bank to adopt a more cautious approach. An increase still seems highly likely after the next FOMC meeting on February 2. Money market rates indicate investors are betting on at least a 0.5 percentage point increase in short-term rates over the first half of the year. There are scant signs of inflation in the US economy. In the year to November, core consumer prices rose by a meagre 2.1 per cent, a rate virtually unchanged over the last year. But Fed officials have expressed mounting concern in recent weeks that the rapid pace of US expansion in the last six months is not sustainable and will eventually produce an acceleration in wages and prices. In the three months to September, gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent. That pace has slowed a little in the final quarter of the year, but most private sector economic forecasts put the rate of growth at still above 4 per cent. Domestic demand growth is rattling along at an even faster pace - last month, for example, retail sales grew by 0.9 per cent from a month earlier. Even some formerly sceptical Fed officials acknowledge growing evidence that technological and structural changes have raised the economy's long-term potential rate of growth. But policymakers consider the pace too fast for inflationary comfort. The Fed has raised rates three times this year by a combined 0.75 percentage points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

299,1999-12-21,1999-12-22,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries modestly higher.,"US Treasuries posted only modest gains yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged in its last meeting of the year, and announced that it had no bias for future tightening of monetary policy. The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee did not make a statement until after European and Asian markets closed, causing Monday's dearth of trading activity to continue. With interest rates in the US, the UK and continental Europe expected to rise early next year, bond analysts from most institutions are predicting no end to the bear market until the second half of 2000. Investors are likely to avoid shorter-dated bonds where spreads will carry on widening, and instead focus on buying longer maturities. Apart from predictions on the outcome of the FOMC meeting, the market had little data to trade on. The firmer euro helped to support the bond markets, but liquidity did not recover from the low levels of the last week. In Frankfurt, the future on the 10-year German bund settled up 0.53 at 105.15. The future on the 10-year UK gilt rallied during the day but still ended the trading session down 0.1 at 112.70. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will release its final GDP and balance of payments figures for 1999 at 9.30am today, which could affect the performance of the gilt markets for the rest of the week. In midday trading on Wall Street, the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond was 5/32 higher at 96, pushing its yield down to 6.428 per cent. Similarly, the 10-year note gained 3/16 to 97 5/8, to yield 6.331 per cent, while the five-year note edged up 5/32 to 98 1/2 to yield 6.233 per cent. Saumil Parikh, analyst at Warburg, Dillon Read, said bond investors' restrained reaction to the news was appropriate. ""It's clear that the Fed is not entering the new year with a neutral bias. They highlighted all the same problems with the economy - namely the build up in supply and inflationary pressures,"" he noted. None of the leading dealers expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at yesterday's meeting, given the proximity of the millennium change-over and the accompanying fears about a lack of liquidity in financial markets. However, many predicted the body would shift to a bias for future tightening of monetary policy to bring a speeding US economy under control. The market has already priced in a 25 basis points increase in the Federal funds rate, which many believe will come at the FOMC's next meeting scheduled for early February. The economic board of Bond Market Association, a securities industries group with a broad Wall Street membership, has predicted two such increases next year that would lift the Fed funds rate to 6.00 per cent. Although headline economic data has yet to reveal any signs of inflation in the economy, those expectations have firmed in recent weeks with new reports that reveal its ongoing strength. Retail sales figures reported for November were almost double analysts' expectations when they were released last Tuesday, touching off a week-long slide in Treasury prices. Yields have since climbed above the 6.40 per cent level that had served as a recent ceiling. The yield on the 30-year benchmark at yesterday's close, 6.440 per cent, was its highest level since October 1997. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds futures firmed yesterday, with the March JGB up 0.12 to 132.22. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved. "
300,1989-11-14,1989-11-15,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Decline accelerates after car data,"Wall Street THE EQUITY market struggled to remain steady throughout yesterday's session, but finally buckled under the weight of weak economic data, a late downturn in the bond market and general apathy, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 16.18 points lower at 2,610.25 on sluggish volume of 143m shares. The index had closed 0.82 points higher on Monday at 2,626.43. Selling was encouraged in the afternoon, as the futures market reacted to early November car sales, which were the weakest for more than two years. For most of this year, the equity market has reacted positively to soft economic data, because of the hope of lower interest rates, but weak statistics are now regarded negatively. A substantial number of people in the market are worried about recession. The Dow rallied only briefly after the morning's economic reports. Industrial production fell 0.7 per cent in October, a much larger fall than expected. However, much of the drop was due to the Boeing strike and production disruptions after the California earthquake, particularly in the computer industry. The US Federal Reserve said production would have been little changed, had it not been for these special factors. Retail sales fell 1 per cent last month, in line with expectations based on already published weak statistics for car sales in October. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.2 per cent. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the Fed's target for Fed Funds, met yesterday and the central bank's open market operations were watched carefully. The Fed had been expected to drain reserves from the banking system, with Fed Funds trading some way below 8 1/2 per cent - believed to be the Fed's new target since its easing move last week. However, the Fed refrained from operating in the market when Fed Funds were trading at 8 3/8 per cent, suggesting to some a measure of tolerance for this level. It is difficult to tell exactly where the Fed wants Funds to trade on the basis of one day's market operation, however, and some felt the lack of operation was purely technical. This talk had little impact on equities, although late softness in long-dated Treasuries, after a weaker-than-expected 30-year auction, did undermine prices late in the afternoon. Among featured stocks was Microsoft, which dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 86 1/2 , reversing some of its Dollars 3 5/8 gain in over-the-counter trading on Monday. That advance had been on rumours of an agreement with IBM on a joint venture. Once this agreement had been announced late on Monday, traders started taking profits. IBM was unchanged at Dollars 98. Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 on expectations that Senator Ted Kennedy would introduce a Bill in Congress today which would impose stricter labelling requirements for cigarettes and take other measures to limit smoking. J C Penney added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 after reporting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.65 a share - better than analysts had expected. Longview Fibre rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 68 1/2 after the company said that it had raised its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent and planned a five-for-one stock split. MGM-UA Communications added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 21 on a US press report that Tele-Communications and its United Artist subsidiary might be putting together a bid for the company, possibly with Turner Broadcasting System. Mack Trucks fell Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 6 5/8 after the company reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 2.94 a share and said that it expected a substantial loss for the fourth quarter. Canada A SMALL loss came in moderate trading in Toronto, with golds the only sector to shine. The composite index lost 6.60 to 3,943.09 as declines outweighed advances by 344 to 293. Volume was 28m shares worth CDollars 309m. The gold stocks index gained 1.8 per cent, building on the previous day's 2.4 per cent climb, as the price of bullion continued to rise. Unicorp Canada A shares fell CDollars 3/4 to CDollars 5 3/4 after it announced a series of moves, including a CDollars 53.5m rights offering and a reduction in the annual dividend rate to 20 cents from 40 cents.

301,2007-03-21,2007-03-22,Financial Times,THE SHORT VIEW MARKET COMMENT BY JOHN AUTHERS.,"Cub journalists are taught that ""burying the lead"" is a cardinal sin. The most important news in a story must be in the first sentence, not buried at the bottom. The market response to yesterday's communique from the Federal Reserve's open market committee was that chairman Ben Bernanke had done exactly that. Had he?  On the surface, the statement - more important than the decision to keep the Fed Funds rate at 5.25 per cent, which was expected - is hawkish. Core inflation was ""somewhat elevated"" (in January, readings had ""improved modestly""). Inflation is now the FOMC's ""predominant concern"" (whereas in January it merely said ""some inflation risks remain""). That was balanced by the removal of January's reference to ""somewhat firmer economic growth"" - but there was nothing to signal an imminent rate cut.  Then came an innocuous final sentence: ""Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."" That is anodyne.After all, the Fed's remit isto limit inflation and foster employment. But previously, the Fed had referred to ""additional firming"" not the neutral ""policy adjustments"".  The market read this as removing the Fed's officialbias towards tightening, and therefore a signal that a rate cut is coming.  The dollar collapsed to two-year lows against the euro; bond yields shot downwards; and US stock indices rallied by about 2 per cent. Continuing the journalistic analogy: the invisible hand of the market acted like that of a good sub-editor and crossed out everything before the critical final sentence that no longer talked of additional firming. It also added a glaring headline: ""Rates are coming down"".  Bernanke may have been trying subtly to make room for manoeuvre - in case the debacle in subprime lending requires sharp easing - while maintaining in his inflation rhetoric an implicit bias towards tightening.  He probably did not wanta market response that would effectively ease monetary conditions. But markets arenot so subtle.  "
302,2007-03-21,2007-03-22,Financial Times,Decision by Fed on rates has tonic effect GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"US equities and Treasury bonds raced higher and the dollar retreated after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but removed a reference to ""additional firming"" in its post-FOMC meeting statement.  ""The Fed has not shifted toward balanced risks but it has taken one solid step away from a clear bias to tighten,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich CapitalGreenwich Capital Markets. In mid-afternoon trade in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up1.1 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 1.4 per cent.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was down 3.6 basis points while the dollar fell 0.4 per cent to Dollars 1.3370 against the euro.  But Rob Carnell, at ING, cautioned markets may be getting carried away. ""Whilst the amendment of the text on additional policy adjustments does perhaps take the Fed to a more neutral setting, the fact that inflation remains a problem means that we should not be rushing to forecast a bout of imminent rate cuts,"" he said.  The mood in equity markets was fairly positive even before the Fed published its statement. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 per cent amid continued optimism about the outlook for bid and merger activity.  Asian stocks were also broadly higher, despite the closure of Japanese markets for a public holiday.  Shanghai attained a record high, less than a month after the market's 9 per cent slide helped trigger a wave of market turmoil.  Hong Kong managed a 0.8 per cent rise and Mumbai increased by 2 per cent.  Kevin Gardiner, global head of equity strategy at HSBC, believed market nerves about corporate earnings growth and the unwinding of carry trades - where investors sell low-yielding currencies to fund positions in higher-yielding assets - were overblown.  ""We see equities more than recouping their recent losses and hitting new cycle highs by year-end,"" he said. ""We do worry about valuations in parts of the emerging market bloc and about short-term leverage across trading desks. But as equity strategists, we can't get exercised about the carry trade and we think that slower US earnings growth is effectively in the price.""  Bernd Meyer, at Deutsche Bank, noted recent equity market volatility had not spilled over to analysts' earnings estimates.  The FTSE 100 index in London attained a three-week high point.  "
303,2007-03-21,2007-03-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Opinion divided on rate message.,"Economists and interest rate strategists were divided on Thursday over whether the changes in Wednesday's Federal Reserve Open Market policy statement had opened the door to rate cuts.  ""The FOMC statement was tweaked to provide a new message whose meaning will be debated for days, if not weeks,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Although the FOMC warned that inflation might ""fail to moderate as expected,"" policymakers said ""future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth"".  This eliminated its previous reference to ""future tightenings"" and triggered a sharp rally on Wednesday afternoon in stocks and bonds, as traders speculated that the Fed had removed its official bias towards further tightening.  As attempts to analyse the Fed in more detail ensued, markets were more subdued on Thursday. The S&P 500 was flat after a 1.7 per cent surge on Wednesday. While bond prices were lower, the yield on the 10-year was at 4.59 per cent, above that of the two-year note's 4.57 per cent. The 10-year yield had been below the two-year yield since August of last year. Historically, when bond investors have believed the Fed would ease policy, the two-year yield has fallen below longer dated yields and resulted in a steeper yield curve.  ""The Fed's main concern is still inflation, but the new wording suggests an increased likelihood that their next move will be an easing rather than a tightening,"" said William O'Donnell, fixed income strategist at UBS.  Economists at Lehman Brothers emphasised the FOMC's concern over inflation. They said: ""Despite the small change in the boilerplate language, the remainder of the statement was either as hawkish as before or slightly more hawkish than expected. We do not view the change in language to 'future policy adjustments' as a set-up for near-term moves.""  Others said the statement had shown the FOMC was prepared to act should problems in the subprime mortgage market worsen and spill over.  Strategists at Credit Suisse said: ""Although the central bank said that its primary concern is over inflation, this change suggests that its reaction is, in fact, skewed to possible downside economic risks,"" and ""we see the re-steepening of the US curve and the weakening of the dollar as justified reactions.""

306,2001-08-21,2001-08-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),US leaders prepare for budget battle.,"US leaders were on Tuesday positioning themselves for the final battle over the budget in the autumn and with an eye to next year's congressional elections. President George W. Bush, speaking in Independence, Missouri - home of late President Harry Truman - said a budget report due out on Wednesday would show ""in plain terms"" that the shrinking US budget surplus was still large enough to protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and meet his priorities for education and defence. ""Our budget is in strong financial shape despite an economic slowdown that began last year,"" he said. Harry Truman, he said, had been ""a plainspoken fellow ... who brought a lot of wisdom to Washington"". Not coincidentally, perhaps, it is the image Mr Bush is seeking to project as he vacations at his Texas ranch for a month, flying to other US destinations for occasional speeches in which he refers to Washington DC as if it were a foreign country. But on Wednesday in Washington, the president's Office of Management and the Budget is to issue a mid-session budget review, containing estimates of the extent to which revenues have lagged behind projections made earlier this year. Preparing the ground for bad news, the president warned that ""inevitably, the slowing economy has resulted in slowing tax revenues, lower corporate profits and in some cases, layoffs"". But to loud applause, he said the federal budget would have the second-largest surplus in history ""because this administration took immediate action to address the downturn"". He did not mention that the surplus consisted almost entirely of Social Security funds. Democrats, who have launched their own assault on his tax and budget policies this week, were quick to respond. Gene Sperling, former Clinton economic adviser, noted in a telephone briefing on Tuesday that the Bush administration had originally tendered no plan to distribute tax returns this year, but had only agreed at the last minute to a Democratic proposal for economic stimulus. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, called the speech ""an exercise in public relations, pure and simple"". The OMB report would demonstrate that the tax cut had left no funds for other priorities. He went blamed the Bush tax cut for ""wiping out the surplus"" - although the only piece of it implemented so far is in the refund cheques proposed by the Democrats. The president, meanwhile, warned Congress to adhere to fiscal responsibility and not to attempt ""appropriation gamesmanship. I'm going to be watching carefully for the last-minute budget additions,"" he said. Mr Bush also said he would make sure Congress did not use the Social Security funds for the general budget, but to pay down $100bn of the US debt. The full text of the Federal Open Market Committee statement 'The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 per cent. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3 per cent. Today's action by the FOMC brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points. Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the US economy. The associated easing of pressures on labour and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained. Although long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favourable, the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.'.

309,2007-12-11,2007-12-12,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Full statement from Federal Reserve.,"""Today, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing measures designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. Federal Reserve Actions  Actions taken by the Federal Reserve include the establishment of a temporary Term Auction Facility (approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and the establishment of foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank (approved by the Federal Open Market Committee).  Under the Term Auction Facility (TAF) program, the Federal Reserve will auction term funds to depository institutions against the wide variety of collateral that can be used to secure loans at the discount window. All depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program will be eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All advances must be fully collateralized. By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations, this facility could help promote the efficient dissemination of liquidity when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress.  Each TAF auction will be for a fixed amount, with the rate determined by the auction process (subject to a minimum bid rate). The first TAF auction of $20 billion is scheduled for Monday, December 17, with settlement on Thursday, December 20; this auction will provide 28-day term funds, maturing Thursday, January 17, 2008. The second auction of up to $20 billion is scheduled for Thursday, December 20, with settlement on Thursday, December 27; this auction will provide 35-day funds, maturing Thursday, January 31, 2008. The third and fourth auctions will be held on January 14 and 28, with settlement on the following Thursdays. The amounts of those auctions will be determined in January. The Federal Reserve may conduct additional auctions in subsequent months, depending in part on evolving market conditions.  Depositories will submit bids through their local Reserve Banks. The minimum bid rate for the auctions will be established at the overnight indexed swap (OIS) rate corresponding to the maturity of the credit being auctioned. The OIS rate is a measure of market participants' expected average federal funds rate over the relevant term. The minimum rate for the December 17 auction along with other auction details will be announced on Friday, December 14. Noncompetitive tenders may be accepted beginning with the third auction. The results of the first auction will be announced at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on December 19. The schedule for releasing the results of later auctions will be determined subsequently. Detailed terms of the auction and summary auction results will be available at www.federalreserve.gov .  Experience gained under this temporary program will be helpful in assessing the potential usefulness of augmenting the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy tools--open market operations and the primary credit facility--with a permanent facility for auctioning term discount window credit. The Board anticipates that it would seek public comment on any proposal for a permanent term auction facility.  The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). These arrangements will provide dollars in amounts of up to $20 billion and $4 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively, for use in their jurisdictions. The FOMC approved these swap lines for a period of up to six months. Information on Related Actions Being Taken by Other Central  "

Shares had traded modestly higher before the Federal Open Market Committee's decision but dropped in afternoon trade after the Fed cut both the funds rate and the discount rate by a quarter percentage point.  Many analysts had expected a 50 basis point cut, particularly on the discount rate, to help alleviate severe liquidity problems in the banking sector and offset the worst effects of the credit squeeze.

But Goldman cut Starbucks to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", pointing to slower US same-store sales. The shares fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 22.20.  In economic news, the Commerce Department said inventories at US wholesalers were unchanged last month while sales rose 0.7 per cent.  "
313,2007-12-11,2007-12-12,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Action decided on in Cape Town.,"The co-ordinated central bank moves announced on Wednesday to prevent a meltdown in the world's banking system had their roots in last month's meeting of the world's largest 20 economies in Cape Town.  According to one European central bank, that was when central bank governors agreed that co-ordinated action, rather than a series of disparate moves in each country, was the way forward.  Central bankers wanted to avoid the risk that, by changing policy and devising new ways of providing liquidity, they could be accused of knowing something nasty about their own banking system.  Each central bank said on Wednesdat it had been working on ideas to help resolve liquidity issues at the height of the credit squeeze in August and September, but the urgency had diminished as the markets seemed to improve in late September.  As the situation deteriorated again last month, central banks put aside many of their differences and started talking in earnest about co-ordinated action. The decision to go ahead was taken in principle when they met at the G20 meeting in Cape Town. But it had to be secret, so a bland communique was issued.  The timing of the announcement was made difficult by concerns in some central banks that liquidity support operations should be distinct from monetary policy.  The US Federal Reserve's action in agreeing to lend dollars to the European Central Bank required the approval of the Federal Open Market Committee, so this had to come after the committee met on Tuesday. The ECB and the Bank of England are likely to have urged the Fed to delay the announcement because European central banks maintain a strict separation between official interest rate decisions and money market operations.

314,2007-12-11,2007-12-12,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall St rebounds as Fed pumps up liquidity.,"Wall Street stocks rebounded on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve unveiled a number of measures designed to alleviate money market funding pressures.  The Fed's announcement of a new auction facility and foreign exchange swap lines with other central banks cheered investors who had reacted with disappointment to a quarter-percentage point interest rate cut the previous day.  As interbank lending rates edged lower, stocks enjoyed a broad-based rally as hopes of improved global liquidity drove a bond market sell-off.  ""The market is focused on the fact that the Fed seems to be taking action,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said.  However, after an initial surge financials lost steam in spite of a policy announcement designed specifically to help them. Confidence waned after both Bank of America and Wachovia gave a disappointing outlooks. In the broader market equities failed to recover all the losses sustained after the Fed eased the previous day.  At midday the S&P 500 was up 1.3 per cent at 1,497.09, having earlier climbed as much as 2.3 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 2,695.19 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent higher at 13,560.96.  ""It seems this is what the markets were looking for yesterday [on Wednesday],"" Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said.  Stocks were hit hard on Tuesday after a 25bp rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee failed to appease nervous investors and calm fragile areas of the credit and mortgage markets.  Homebuilders suffered their sharpest ever one-day fall while financial companies also felt heavy selling pressure, falling 4.9 per cent.  The S&P financial index rose as much as 2.9 per cent on Wednesday but later traded flat at 405.64.  ""There is going to be a lot of liquidity but is this going to solve all the problems? I don't think so,"" Mr Cardillo said.  The sectors to benefit most from the Fed's move to tackle liquidity pressures were those that have typified the ""globalisation trade"" - energy, materials, industrials and technology.  Traders bet that any improvement in liquidity would see cash channelled towards companies perceived as having better exposure to overseas economic growth.  ""If this is the beginning of the end of the financial crisis, growth abroad will not be threatened and people will be piling onto the globalisation trade again,"" Mr Gendreau said.  The S&P energy index rose 2.9 per cent to 590.70 as crude oil prices climbed back above $90 a barrel. Exxon Mobil rose 2.8 per cent to $92.81 while Murphy Oil put on 4.3 per cent to $79.12. Goldman Sachs sharply raised its outlook for crude prices next year.  In the technology sector Microsoft, up 2 per cent to $34.78, Hewlett Packard, 3.4 per cent higher at $38.06 and IBM up 2.6 per cent at $109.76 were among the Dow's best performers on Wednesday.  In industrials Manitowoc, the diversified manufacturer, soared 9.7 per cent to $47.79 after it raised its 2008 earnings guidance. Cummins, the diesel engine and power generator manufacturer, gained 7.3 per cent to $126.86 after it announced a two-for-one stock split and $500m in share buybacks.  However, there was weakness in financials after Bank of America's chief executive warned the company's fourth quarter results would be ""disappointing,"" and said it would set aside $3.3bn to cover losses and writedowns. The shares fell 1.9 per cent to $43.82.  Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank, estimated its loan-loss provision for the fourth quarter at $1bn in excess of charge-offs, about double its previous forecast.  Merrill Lynch analysts downgraded Wachovia to ""sell"" as it expects credit losses to rise ""significantly"" next year.  Citigroup shares also lagged after a disappointing reception for newly appointed chief executive Vikram Pandit. The shares fell 4.3 per cent to $31.80 yesterday, and are down 10 per cent since the announcement.  Sallie Mae, the student loan company, slumped 9.1 per cent to $29.02 after it lowered its core earnings outlook and said a buyout consortium led by JC Flowers was unwilling to submit a new takeover proposal.

315,2007-12-11,2007-12-12,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall St set for rebound after Fed pumps up liquidity.,"Wall Street stocks were set for sharp rebound and bond yields were higher early on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve unveiled a number of measures designed to alleviate funding pressures.  ""Today, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing measures designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets,"" said the Federal Reserve.  The Fed will provide a new auction facility, and set up forex swap lines with the Bank Of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. The swap lines will enable these central banks to provide dollar loans and lessen money market pressures, particularly in the sterling and euro Libor markets.  The Fed's auctions will start on December 17 and involve the sale of $20bn in 28-day funds, followed by another $20bn on December 20 for 35 days. Two more auctions are scheduled for January 14 and 28. The new loans will be auctioned at a level linked to the expected actual fed funds over the loan's maturity.  On Wednesday, one-month Libor fell to 5.102 per cent from 5.02 per cent on Tuesday, but Libor was forecast to fall to around 4.95 per cent prior to the FOMC decision.  ""Certainly, a problem exists, as the one-month LIBOR reset 10bp lower this morning, but the spread to the Fed Funds target lies at 85bp, which..represents the most extreme disconnect since Y2K,"" said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Equity index futures surged on the news, and built on earlier gains as investors had expected new measures from the Fed.  Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were up 31.40 points at 1,509.50, up from 1,492.30 just prior to the Fed's announcement.  Nasdaq futures were up 37 points at 2,127 and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 225 points at 13,675.  Meanwhile, Treasury bonds suffered further losses and had more than reversed their sharp plunge in the wake of the FOMC meeting. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was up 22 basis points at 3.19 per cent and the 10-year Treasury note was 14 bp higher 4.13 per cent.  Stocks were hit hard on Tuesday, after a rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee failed to appease nervous investors and calm fragile areas of the credit and mortgage markets. As expected, the FOMC cut the Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent, but only lowered the discount rate by a quarter-percentage point to 4.75 per cent, rather than an expected 4.50 per cent.  ""The US financial markets clearly abhor a Fed that exudes a whiff of benign neglect at a time of great financial stress in the banking system,"" said William O'Donnell. strategist at UBS. In company news, financials gained in spite of downgrades from Merrill Lynch. Its analysts downgraded J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America to 'neutral' and Wachovia to 'sell' citing exposure to the subprime credit problems.  Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank, may allocate twice as much money for loan losses in the final quarter than it previously forecast. The bank said it would set aside $1bn in excess of charge-offs, an increase from the previous estimate of $500m to $600m. Its shares fell 2.3 per cent in pre-market trading.  Bank of America's chief executive on Wednesday said that the bank's results in the fourth quarter would be ""disappointing,"" citing expected writedowns and lower trading revenue.  In contrast, Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo led gains in the financial sector after the Financial Times reported, without citing anyone, that the Fed may announce a new system to auction loans to banks as early as Wednesday. Citigroups shares also rose in pre-market activity after the newly appointed CEO Vikram Pandit announced a thorough review of expenses and productivity.  AT&T management said they now expected the sales from online ads and searches to top $1.5bn by 2010, up from about $600m in 2007. Shares rose 2 per cent to $40.24 in pre-market trade.  Diversified manufacturer 3M said it expected double-digit sales and earnings growth in 2008 and gave earnings per shares forecast range that was above analysts' estimates.  Boeing fell 1.9 per cent in pre-market trading after Morgan Stanley downgraded the aircraft maker.  On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent to close at 1,477.65, after it was trading up 0.4 per cent before the FOMC meeting concluded. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.1 per cent to 13,432.77 - falling more than 360 points from its intraday high - while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.5 per cent to 2,652.35.  "
316,2007-12-11,2007-12-12,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Asian markets disappointed with Fed rate cut.,"Shares fell across the Asia Pacific region on Wednesday as investors seemed worried by the US Federal Reserve's statement that the US economy was slowing, and were concerned that its 25 basis point cut in interest rates may not be big enough to prevent a recession.  Hong Kong shares led the retreat, with the Hang Seng index falling as much as 3 per cent during the morning. Japanese shares lost their most in three weeks. Chinese shares also dropped sharply as inflation reached an 11-year high, raising fears that Beijing would have to tighten monetary policy.  David Cohen, head of Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore, said Asia's markets were moving in sympathy with Wall Street, where the S&P 500 index fell by 2.5 per cent overnight.  ""Hopes in Asia had got a little inflated ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting,"" Mr Cohen said. ""There's so much uncertainty overhanging the world at the moment. But so far the data in Asia have been reasonably encouraging.""  In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average was 1.8 per cent lower early in the afternoon trading session at 15,762.45. The broader Topix index lost 1.9 per cent to 1,538.06. Worries about a recession in the US - one of Japan's main markets - hit exporters, as did a fall in the dollar to Y110.63 from Y111.81 in late Tokyo trading on Tuesday.  Canon, the electronics company, dropped as much as 2.9 per cent to Y5,660 and the carmaker Honda Motor lost 2.8 per cent to Y3,780.  Similar worries beset investors in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng index was 2.6 per cent lower by the lunchtime break at 28,480.20. One of the biggest fallers was China Cosco Holdings, the container shipping line controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing. It dropped as much as 11 percent to HK$23.80 on news that it would sell an additional HK$2.2bn of shares. Cosco shares have risen fourfold this year.  China Shipping Container Lines sank by 10 per cent in Hong Kong to HK$5.74, but surged by 63 per cent to Rmb10.78 in Shanghai where it made its trading debut.  The company was one of the few to do well in mainland trading this morning. The Shanghai composite was down by 2 per cent to 5,070.38 by lunchtime and the Shenzhen composite dropped by 0.9 per cent 1,344.78.  "
317,2004-06-30,2004-07-01,Financial Times,Stronger Brazil seen as having little to fear.,"Two years ago, a tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve might have tipped the balance against Brazil's fight to stave off default. But yesterday there were few signs of distress in Brazil, the world's largest emerging-market debtor. The country's bonds rallied over the past month, and their yield over US treasuries narrowed by roughly 150 basis points. Investors had priced in a more benign scenario of gradual rate hikes by the Fed. With yesterday's confirmation, Brazil's financial markets could rally further. ""Brazil should be the big winner as investors realise that the FOMC will raise interest rates at a gradual pace,"" Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities, a Connecticut-based investment firm, said before the announcement. Conventional wisdom has it that higher interest rates in the US will drain capital from emerging markets, put pressure on their currencies, increase borrowing costs and even force a tightening of monetary policy. Brazil's central bank will now have less room to cut interest rates from the current level of 16 per cent. Leading financial institutions expect a cut of only 1 percentage point by the end of the year, down from forecasts in late March of 2 percentage points. But Brazil's economy is in a much stronger position to withstand more hostile capital market conditions than a few years ago. Economists have maintained economic growth forecasts of around 3.5 per cent and may even increase them. Brazil has cut external financing requirements dramatically. Exports grew by 40 per cent in 2003 and are up by an estimated 20 per cent this year. This has turned a current account deficit of 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 2001 into a surplus of roughly 0.8 per cent of GDP last year and 1.1 per cent of GDP this year. Foreign debt and exposure to currency volatility have fallen. ""The reliance of the Brazilian private sector on external markets has fallen sharply in the past few years,"" said JP Morgan, the investment bank, in a report last month. The corporate sector ""is well positioned to withstand a reduction in the availability of external credit lines, should that occur"", the bank added. Net foreign debt has fallen from 36 per cent of GDP in 2002 to an expected 26 per cent of GDP by year-end. The government also has reduced its dollar-linked domestic debt by Dollars 26bn to 16.6 per cent of its total public debt, from 37 per cent in December 2002. ""Brazil and emerging markets in general are in a much better situation than they were a few years ago,"" said Drausio Giacomelli, head of Latin American strategy at JP Morgan. ""Strategic demand for emerging market debt may slow but it won't unravel."" For regional reports, www.ft.com/usawww.ft.com/americas"
318,2004-06-30,2004-07-01,Financial Times,Rate rise signals the end of bonds bull run.,"For many on Wall Street, yesterday's interest rate rise served as a marker to the end of a 20-year-plus bull run for the bond markets. As interest rates have generally fallen since the early 1980s, bond prices have risen as the dividends they offer, or yields, fall in line with interest rates, providing rich capital returns for investors. But yesterday's move is widely forecast to have been the first in a series of rate rises that will push bond prices lower. Expectations of rate rises have already led the Dollars 3,000bn-plus (Euros 2,463bn, Pounds 1,651bn) US Treasury market to its worst quarterly returns in 24 years in the three months to June. ""You're not going to get the gains we saw before in bonds,"" said John Derrick, director of research at US Global Investors. ""There's a floor to how low rates and yields can go."" Despite the rout in bond prices over the last quarter, the markets had steadied in the run-up to the Fed's decision in the belief that future rate rises were largely now priced in to the market. Strategists and fund managers do not predict disaster, though they acknowledge returns will be lower. ""The Fed is most likely to tighten in baby steps,"" said Edward Marrinan, head of North American high grade strategy at JP Morgan. A decline in issuance - an indicator of market confidence - was related to strong corporate profits lessening the need for borrowing, he said. ""Given that Mr Greenspan has bent over backwards to telegraph the FOMC's intention to raise rates, I doubt many companies feel they will have missed the boat on borrowing."" Issuance for riskier high yield, or junk bonds, is up on last year and has risen recently as bond markets steadied. ""Investors are still showing a strong interest in taking on risk,"" said Kingman Penniman of KDP Investment Advisors. Investors have also pointed out that the historically low level of rates means an increase will still mean affordable borrowing. Citing the predicted end-of-year rate, James Kauffmann, head of fixed income at ING Investment Management, said: ""Fed funds at 2.25 per cent . But the low level of rates even after rises - which can take up to 18 months to feed into the economy - might fail to curb the recent pick-up in inflation. Unexpectedly strong inflation could force the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. This would push bond prices lower, and any uncertainty the extra rate rises created could weigh further on prices. ""The real concern is if the market prices in much more"" than 100 basis points this year, said Bill Kohli, bond fund manager at Putnam. Rising yields would force up interest rates on other products such as home loans, and could slow the economy. The good news for bond buyers is that research by ING Financial Markets shows that under Alan Greenspan's leadership of the Fed, the markets have historically overestimated the level of rates by almost a percentage point. The bad news is that the few periods when they have underestimated interest rates coincide with periods of rising rates. "
319,2004-06-30,2004-07-01,Financial Times,Federal Reserve delivers quarter point rise.,"The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point to 1.25 per cent yesterday, the first increase in more than four years. The move was expected after the Fed's efforts to prepare the ground for higher rates in recent weeks. But it kicks off what is likely to be a long tightening cycle fraught with risk, after a period in which households, businesses and investors have become used to cheap credit. The policymaking Federal open market committee sounded a slightly more hawkish tone in its accompanying statement. As expected, the Fed maintained its judgment that upside and downside risks to inflation remain balanced. It reiterated the committee's belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a ""measured"" pace, but added: ""Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfil its obligation to maintain price stability."" The FOMC acknowledged in its statement that incoming inflation data were ""somewhat elevated"" while adding that ""a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors"". Fed officials have been surprised by the sharp rise in inflation in the first half of the year - but expect a moderation in the second half. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and his colleagues have stressed that they would move more aggressively against inflation if their sanguine outlook proved to be incorrect. ""The baseline case is that it is likely the Fed will tighten at a measured pace, but now they have spelled out the risk case,"" said Paul McCulley, Fed-watcher at Pimco, the giant bond fund. A gradual approach to tightening rates will allow the US central bank to gauge the effect on consumer and business spending. Anything other than a quarter-point rate rise would have been a surprise, and there was little market reaction yesterday. Between the start of 2001 and last June, the Fed slashed interest rates from 6.5 per cent to 1 per cent - a 45-year low.

320,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,FED RATES CUT LEAVES DOW AT NEW RECORD - AMERICA.,"Wall Street US stocks continued their record breaking run yesterday as the widely expected interest rate cut came. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose nearly 110 points over the first two days of the week, failed to hold above the 5,400 level, closing at 5,395.30, up 14.09, writes Maggie Urry in New York. Share prices had been muted ahead of the decision from the Federal Open Market Committee, announced in the early afternoon, dropping nervously minutes before the news. Once the move had been made, though, equities rose again, the Dow reaching a peak of 5,408.67 before slipping back. The broader indices also rose, the Standard &Poor's 500 adding 5.87 at 636.02 and the American Stock Exchange composite gaining 3.14 at 554.10. The Nasdaq composite put on 8.49 at 1,059.79. Trading on the NYSE was active, volume reaching 475m shares. The rate cut had been widely expected and the reaction was muted. There was some concern that the Fed alluded to 'moderating economic expansion' as well as subdued inflation in making the cut. Cyclical stocks, which do badly when in a slowing economy, had been weak ahead of the rate reduction but fared better afterwards. Within the Dow's 30 shares, Caterpillar recouped a $1 1/4 fall to end unchanged at $64 3/8, Goodyear Tire and Rubber regained $1 of a $1 1/8 fall to close $1/8 off at $47 7/8, and International Paper ended down $5/8 at $40 7/8 after a low of $40 3/8. Earnings reports gave the market some impetus. Ford Motor beat expectations with fourth-quarter earnings per share of 49 cents, compared with forecasts of 21 cents. The stock rose at first, slipped and then recovered to end unchanged at $29 5/8. General Motors, at $52 5/8, retraced $1 of its $1 1/4 rise scored on Tuesday when it reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. Philip Morris, the tobacco and food group, pleased the market with fourth-quarter earnings per share slightly above forecast. However, after an initial rise, it lost $2 to $93 as analysts wondered what 1996 would bring. Kimberly-Clark, the paper maker which recently acquired rival Scott, took the opposite course. After reporting earnings below forecasts, the shares fell $3 1/2 to $76. However, they recovered sharply as analysts looked behind the headline figures, showing a gain on the day of $1 1/8 at $80 5/8. Also disappointing was Bethlehem Steel, which as well as producing fourth-quarter earnings below forecasts was cautious for the first quarter of the current year, saying price increases would not take effect until the second quarter. The shares softened $1/8 to $15 1/8. Corning shares were active on hopes that the diversified manufacturer might raise $1bn by selling its faltering laboratory services division. The stock rose $3/4 to $31 1/4. Topping the actives list were Hanson ADRs, following the Anglo-American group's decision to break itself into four new companies. The ADRs lost $1/4 at $15 1/2. Canada Toronto, unable to maintain its torrid pace of late, ended lower on profit-taking in the heavily weighted golds and financial services sectors. The TSE 300 composite index relinquished 19.44 at 4,968.43, while falls outscored rises by 446 to 435. Volume was 101.2m shares valued at C$1.30bn. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
321,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERS KEY US INTEREST RATES.,"The dollar rose on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rates by 1/4 percentage point. The Federal Reserve lowered its Federal Funds rate to 5.25% and its discount rate to 5.0%. The move was followed by the Bank of Canada, which reduced its key interest rates by a quarter-point. The prospect of fresh interest rate cuts had absorbed the attention of the foreign exchange markets throughout most of yesterday's European session, adding a note of uncertainty into trading. With the FOMC announcement coming after the close of European trading, the dollar consequently moved in a limited range for most of the European session. Meanwhile in Europe, the Bundesbank's decision to reduce the German repo rate - by 15 basis points to 3.4% - prompted speculation about further European interest rate cuts. Although the German currency was at first slightly dented by the move, it later recovered as the expectation grew that France and other European countries could follow suit. The Bundesbank's decision to reduce its repo rate did not take the markets by surprise: with growth in Germany having weakened markedly in recent months, most traders had already anticipated a small cut. However, the scale of the cut was slightly larger than the 10 basis points that most dealers had expected. It also fuelled speculation that the Bundesbank might follow the repo rate cut with a reduction in its discount or Lombard rate at its council meeting today. However, most dealers said they thought this was unlikely. They said the Bundesbank would probably wait in order to assess the impact of its last rate cut on M3, its measure of the money supply. But the German move was nevertheless thought likely to trigger further, slight easing elsewhere in Europe. Belgium, which ties its monetary policy closely to Germany, followed immediately: its central rate was reduced to 3.40% from 3.55% and its end-of-day rate to 4.65% from 4.80. The Netherlands is also widely expected to ease policy slightly today, when it sets its special advances pact. Meanwhile, the Bank of France, which also meets today, is expected to cut its own intervention rate by 20 basis points from its current level of 4.2%. Most European currencies were initially buoyed by the German repo rate cut before the D-Mark recovered later in the session. The Italian lira rose sharply to end near to its recent highs, while the French franc closed modestly up against the D-Mark. 'This environment where the Bundesbank is easing rates promotes more rapid growth across Europe and improves countries' chances of meeting the Maastricht criteria for monetary union,' said Mr Lawrence Hatheway, senior currency strategist at UBS in London. The lira found further support from the growing expectation that a new government would be formed soon. It was also supported by comments by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, who said the Italian currency had the potential to appreciate against other European currencies. Against the D-Mark, the lira closed higher at L1,071, from L1,074, and the French franc at FFr 3.433, from FFr 3.436. Traders said speculation of a small rate cut in France was likely to weaken the French franc in coming days. Trading in the dollar was subdued during most of the London session ahead of the FOMC meeting. Dealers said the markets had discounted a 25 basis-point reduction in US rates at the meeting. The Canadian dollar rallied strongly, buoyed partly by rumours of a large buy order in London and on speculation that Canadian rates would remain unchanged even if US rates were cut. In London the dollar ended at DM 1.4879, from DM 1.4900. It closed at Y 106.915 against the yen, from Y 107.2. It finished in New York at DM 1.4887 and Y 107.02. The pound finished slightly stronger against the D-Mark at DM 2.2482, from DM 2.2410. It was also ahead against the dollar, at $1.5110 from $1.5040. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
322,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - ENTHUSIASM FOR US RATE CUT SHORT-LIVED.,"US Treasury bonds jumped yesterday as the Federal Open Market Committee announced an interest rate cut at the end of its two-day meeting. However, the enthusiasm for the cut, announced in the early afternoon, was short-lived and bond prices fell back to end the day with modest gains. The dollar was little changed on the rate cut. The Fed reduced its target rate by a quarter of one percentage point to 5 1/4%, and the discount rate by the same amount to 5%. It cited moderating economic expansion and subdued inflation for its decision. Late in the day the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1/8 higher at 111 5/8 to yield 6.023%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note was up 1/8 at 100 1/8, yielding 4.917%. Bonds have been firm lately in anticipation of a cut, which came only six weeks after the previous reduction in December. It is the third easing of monetary policy by the Fed after the tightening begun in early 1994. While many economists welcomed the reduction in interest rates, Mr Ken Bercuson, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said: 'I think it is a mistake they will live to regret.' He expected inflation to rise to around 4% and said the Fed might have to raise rates again later in the year. The market was also weighed down by news that next week's Treasury auctions will be the biggest on record, raising $44.5bn of which $13.2bn will be new cash. The sale will comprise $18.5bn of three-year notes, $14bn of 10-year notes and $12bn of 30-year bonds. Before the auction can go ahead the Treasury must put in place measures to avoid breaching the $4,900bn debt ceiling. In Germany, meanwhile, bonds closed lower despite a 15 basis point cut in the German repo rate to 3.4%. Traders attributed the fall to profit-taking, said to be by hedge funds, and technical trading. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns International, said the markets had been 'whip-sawed between interest rate expectations on both sides of the Atlantic'. Investors were waiting for the outcome of the Bundesbank council meeting today. Mr Brown said: 'With the Bundesbank accelerating its pace of repo easing, from 8, to 10, to 15 basis points off rates, we reckon the chances of a discount rate cut tomorrow have improved from 55:45 in favour to 65:35 in favour.' Mr Karl Haeling of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt said the size of the cut had led to a reassessment of German rates by some investors. He said: 'Rightly or wrongly, people are perceiving that the end of the interest rate fantasy is nearly on us. Some are saying that interest rate cuts are so widely anticipated that they can only provide disappointment when they come.' The yield on benchmark two-year paper increased 1 basis point and that on 10-year paper by 2 points, with the spread between the two maturities settling at 224 points. On Liffe the March 10-year bund future closed at 100.27, down 0.21. At the London close, the yield spread of 10-year bunds over Treasuries was up from 17 to 22 basis points. French government bonds were lifted by poor unemployment data and the March Notionnel future on Matif closed up 0.10 at 122.88. Hopes of an imminent cut in the intervention rate buoyed the short end of the curve, and yields on two-year paper fell 6 basis points while yields on the 10-year area rose 2 points with the spread between the two maturities at 193. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, said more steepening could lead the French yield curve to steepen to German levels, where the two to 10-year spread is around 220 points. The spread over bunds tightened 2 basis points to 47 points. Italian bonds followed bunds, and the March bond future on Liffe closed up 0.45 at 112.40 but surged in late afternoon when a resolution of the political crisis was believed to be nearer. The spread over 10-year bunds narrowed 8 basis points to 432. UK government bonds were dragged down by a disappointing gilt auction. Although the auction cover was 1.96 times and the tail was 2 basis points, the lowest accepted price was 5/32 below the pre-auction market level at 105, where it yielded 6.76%. A trader said: 'People don't necessarily want the stock but they are happy to take it on at these levels.' Mr Andrew Roberts, analyst at UBS, said the result was a disappointment because 'the gilt market offers more value than any other European market just now'. On Liffe the March long gilt future closed at 110 7/16, down 7/16. The 10-year yield spread over Germany moved from 169 to 173 basis points. On two-year paper yields rose 3 points and on 10-year paper by 5 points, with the spread between the maturities at 124 basis points. The yield spread of 10-year Swedish government bonds over bunds narrowed by 6 basis points to 242 points on hopes of further repo rate cuts from the Riksbank. Ms Wike Groenenberg, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said 20 or 25 basis points could come off the repo rate within two weeks. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
323,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,MARKETS - JANUARY ENDS WITH NEW FRANKFURT PEAK - EUROPE.,"Another aggressive repo rate cut, 15 basis points, saw FRANKFURT set an emphatic new high on the session. It closed official business with the Dax at 2,470.14, wobbled in the afternoon as the dollar, bonds and the Dow moved against it, and ended Ibis trading with a 6.91 gain at 2,463.00. Turnover rose from DM 11.1bn to DM 13.4bn; Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens traded in DM 4.4bn between them. Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf calculated that the official close left the Dax up 9.6% on the month, compared with a 7% gain for the whole of 1995. The market, said Mr Frahm, was being driven by the dollar and corporate restructuring prospects, as well as by liquidity and the interest rate environment. DAX 30 earnings per share were expected to rise by 30% this year, and by 13% in 1997, and dollar-related stocks dominated the best Dax performers in January, led by Continental, Bayer and BMW, up 21.5, 17.6 and 15.1% respectively. Lufthansa rose another DM 5.80 yesterday to DM 223.80; the flag airline told a German business magazine on Sunday that it could treble its earnings by the year 2,000. SAP prefs dropped DM 9.70 or 4.3% to DM 217.50 after a 44% rise in 1995 earnings, and confident predictions for 1996. PARIS, down at one point, rose for the sixth consecutive session on late foreign buying, the CAC-40 index ending 17.90 higher at 2,021.03, with turnover inflated to FFr 7.23bn by expiry-related arbitrage. Stocks which got a poor early reception improved. Bouygues, after its news of heavy provisions against the 1995 accounts, fell to FFr 492.50 before closing a net FFr 15 down at FFr 517; L'Oreal, relatively flat in its initial reaction to higher turnover and profits for 1995, ended FFr 19 ahead at FFr 1,448. Meanwhile, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, outdistanced most blue chips with a gain of FFr 4 at FFr 119, on higher earnings and plans to sell FFr 10bn of assets to reduce debt. MILAN built up its hopes for an imminent solution to the government crisis. The Comit index rose 6.17 to 619.94, while the real-time Mibtel index was 82 higher at 9,923. Stet forged ahead L224 to L4,971 after newspaper reports that the group's assets might be sold in tranches, although many analysts were sceptical about the practicalities of such an operation. Fiat was weak after its recent spurt, awaiting Mr Gianni Agnelli's last annual letter to shareholders as chairman, which came after the market closed. The shares fell L65 to L5,334. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International described the 1995 results as 'acceptable but nothing special', adding that the company was capable of significantly more. ZURICH continued higher, supported by a steady dollar, but activity was thin as many investors awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index rose 11.9 to 3,248.7. Bank Baer, which released 1995 figures, picked up SwFr 30 to SwFr 1,260. Registered shares in Elco Looser, the heating equipment manufacturer, which closed at SwFr 491 on Tuesday, were suspended throughout yesterday's session ahead of the SwFr 535 a share bid from Preussag, the German engineering group. MADRID featured a near 3% gain in Repsol, up Pta125 at Pta4,360, on signs that the latest privatisation offer was being well absorbed. The general index rose 27.40 to 3,734.49. BRUSSELS liked a 15 basis-point cut in the Belgian National Bank's central rate, and the Bel-20 index put on 14.56 at 1,690.23. Forestries, with sector indices up 2.7 and 2.3% respectively, lifted HELSINKI, where the Hex index rose 12.50 to 1,752.41, and STOCKHOLM, where the Affarsvarlden General index closed 16.1 better at 1,765.1. However, the Swedes also enjoyed a 1.6% lift in the drugs sector, where Astra rose SKr5 to SKr282, and Pharmacia &Upjohn also by SKr5, to SKr282.50, after overnight sector gains in the US. ISTANBUL leapt 6.9% as Turkey and Greece withdrew from a disputed rocky outcrop in the Aegean Sea after a tense stand-off on Tuesday. The IMKB-100 index gained 3,210 at 49,489.5. Analysts noted, however, that the market remained sensitive to domestic politics over efforts to form a coalition government after the inconclusive December elections. ATHENS also reacted to the de-escalation of tension, with a 1.6% rise. The general index moved up 15.08 to 989.45. WARSAW picked up 2.4%, taking the month's advance to 30% and the market to a 52-week high. The Wig index rose 241.6 to 10,413.1 on hopes that the year's second interest rate cut could come as soon as February. Animex, the food processor, jumped 2.70 zlotys to 29.80 on news that it would receive a 19m-zloty refund after paying too much tax in 1990. BUDAPEST was higher for the 13th successive session and the Bux index climbed 65.26 to 2,068.06. Bearer shares in Agrimpex, the agricultural trading company, soared Ft1,500 to Ft13,000 as the group established a subsidiary intended to centralise its trading activity.

325,1990-08-21,1990-08-22,Financial Times,Government Bonds: Japanese bond futures collapse to historic low,"JAPANESE bond futures prices collapsed yesterday to reach a historical low as a combination of concerns about the Gulf crisis and hedging orders before today's 10-year bond auction pushed prices lower. The December Tokyo futures contract tumbled to 89.77 from Monday's close of 90.16 as volume surged to over 60,000 lots. Cash bond prices were not affected as much by the weakness and yields on the 119 benchmark bond remained just over 8 per cent in a volatile day as the Ministry of Finance supported the market for the second day running by buying bonds. Futures traders were taking positions in the market in advance of the MoF's auction today of Y800bn of 10-year bonds which are expected to carry a coupon of 7.3 per cent. However, the auction is expected to be greeted with little retail demand. Some American banks have indicated that they have few investors willing to buy the new issue of Japanese bonds at a coupon of less than 7.5 per cent. Brokers are selling futures contracts to hedge the holdings of cash bonds they expect to acquire today. This forced futures prices lower. WEST GERMAN bond yields remained firmly above 9 per cent yesterday for the first time since May, as the market is still dominated by inflation concerns and worries about the Gulf. IN THE UK, gilt-edged securities eased upwards in a belated reaction to Monday's money supply figures which were favourable for the market, but failed to impress it initially. A benchmark bond maturing in 2003/07 rose to 98 3/16 from Monday's close of 97 7/8 . US Treasury bonds recovered from early losses of around 1/2 point on rumours that a US fighter aircraft had been shot down in the Gulf and that the July budget deficit would be larger than expected, neither of which were true, to end marginally lower.

326,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - BUY PROGRAMME DRIVES FOOTSIE THROUGH 3,100 - MARKET REPORT.","It was virtually all good news yesterday for a London stock market celebrating a series of specialist deals, including a #500m share buy-back by one of the leading FT-SE 100 stocks, a huge buy programme, a highly successful bought deal and a series of excellent company news items. Added to that heady cocktail was another strong performance by Wall Street, which gained ground shortly after the opening yesterday ahead of the outcome of the crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Wall Street shrugged aside another batch of economic data from the US indicating strong growth in the economy. At the close of trading, and with no news from the FOMC meeting available to the market, the FT-SE 100 Index fulfilled recent market optimism, sweeping confidently through the 3,100 barrier and closing a net 40.1 higher at 3,135.4. Second-line stocks shared in the buoyant mood of the market, the FT-SE Mid 250 ending 22.6 stronger at 3,560.7. And there was a general air of optimism around City trading desks, with dealers adopting the view that, within reason, the UK market would take whatever was thrown at it by the Federal Reserve. 'If we get 50 basis points, the market will say it is already in the prices; if we get 75 or even 100 points, the bond market will love it and we will hang on to their coat tails,' was the view of one top trader in London, although he cautioned that the market would definitely not appreciate an absence of movement by the Federal Reserve. The rate rise of 3/4 percentage point was subsequently announced. The overall bullish view was reinforced by a surge of activity in derivatives markets, where turnover was said to have been the heaviest since mid-September. Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session to reach 961.4m shares, the highest seen for many weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for an unusually low 39% of the total. Dealers picked up the scent of a big market operation before the opening and prices across the board were marked better at the outset, when the FT-SE 100 was around 10 points ahead. News that Boots had sent its broker SG Warburg into the market to buy in around 10% of its shares drove Boots sharply higher until the buy-back operation was satisfied. Boots' move came 24 hours after it sold its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals company. At the same time, AMP Australia, the life assurance group, sold its 3.2% holding in Hammerson to Smith New Court, the UK securities house, who quickly placed the stock in the market, taking a 3p a share turn in the process. While these deals were being unwound, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, moved in to execute a #160m-plus buy programme, spanning the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices. These three big operations accounted for more than 270m shares, or 28% of turnover in the market yesterday. At its best, just before the close, the FT-SE 100 was more than 42 points up, with dealers reporting only light profit-taking towards the close. Company trading reports provided numerous features, including De La Rue, the banknote printing group, whose shares sprinted to an all-time high after excellent results, while PowerGen fulfilled even the most optimistic dividend forecasts. General Accident was the one real disappointment in the market as the steep fall in the insurance group's net asset value, and middle of the range third-quarter profits, left the market unimpressed. The best performance among the FT-SE 100 stocks came from Standard Chartered, viewed by many chartists as in the initial stages of a big upside break; dealers noted heavy turnover in Standard shares.

327,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - SHORT-LIVED RALLY IN US TREASURIES AFTER RATE RISE.,"US Treasury prices were extremely volatile yesterday afternoon as the market struggled to interpret the implications of the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would increase the target for its Federal funds rate. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 7/32 at 93 23/32, yielding 8.047%. At the short end of the market the two-year note fell 1/8 to 99 19/32, to yield 7.081%. The long-bond yield fell below 8% immediately after the announcement that the Fed's open market committee had voted to boost the target rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2%. Most analysts had expected an increase of at least 50 points and believed the markets had already accounted for a 50-point increase. The news that the Fed had increased the target rate by more than expected was taken as a sign that it was willing to continue a tough stance against inflation. But the rally was short-lived. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, said the initial rally was more surprising than its later return to near pre-announcement level. 'A move of this magnitude had certainly been contemplated by most market players,' he said. 'There is ample justification for the market to be somewhat better than pre-announcement levels because the Fed has shown more anti-inflation resolve than previously,' Mr Lipsky said. 'There is little justification for any significant rally at this time because, until economic growth shows clear signs of deceleration, the bond market remains vulnerable to disappointing inflation figures,' he added. The Fed cited the highest capacity utilisation figures since February 1980 as its main reason for the increase. Earlier, it had announced that the economy was using 84.8% of its capital stock for the production of goods, and a 0.7% increase in industrial production. Economists had anticipated a 0.6% increase in industrial production and capacity utilisation of about 84.8%, but the actual figures were considered generally in line with expectations. Bond prices dipped early in the morning following the announcement that retail spending for October had grown by 1.1% - analysts had expected an increase of about 0.6% - but bounced back later in light trading as traders awaited an announcement on interest rate policy. European government bond markets drifted higher yesterday as investors waited for the result of the Federal Reserve meeting in the US. Mr Simon Maggs of IBJ in London said: 'Trading has been very thin ahead of the FOMC meeting, but European markets will be moving on the back of that meeting tomorrow.' Most markets followed German government bonds upwards, although Italy registered a fall as investors took stock of the difficulties the government is having in enacting budgetary reforms. German bunds broke through an important resistance point at 90.50 and the December bund futures contract ended at 90.69, up 0.41 on the day, in light trading. Mr Karl Haeling at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said: 'Breaking through that point makes it very tempting to get bearish.' However, he pointed out that if there were a rally in bunds, investors were likely to shift into US Treasuries. UK government bonds followed bunds up in thin trading and the December long gilt future closed around 102 1/8, up 13/32. The yield spread over bunds was 135 basis points. A #250m tranche of 8 3/4% Treasury stock due 2017 was exhausted in afternoon trading. The bonds were supplied at 102.28, the Bank of England said. The tranche was one of four tap stocks announced on November 4. Two others, a #250m tranche of 8 1/2% stock due 2005 and #100m of 2 1/2% index-linked stock due 2000 have already been exhausted. Another #100m tranche of 2 1/2% gilts due 2024 has not been sold out. While the sale of the tranche suggested demand for gilts, some analysts believed the bonds had been bought by market-makers and would continue to hang over the market until sold on to investors. A raft of UK data is due out this morning, encompassing figures on government borrowing, inflation, employment and wages, as well as the minutes of the September 26 monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond rose by 4 basis points to 11.91%. Mr Adrian James at NatWest said this was due to worries over budgetary change. 'Clearly the populace is unhappy about the pension reform,' he said. The yield on the benchmark 11-year Swedish bond fell to 10.84% from 10.88%. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the markets 'believe the honeymoon is over for Swedish bonds'. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
328,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,FED RAISES US SHORT-TERM RATES BY 3/4 OF A POINT.,"The US Federal Reserve surprised the financial markets yesterday with an increase of three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term interest rates intended to keep inflation under control. The increase is the largest adjustment the Fed has made under the chairmanship of Mr Alan Greenspan, who has preferred more gradual changes in monetary policy, and responds to what the Fed called 'evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. The size of the increase unsettled Wall Street, which had expected the Fed to raise short-term rates by only half a percentage point. Share and bond prices immediately jumped sharply as the markets applauded the central bank's resolve to fight inflation. But they later retreated as investors worried that the Fed's comments about its concern at the strength of the economy suggested it might raise rates again soon. By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which fluctuated wildly all afternoon - was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The bond market held its modest gains, which pushed the yield on the long bond down slightly to 8.047%. Currency markets, however, reacted unequivocally to the Fed's move, with the dollar rising a pfennig to DM 1.555 and half a yen to Y 98.7. The dollar opened in Tokyo at Y 98.61 and DM 1.5565. 'The Federal Reserve views these actions as necessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said after its federal open markets committee, which sets interest rate policy, met yesterday. The move is the sixth interest rate increase this year, and takes the federal funds rate, which banks pay when they borrow from each other's reserves held at the Fed, to 5.5% from 3.0% at the beginning of the year. The discount rate, which banks pay for direct borrowings from the Fed, also started the year at 3% but has risen only to 4.75%. Many commercial banks immediately followed suit, lifting their prime rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 8.5%. Financial market traders and economists have been beseeching the Fed to act decisively to slow economic activity. But the Fed has not moved rates by more than half a percentage point in either direction since 1981. When the FOMC last met in September, it decided to leave rates unchanged, in spite of the growing conviction of Wall Street economists that another move would be needed. Economic data available at the time of the September meeting showed that US gross domestic product had grown at a 3.8% annualised pace in the second quarter, the unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.1% and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity. Since then, second-quarter growth has been revised up to 4.1%, with the third quarter still humming along at a 3.4% rate; unemployment has dipped to 5.8% and the NAPM index has risen sharply for the past two months. Industrial production figures yesterday added to the picture of 'persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "

The index closed 130.23 up at 19,391.68 after fluctuating in a narrow range between 19,432.59 and 19,314.76. Brokerage dealers and domestic institutions purchased shares, but foreign investors turned net sellers. Sentiment stayed subdued, with many investors remaining cautious ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and volume eased from 229m shares to 219m. The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 10.82 to 1,528.64 and the Nikkei 300 moved forward 2.10 to 280.80, while rises outnumbered falls by 738 to 219, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.06 to 1,259.44. Traders said speculative investors, discouraged by the low volatility in the first section, explored the second section and the over-the-counter market. A branch manager at Nikko Securities said he would recommend that clients focus on small-capitalisation stocks on the second section and in the OTC market backed by strong earnings growth. The second section index climbed 35.25 or 1.7% to 2,147.11. Privatisation issues, which had been battered by recent profit-taking, staged a rally. Reports that the government had abandoned the plan to list West Japan Railways in the current fiscal year cheered market participants. Japan Tobacco recouped Y 30,000 at Y 991,000 on buying by corporate investors, breaking out after six straight sessions of decline. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y 12,000 at Y 876,000. Brokers, which have been hurt by the recent drop in the stock market, advanced. Nomura Securities rose Y 60 to Y 1,930 and Nikko Securities Y 30 to Y 1,030. Steels and shipbuilders were actively traded but finished mixed. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, moved up Y 3 to Y 385 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries added Y 9 at Y 749. NKK dipped Y 4 to Y 276. High-technology stocks were firm. NEC improved Y 20 to Y 1,180 and Hitachi Y 4 to Y 974. Sony rose Y 30 to Y 5,780, but Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y 10 to Y 1,530 in spite of strong consolidated earnings growth. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 143.89 at 21,437.47 in volume of 58m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, rose Y 120 to Y 2,420. Roundup Senior markets, in particular, were inspired by Wall Street's overnight gains and prospects following an expected rise in US interest rates. Jakarta, hosting the APEC summit, was closed for the second day in succession before reopening today. HONG KONG rose 2%, the Hang Seng index climbing 186.74 to 9,565.66 and turn-over more than doubling to HKDollars 3.91bn from Monday's four-month low of HKDollars 1.78bn. However, the view remained that the US situation offered trading, rather than investment, potential. Concerns over US inflation data and rates trends over the longer term were expected to linger after the US credit tightening move widely expected yesterday. Recently weak banks and property shares attracted the most attention, with HSBC, the most active stock, appreciating HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 91.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.25 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 49.90. KUALA LUMPUR reported strong retail and institutional buying as the KLSE index rose 25.43 or 2.4% to 1,069.74, its largest single-day gain in more than three months. Volume swelled to 299m shares, its highest in four weeks, from Monday's 132m. Brokers said the market had factored in a 50 basis-point increase in US interest rates, but that a larger rise could put some pressure on the market. Meanwhile, Baring Securities market strategist Mr Alan Butler-Henderson said in his Tiger Talk monthly that the Malaysian market would have the 'best bounce' after any US interest rate increase. BANGKOK surged as the market finally discounted expectations of a rise in US interest rates, and the SET index closed 19.01 better at 1,496.85 in heavy turnover of Bt8.69bn. Buying interest emerged initially in the finance sector, and spilled over to some property issues. SINGAPORE ended off intraday highs, the Straits Times Industrial index finally standing 14.24 up at 2,341.18. Foreign held bank shares were firm, Overseas Union Bank foreign gaining 25 cents at S$8.75, United Overseas Bank foreign 20 cents at S$16.30 and Overseas Chinese Bank foreign 50 cents at S$15.80. WELLINGTON was led down by forestry stocks Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey as the NZSE-40 index retreated 11.98 to 2,042.63. Fletcher finished 14 cents off at NZ$4.12 after some forecasters downgraded their expectations, and Carter slipped 6 cents to NZ$3.78 in sympathy. Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three British Columbia pulp and paper mills voted on Monday in favour of strike action over working conditions, which would not have helped the stock's tone, said brokers. SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index rallied 15.0 to 1,941.4, with brokers noting bargain hunting in resource stocks following the heavy selling in this sector in the previous few days. Among the day's best performers, BHP moved ahead 20 cents to A$19.10, CRA 18 cents to A$17.84 and MIM 6 cents to A$2.54. In the media section, News Corp was down 4 cents at A$5.34 after losing an early gain, but Fairfax advanced 12 cents to A$2.72. KARACHI sagged at the close as market sentiment remained depressed by fears of ethnic violence in Karachi, political uncertainty and shortage of funds. The KSE 100-share index fell 18.67 or 0.9% to 2,178.91. SHANGHAI's A share index declined sharply after Beijing denied reports that it planned to allow pension funds to be invested in the domestic market. The index dropped 29.8 or 3.9% to a day's low of 724.55. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
330,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - S AFRICA ENDS MILDLY FIRMER.,"Shares in Johannesburg registered mild gains, with trading seen to improve late in the day after a lethargic morning session. Brokers remarked that turnover had been slow before rising towards the close, although individual share price movements had been restricted by the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting. One of the features was a rise in the price of bullion, which lifted the golds index a modest 4 points to 2,168, a gain matched by the overall index, which closed at 5,865 after trading in a narrow 10-point range throughout the session. Industrials showed the best performance, advancing 14 to 6,808. Among the most heavily traded stocks yesterday, De Beers recovered from a softer start to finish unchanged at R99.75 and Anglos was 50 cents better at R243.50. Elsewhere, Gencor put on 5 cents at R15.20, Minorco relinquished 50 cents to R107.50 and Richemont softened 25 cents to R38.50. CG Smith, the industrial group, lost 50 cents at R18.25 in spite of the release of year-end figures showing earnings up by 13% to 106 cents. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
331,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL BONDS - ITALY ANNOUNCES TERMS OF Y 450BN EUROYEN OFFERING.,"The Republic of Italy's long-awaited euroyen offering will consist of three tranches, of Y 125bn of three-year, Y 200bn of 10-year and Y 125bn of 20-year bonds, the Italian Treasury said last night. The three-year tranche is likely to carry a coupon of 3 7/8%, the 10-year tranche a coupon of 5.0% and the 20-year tranche a coupon of 5.5%, market sources said. The deal, due to be launched early this morning, will be lead-managed by Daiwa, with Nomura as joint book-runner on the three and 20-year tranches. The three-year tranche is targeted mainly at Japanese retail investors, while the 20-year tranche hopes to find demand among Japanese institutional investors, Daiwa said. Daiwa hopes that the 10-year tranche will excite some interest among Asian investors outside Japan and among European investors. The offering, the third time Italy has tapped the yen market this year, is likely to complete its foreign borrowing programme for 1994. The Hellenic Republic is also rumoured to be close to launching its global dollar offering, which is expected to focus on the five-year area. Joint-lead manager Salomon Brothers was last night unable to comment on the size and terms of the offering. With market attention occupied by the outcome of the US Federal open market committee meeting and by a series of new US economic statistics, there was little new issuance in the eurobond market yesterday. In the Dutch guider sector, Asfinag, the sovereign Austrian financing authority, launched a Fl 300m offering of eight-year bonds, priced to yield 20 basis points over Dutch government bonds. About Fl 150m of the offering was bought by Dutch institutions, lead manager ABN Amro said, with Belgian retail investors also showing some interest. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Austrian schillings. In the dollar sector, Sampo Corporation launched a $50m offering of seven-year bonds offering a coupon of 2.75% and callable after five years. Japan's Electric Power Development Company is rumoured to be poised to tap the dollar sector with a $300m offering of five-year bonds, IBJ is said to have the mandate to lead the deal. In the Luxembourg francs sector, the Republic of Portugal launched a LFr2bn offering of bonds due January 2005, lead-managed by Kredietbank. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
332,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,FED LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED.,"Fed leaves interest rates unchanged: The Federal Open Market Committee ended its monthly meeting with no change to interest rates.

333,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,US STOCKS EDGE UP AFTER RATE MEETING.,"AMERICA: Wall Street The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to edge ahead yesterday in very light trading after the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee left US interest rates unchanged, writes Richard Waters. Wall Street had already come to the view that the Federal Open Market Committee would elect not to raise rates, but yesterday's news still lent support to the more interest-rate sensitive stocks among the Dow's 30 constituents. The index of leading stocks continued where it had left off on Monday, a day which had seen the second-lowest trading volume of the year so far. By the end of the day, the Dow was at 5,721.26, up 21.86 from the previous close. That brought its total gains in the past five sessions to more than 70 points. The broader Standard &Poor's 500, meanwhile, lost ground, falling back 0.89 to 665.69, while the Nadsaq composite eased 6.24 to 1,124.67. The Dow's advance was driven largely by gains among companies whose earnings are most directly tied to the economic cycle, reflecting a belief that interest rates are unlikely to rise until late in the year, if then. Among the biggest movers, Alcoa rose $1 3/8 to $63 1/8, a rise of 2.2%, while Caterpillar was up $1, or 1.4%, at $71 3/8 and Du Pont rose $1 5/8 to $83 5/8. AT&T, which had been the biggest decliner among the 30 shares in the Dow index on Monday, recovered some of its lost ground, adding $1/8 to $54 1/4. That repaired some of the damage done by the departure of its highly regarded president, Mr Alex Mandl, who has left to join Associated Communications, a new wireless telecommunications company. Shares in Associated Group, that company's main shareholder, advanced further yesterday, adding another $2 to $32 1/4 after the $4 3/4 gain on Monday. AT&T's shares remain some 10% below their level of early July, when the company reported disappointing second quarter earnings. Another Dow stock to record solid gains was Philip Morris, which registered a further partial rebound from the sharp drop precipitated by an adverse court ruling 12 days ago. The company rose $1 5/8, or 1.8%, to $91 1/2. The Nasdaq slipped on a fall among some of the biggest stocks traded on the market, among them Intel, which slipped $1 1/4 to $79 1/2 and Cisco Sytems, which fell $1 to $55.

334,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,COVENTRY BUILDING SOCIETY MAKES A RARE APPEARANCE.,"Activity in the eurobond market was dampened yesterday by the ongoing meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and jitters ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. The summer lull also continues to weigh on the market, but dealers said US dollar issuance might resume once the FOMC meeting was over - provided it bore no nasty surprises. ""Given the success of the World Bank's and Canada's issues, I think there's room for more 10-year paper,"" said one. Kansai International Airport is thought to be planning a transaction, with dealers expecting $200m of 10-year bonds via IBJ, with a yield spread rumoured to be in the high 20s. Among the sparse new offerings, Coventry Building Society made a rare appearance in the sterling sector with #100m of five-year floating-rate notes. It replaces a #100m issue which was called yesterday, making it the only outstanding Coventry deal in the market. Lead manager HSBC Markets said Coventry last year jointly topped UBS's annual survey of UK building societies with the Halifax Building Society. Moreover, the offering followed Monday's announcement of well-received interim results, it said. The bonds are rated single-A by IBCA, the European rating agency. HSBC said a sizeable part of the issue was placed away from traditional UK building-society accounts and reported buying by overseas banks, UK corporations and institutions. Other offerings were very much aimed at retail investors in continental Europe. In the D-Mark sector, triple-A rated Nederlandse Gasunie issued DM 200m of five-year bonds, yielding 17 basis points over German government notes, via Rabobank and SBC Warburg. ""Dutch credits are particularly popular in Switzerland,"" a syndicate official said. Another retail-targeted transaction was a NZ$100m issue for Commerzbank - the German bank's first appearance in the New Zealand dollar sector. Pricing of the bonds at five basis points over New Zealand government debt at the offer price compares favourably with a short-dated issue launched on Monday for the Province of Manitoba at a 6 basis point spread, lead manager Hambros Bank said. Commerzbank is rated Aa2/AA-and Manitoba A1/A+. South Africa's Department of Finance has appointed Merrill Lynch as lead manager of its forthcoming Yankee bond issue - its first foray into the US domestic bond market. Market conditions would determine the terms and timing of the deal, the department said. Market talk has been of $250m to $300m of 10-year bonds. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996.

335,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,TREASURIES LITTLE CHANGED AS FED HOLDS RATES.,"US Treasury bond prices ended yesterday virtually unchanged on the day after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee decided, as expected, to leave US interest rates unchanged. The benchmark 30-year bond first rose by 1/8 on publication of June trade figures and then fell back by 1/4 on news early in the afternoon of the FOMC's decision. By the end of the day, the long bond had returned to where it started in light trading, with the price at 99 3/8 and the yield at 6.794%. The outcome of the FOMC meeting, though widely predicted, brought some relief after caution had set in early in the day, leading to some profit-taking among holders of longer-dated securities. Earlier, the trade figures had showed a deficit for June of $8.1bn, below the $9.6bn that had been forecast and an outcome that underpinned the dollar. That gave a modest, though short-lived, boost to the fixed income markets. Shorter-dated securities were also largely unchanged after the FOMC meeting, with the two-year Treasury note standing at 100 9/16, a rise of 1/32 on the day, to yield 5.937%. * Italian bonds showed the worst performance among European markets for the second consecutive day, as political uncertainty rose. Liffe's September BTP future closed at 115.71, down 0.17, but fell to a low of 115.37 in trading after the exchange's official close. In the cash market the 10-year BTP yield spread over bunds widened by 3 basis points to 329 points. In addition to the ongoing budget-related uncertainty, BTPs suffered when the reformed communist party voiced its opposition to the sale of Stet, the state-owned telecommunications group, and threatened to withdraw its support from the coalition government. The economic environment, although more favourable, failed to support bonds. Wholesale and producer price indices were below market expectations, reinforcing ""the view that the headline inflation rate will fall in August"", according to economists at Bear Stearns, who now expect consumer price inflation to show a headline rate of 3.4% for August, down from 3.6% in July. The Bank of Italy hinted earlier this summer that it would cut official interest rates again when the inflation rate approached 3%. * UK gilts ended a quiet day slightly lower, as uncertainty over the outcome of the FOMC meeting weighed on market sentiment. Liffe's September long gilt future settled at 108, down 1/8. Traders largely ignored the release of mildly bullish money supply data. The M4 monetary aggregate rose by only 0.4% in July, bringing the year-on-year rate of growth down to 8.8%, below its official monitoring range for the first time in 10 months. The Bank of England yesterday announced the details of the August 28 gilt auction. A total of #2.5bn of 7 1/2% treasury stock due 2006 will be tendered. * German bunds weakened slightly, in spite of the release of encouraging money supply data. Liffe's September bund future closed at 98.05, down 0.03. The Bundesbank announced that M3 money supply had fallen in July to an annual growth rate of 8.6%, in line with market expectations. Hopes of a cut in the repo rate tomorrow were intact, with analysts predicting a 10 basis point easing, to 3.20%. ""The data do not increase the chances of a cut"", one trader said. ""But they do not rule them out either."" Although an easing is widely believed to be already priced into bunds, it could ""help put the convergence process [of the high-yielding markets] back on the tracks"", one trader said. Economists at UBS in Frankfurt, however, warn that ""a repo cut is not a safe bet and there is certainly a risk that the Bundesbank might disappoint the market again"". * The weakness of the rand continued to drive activity on the South African market yesterday. Bonds mirrored the state of the currency, which ended a quiet day weaker after the battering it took in New York on Monday following publication of a report which claimed that it was over-valued. Dealers said the bond market had been fairly stable, ""apart from some short-covering"" by local traders in the morning and ""a bit of institutional nibbling at higher levels"". After trading in a range between 15.655% and 15.710%, the yield on the key R150 stock was last pegged at 15.665%, up from 15.565% late on Monday. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996.

336,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,US STOCKS EDGE FORWARD AT MIDSESSION.,"AMERICA: Wall Street The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to edge ahead in very light trading as the US financial markets awaited the outcome of the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting, writes Richard Waters. Although most Wall Street economists had dismissed the chance of an interest rate increase at the meeting, the fixed income and equity markets generally marked time The index of leading stocks continued where it had left off on Monday, a day which had seen the second-lowest trading volume of the year. By lunchtime it was at 5,713.49, up 14.05. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 was up only 0.09 at 666.67, while the Nadsaq composite eased 3.27 to 1,127.64. The Dow's advance during the morning was driven largely by gains among companies whose earnings are most directly tied to the economic cycle. That reflected the general belief that US short-term interest rates will remain unchanged, at least until after November's presidential election. Among the biggest movers, Alcoa rose $1 1/8 to $62 7/8, while Caterpillar $7/8 to $71 1/4 and Du Pont $1 1/8 to $83 1/8. AT&T, which had been the biggest decliner in the Dow on Monday, recovered some of its lost ground, adding $1/4 to $54 3/8. That repaired some of the damage done by the departure of its highly regarded president, Mr Alex Mandl, who left to join Associated Communications, a new wireless telecommunications company. Associated Group, that company's main shareholder, rose $2 3/8 more to $32 5/8 after the $4 3/4 gain on Monday. AT&T's shares remain some 10% below their level of early July, when the company reported disappointing second quarter earnings. The general mood of optimism about interest rates contributed to a good morning for bank stocks. Chase Manhattan rose $3/4 to $77 5/8, a new high, while First Bank System was $7/8 higher at $63 3/4. Wells Fargo rose another $2 1/8 to $256 5/8. Another group to record solid gains were the tobacco stocks, which showed a further partial rebound from the sharp drops precipitated by an adverse court ruling 12 days ago. Philip Morris rose $1 3/8, to $91 1/4, and RJR Nabisco $1/2 to $27 1/4. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. "
337,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,TRADE FIGURE SURPRISE BOOSTS US DOLLAR.,"MARKETS REPORT: An unexpectedly sharp fall in the US trade deficit helped push the dollar higher against the Japanese yen, when most attention was focused on money supply data and interest rate decisions. Coming ahead of yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington yesterday, the deficit data finally took the dollar over Y 108, after being range-bound in recent weeks. At the close of trading in London, the dollar was at Y 108.330, from Y 107.950 the previous day. But the dollar was muted against European currencies, ending against the D-Mark at DM 1.4893, from DM 1.4882. Against sterling it was worth $1.5472, from $1.5455. The slight D-Mark weakness came after the announcement of long-awaited German money supply figures. The decline in M3 growth was accurately anticipated by the markets, after comments earlier this month by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, that it would fall. In Australia, the new conservative government's first budget proved to be a disappointment for those expecting large spending cuts. Mr Peter Costello, the federal treasurer, held out hopes of interest rate cuts to come, and the Australian dollar fell against the US dollar in London, ending at A$1.2718, from A$1.2658. * The only game in town continues to be Bundesbank-watching - at least for the next 24 hours. European cross trades continued to be dominated by expectations of a cut in the repurchase rate or a move by the bank to a variable repurchase rate sooner or later. Germany's July M3 growth fell to 8.6% year-on-year, from 9.6% in the previous month. The M3 fall may herald a cut by the Bundesbank in its repo rate at its central council meeting tomorrow. But rumours circulated in the markets that today's Ifo German business sentiment survey would be very strong. That, if true, would reduce the chances of a rate cut tomorrow. Some areas of the market appear to have already discounted a relatively big rate cut. But Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Paine Webber in London, warns that those expectations risk disappointment. She is expecting a cut of only 5 basis points, after the bank's success in talking the D-Mark down in recent months. ""They've exhausted their barking potential, and now they've got to have some bite,"" she said. The bank could also include a switch to a variable repo rate within the next week or two. Ms Cottrell said the Bundesbank would also be looking to help France after its recent currency travails, not for political reasons but because economic recovery in both countries is vulnerable. * The US trade deficit in goods and services declined to $8.11bn, from a revised $10.55bn gap in May. Analysts had expected a $9.4bn deficit in June. Mr Larry Hatheway, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said that the US trade data was the final confirmation that the Federal Reserve had no need to raise interest rates. ""It's a further sign that the economy is not as robust as was thought two or three months ago,"" he said. * The Australian government's budget turned out to be a victim of its own success, as analysts pronounced disappointment with the final deficit figure of A$5.65bn and a headline surplus of A$474m for 1996/97. The disappointment followed speculation of harsher spending cuts, to get the deficit below A$5bn. Mr Peter Costello, the treasurer, said he would like an interest rate cut by the end of 1996. ""I'd like that to be an outcome and I am going to do the best to make sure we are going to get it,"" he said. Mr Costello said a rate cut was possible when the budget was passed by the Senate, the Australian parliament's upper house. That puts pressure on opposition parties in the Senate not to block the new measures. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. "
338,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,FED HOLDS RATES STEADY.,"AMERICAN NEWS DIGEST: Fed holds rates steady The US Federal Reserve yesterday held interest rates steady amid signs that the economy is cooling off without inflationary pressures mounting. The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended with no announcement on interest rates or any explanation or description of the meeting. The FOMC, which includes the seven Fed governors in Washington and the presidents of five of the 12 regional Feds, also left rates unchanged at its last meeting on July 3. The last policy move by the central bank was to lower the discount rate to 5% from 5.25% and the Fed funds rate to 5.25% from 5.5% on January 31. The Fed chairman has the authority to move rates by as much as 1/2 a percentage point between meetings without a formal committee vote. Recently the FOMC has tended to make interest rate moves at committee meetings. AFX and Reuter, Washington. "
339,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - COMPANY STATEMENTS ENCOURAGE A FIRM MARKET - MARKET REPORT.,"London stock markets closed firmly yesterday, taking their lead from the US Treasuries, but without news from the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). UK traders were hoping that before London opens today the Fed will have delivered the keenly desired 1/2 percentage point increase in its key interest rates, hopes fulfilled by the Fed's rates move last night. 'Anything less than a half-point rise will not please the market,' was the consensus view at last night's London close of trading. After a slow start, UK shares moved ahead and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 7.9 better at 3,123.5. Although trading volume was higher than on the previous day, traders stressed that it was a cautious session. Stocks were easier for much of the day but the Footsie once again bounced convincingly when it slipped towards the 3,100 area; the day's low was 3,106.8. A survey of the distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry was favourably received. Although the awareness that the FOMC meeting would not even start until late in the London trading day inhibited activity in UK stocks, there were plenty of company trading statements to keep dealers on the alert. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has shown itself both independent of and somewhat weaker than the FT-SE 100 in recent sessions, finished just 0.3 up at 3,707.2. Seaq volume of 638.5m shares compared with 671.7m on Monday when retail business was worth #1.43bn. Favourable trading comments from a handful of blue chip companies aided sentiment. Allied-Lyons and Hanson said the year had begun satisfactorily and BOC, seen as an industrial market leader, traded heavily after a very positive interim statement. The stock market remained hopeful that determined action by the Fed would at last settle nerves in the bond market and, by stabilising bond yields, enable the equity market to respond to improvement in corporate dividends and earnings. While the markets will remain on tenterhooks until there is news from the FOMC meeting, London today faces important data on the domestic economy. UK analysts expect these to confirm that domestic inflation has remained subdued, and thus ward off fears that UK base rates will be forced higher later this year. Building and construction issues rose after the latest official statistics showed new orders were 10% up from the 1993 first quarter. But there were further signs that investors are turning away from the engineering and vehicles sec-tors, believed by some analysts to have outrun the economic recovery. Progress was somewhat patchy elsewhere in the market, with the food and brewery stocks showing a mixed picture as investors waited for the March retail sales statistics. Pharmaceuticals stocks continued to move nervously as attention focused on SmithKline Beecham and investors pondered the likely effect of the expiry this week of US patents on Tagamet, SmithKline's high selling anti-ulcer drug. London outperformed other leading European stock markets yesterday and UK traders sounded relatively confident that the Footsie can at last climb away from 3,100, if only the bond markets can establish themselves in a new trading range. Strategists were encouraged by the increase in trading volume as the market rallied yesterday afternoon. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
340,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES JUMP AFTER FED RAISES INTEREST RATES.,"After a morning of quiet anticipation, US Treasury bonds prices jumped yesterday afternoon on news that the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates by 50 basis points. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 25/32 higher at 87 9/16, with the yield slipping about 20 basis points to 7.276%. At the short end, the two-year note was up 5/32 at 99 1/4, to yield 5.894%. In early activity, investors were unwilling to make any fresh commitments as most were convinced the Fed would raise rates again after a meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Although there was a general consensus that a policy move was imminent, there was disagreement among traders over how aggressively the central bank would act. Most believed the discount rate - which the Fed charges on loans to commercial banks - was due for an increase of 50 basis points. In its previous three moves this year, the central bank had left the discount rate unchanged. However, traders were divided on whether the Fed would lift its target for the Federal funds rate - charged by banks on overnight loans to one another - by 50 or 25 basis points. In each of the previous tightenings, the Fed chose the more timid of the two figures. In the event, it decided on a more aggressive approach, lifting both the discount rate and Fed funds target by 50 basis points, to 3.50% and 4.25% respectively. The market's response was immediate. The moves helped the long end of the yield curve by easing any lingering concern over inflationary pressures. Shorter-term securities benefited as well, because the bold strike appeared to dispel the uncertainty engendered by the Fed's earlier gradualism. The decisiveness of yesterday's move suggested it was the last in the current series. This view was reinforced by the central bank in its announcement of the policy change. 'These actions, combined with the three previous adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,' it said. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, had said his goal was to shift the bank's policy until it had a 'neutral' impact on the economy. European trading was also overshadowed by the FOMC meeting, leaving most markets to drift sideways in moderate turnover. After tracking German bonds in the morning, French bonds spurted ahead in the afternoon. Some traders said this was caused by late short-covering in the futures pits in expectation of bond-positive news from the Fed. Moreover, investors were switching from Germany into France, said Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London. The June notional French bond future rose 0.34 points to close at 121.10. The June Bund future was down 0.16 points in after-hours trading at 95.67. In Germany, the focus today will be on the Bundesbank's latest allocation of securities repurchase agreements. German money market traders surveyed by MMS International expect the minimum rate to fall by 12 basis points to 5.23%. Trade in the UK government bond market was again quiet ahead of the results of the FOMC meeting and today's UK economic data. The market firmed in afternoon trading, largely on the back of strength in US Treasuries, The June long gilt futures contract was up 5/16 at 105 11/32 in after-hours trading. The Bank of England announcement that its May 25 gilt auction would be of #2bn of 7.0% 1997 stock, convertible into 9.0% 2012 stock, for the first time on August 6, drew little reaction 'This is a very uncertain issue,' said Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets. 'There is no other stock like it in the market, which makes pricing it very difficult.' But analysts said there would be sufficient demand. Today's release of UK average earnings and RPI data coincides with the publication of the minutes of the March meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. 'The avalanche of information could cause quite a choppy time in the markets, especially if there is a pick-up in earnings and inflation, and if there are signs of a disagreement between the chancellor and the governor,' said Mr Smith. The Italian bond market is awaiting today's vote of confidence in the Senate on prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Although his coalition is short of a majority in the Senate, most observers expect him to scrape through. Meanwhile, technical distortions at the long end of the Italian yield curve have created buying opportunities, said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
341,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - HESITANT TOKYO MILDLY EASIER.,"Tokyo Investors remained inactive ahead of the US Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee meeting, and the Nikkei 225 average declined on index linked selling by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally 54.91 easier at 20,133.53 after a day's low of 20,067.41 and high of 20,174.93. A fall in futures prices on the overnight Chicago market prompted a bout of arbitrage selling earlier in the session. Small-lot buying by overseas investors later eroded some of the losses. Volume remained low, totalling 251m shares against 285m. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.58 to 1,636.43 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.54 at 299.13. Declines led rises by 614 to 369, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.19 firmer at 1,335.88. Market participants said many investors were still wary of any surprises from the spate of company earnings announcements and were reluctant to commit funds in spite of the yen's easing against the dollar. Meanwhile, technical indicators were also worrying some dealers. 'The three short term moving averages nearly converging, the lack of volatility and the very low volumes seem to be precursors of a sharp move up or down,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai, analyst at Daiwa Securities. High-technology stocks were higher on buying by foreign investors. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y 5 to Y 1,000 and Toshiba put on Y 3 at Y 798. Large-capital steels were also firmer, with Kawasaki Steel up Y 2 to Y 385. Some banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y 10 to Y 1,950. Profit-taking depressed real estate and pharmaceuticals shares, previously bought as laggards. Mitsubishi Estate receded Y 20 to Y 1,220 and Takeda Chemical Y 30 to Y 1,230. The rise in gold and copper prices buoyed mining shares. Dowa Mining advanced Y 12 to Y 585 and Sumitomo Metal Mining added Y 13 at Y 925. The low volume encouraged individual investors' trading in speculative stocks. Ga-jo-en Kanko forged ahead Y 27 to Y 184 and Wakachiku Construction gained Y 9 at Y 669. Brother Industries, however, relinquished Y 13 to Y 706 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 57.55 to 22,366.93 in volume of 20.4m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits retailer, fell Y 120 to Y 4,180. Roundup Regional markets continued mixed, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting. HONG KONG closed sharply lower as the brief detention of a prominent Beijing dissident raised worries about the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status with the US in a market already cautious about US interest rates. The Hang Seng index dropped 208.71, or 2.3%, to 9,044.70. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.88bn, against a revised HKDollars 4.10bn on Monday. The market was also speculating about a possible early agreement with China on financing Hong Kong's new airport, but news that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet on Friday to discuss the issue emerged after the market close.

Financials led the falls, with China Development down TDollars 3.5 to TDollars 129.5 and Cathay Life losing TDollars 6 to TDollars 257. SINGAPORE was steady with selective buying seen among blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 14.08 higher at 2,304.49. Shipyard stocks were firmer amid talk that a foreign brokerage was issuing covered warrants on a basket of shipyard companies. KUALA LUMPUR was easier after a moderate session, a spate of selling near the close having pushed the index down from an early high.

SEOUL turned higher in a technical rebound after its three-day consolidation, and the composite index improved 5.21 to 946.87 ahead of today's market holiday. MANILA rose strongly, helped by an overnight gain on Wall Street for PLDT, together with buying of San Miguel and Manila Electric. The composite index moved forward 34.20 to 2,936.43. Turnover was 950.4m pesos. PLDT put on 50 pesos at 1,955 pesos, San Miguel 'B' increased 5 pesos to 235 and Manila Electric added 5 pesos at 330. BOMBAY's 30-share index registered a 41.59 decline at 3,802.50 after index-weighted shares fell, but the broader market was steady after a dull session. Hopes remained high, however, that forward trading will be allowed to resume after a meeting of the Securities and Exchange Board of India on Friday. The old badla, or carry forward system, was banned in mid-March on the grounds that it led to excessive speculation.

342,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - LUFTHANSA SHOWS FURTHER WEAKNESS IN GERMANY.,"The markets were generally lacklustre awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting. FRANKFURT moved into retreat as Monday's record levels failed to inspire a follow on of momentum. The Dax index eased back 11.40 to 2,259.71 during the official session. Turnover was DM 7.4bn. Sentiment was upset by news that Schneider debt was higher than anticipated, with estimates of between DM 3.5bn to DM 4bn. This report affected the banks who are exposed to the property group with Deutsche Bank, for example, slipping DM 10 to DM 781.50. Lufthansa continued to weaken on a further round of selling following disappointment over its results on Monday, the shares down a further DM 11.30 to DM 190.20, bringing accumulated losses since the start of the week to 8%. In contrast, Volkswagen rose DM 3.20 to DM 528.70 on news that it was extending working hours at some plants. Nikko Europe issued a buy recommendation earlier in the week, noting that the restructuring programmes should begin to bear fruit in the near term. Furthermore, said Nikko, 'Seat should report a considerable reduction in last year's loss of DM 1.8bn, with a return to profit in 1995 the target'. PARIS took a long look at Eurotunnel which held a shareholders meeting yesterday to approve its rights issue plans. The group lost FFr 1.30 to FFr 35.10 but off a session low of FFr 34.70 as the CAC-40 index rose 7.47 to 2,195.17. Turnover was a moderate FFr 3.7bn. Oil stocks were active as Merrill Lynch added Elf Aquitaine and OMV to its stock selection list and deleted Total and Repsol. Of the French groups Elf was FFr 2.70 stronger at FFr 429.70 while Total shed FFr 4.90 to FFr 342.10. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr 12 at FFr 598, denied that it was planning to raise fresh capital, while Club Med slipped FFr 1.90 to FFr 446.10 as it forecast a better first half result. MILAN began the new account in resilient mood, the Comit index rising 11.89 or 1.5% to 801.62, as worries subsided about the outcome of today's parliamentary confidence vote. Blue chips led the advance. Generali rose L1,567 or 3.3% to L48,470, Fiat advanced L149 to L7,188 and Olivetti was L128 or 4.5% higher at L3,003. Ciga, the hotels group advanced L76 or 6.8% to L1,188 in heavy volume of 36m shares amid speculation about stock building as its rights issue sold out. Ferruzzi put on L149 or 7.1% to L2,233 as the company launched its L1,340bn rights issue. Cir rose L134 or 4.7% to L2,994 as its L1,060bn rights issue began, although technical problems blocked business in the rights throughout the session. ZURICH continued on the upward track as domestic buying, and an absence of foreign selling, took the SMI index 18.1 higher to 2,727.1. Roche certificates added SwFr 155 to SwFr 6,705 as presentations to analysts yesterday and on Monday were well received and details of the Syntex takeover appeared to be positive. The certificates have picked up 9% since their low on May 9, following 1993 figures and the Syntex acquisition. However, analysts noted that yesterday's demand came from Swiss banks, buying for their own account, and that sentiment remained fragile. Nestle, another recent weak performer, rose SwFr 20 to SwFr 1,135, on the perception that recent falls had been overdone. Brown Boveri rose SwFr 13 to SwFr 1,275 ahead of today's first quarter figures, with some analysts forecasting a rise of up to 75% in profit. STOCKHOLM maintained a strong run with Astra featuring ahead of first quarter results that came out after the close of business. The Affarsvarlden general index added 7.70 to 1,552.50. Turnover was SKr2.6bn. Astra reported a 15% rise in first quarter pretax profits - the B shares ended the day up SKr1 at SKr161. Volvo, which releases its first quarter figures today, picked up SKr13 in the B shares to SKr758. AMSTERDAM struggled to find some incentive to move and, with the exception of a Fl 2.30 loss in KLM to Fl 53.20, due in partly to profit-taking following good gains last week, the AEX index finished the session just 0.81 ahead at 413.81. MADRID overcame some early profit-taking with late demand taking the general index up 0.71 to finish at the day's high of 334.91 in heavy turnover of Pta36.59bn. Banks, however, remained under pressure with Banesto Pta25 easier at Pta1,120. Argentaria lost Pta100 to Pta6,000 and Santander was marked Pta80 lower at Pta6,350. Agroman, the construction company, was the day's leader, rising Pta75 to Pta825. ISTANBUL rose 3.55% on a technical rebound following a reduction in interest rates. The composite index put on 549.02 to 16,032.68. On Monday the index lost 1%. ATHENS ended slightly lower in light trading as investors remained worried about the prospect of devaluation. The general share index lost 7.95 at 944.94. Turnover was Dkr2.7bn. Written and edited by Michael Morgan and John Pitt (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
343,1989-07-06,1989-07-07,Financial Times,REBOUNDING DOLLAR SUPPORTS BONDS.,"A rebound in the dollar after its precipitious fall in recent days helped US Treasury bonds to arrest their decline this week. Trading remained cautious prior to today's US unemployment figures and as dealers watched the Fed closely for any signs of a change in monetary policy. In late trading, some long-dated issues were quoted 1/2 point higher, while the Treasury's benchmark long bond stood 3/8 point up for a yield of 8.09 per cent. The short end of the market was up around 1/8 point, reflecting some caution after outperforming the long end earlier in the week. The dollar was quoted well above earlier lows of Y137.85 and DM1.8790 to stand at Y138.85 and DM1.8860 in late trading. This was the key factor helping bond prices yesterday. The Fed decided not to execute matched sales to drain liquidity from the money market yesterday, although bond analysts said there was a need to drain to maintain the status quo on the Fed funds rate. The omission suggested to some that an easing move may have begun. The FOMC was due to end its two-day meeting yesterday. Fed funds had traded steadily at 9 1/2 per cent throughout the morning session yesterday, then slipped to 9 3/8 per cent after the Fed's intervention time went by with no operation. The yield curve maintained its upward tilt yesterday with three-month bills yielding around 8.02 per cent and two-year bond issues yielding around 7.89 per cent. Few had expected any decision to emerge from the FOMC until it had seen today's unemployment figures for June. The consensus forecast is for a rise in the non-farm payroll of just over 200,000 compared with May's gain of 101,000.

The consensus forecast is for a rise in the non-farm payroll of just over 200,000 compared with May's gain of 101,000. The June figures include five rather than four weeks of unemployment statistics, which accounts for the larger expected rise in the non-farm payroll. A figure of anywhere around 200,000 would be construed as showing enough economic weakness for the Fed to ease Fed funds by another 1/4 point. A figure of 250,000 or more would be interpreted as restraining any easing move by the Fed. Bond economists cautioned that there is considerable risk that the bond market could suffer more from a strong gain in the non-farm payroll than benefit from a weak number because expectations of a soft number are so widespread. * * * The French Government yesterday carried out its first auction of Ecu-denominated state bonds, following the successful syndicated sale of the same Ecu bond in April. The Government accepted bids for 352 m Ecus, 45 per cent of the bids submitted, at a cut-off price of 99.55 per cent, giving a weighted average yield of 8.56 per cent. April's placing, bought mostly by individual investors, had a yield of 8.66 per cent. Dealers said that the first auction tranche should go a considerable way towards making the 8.5 per cent 1997 Fcu bond into a reference for the market. Most of the April placing is firmly held, but around 100 m Ecus worth is still to be traded. The dealers said that yesterday's tranche, bought mostly by international institutions, would add perhaps 300 m Ecus to the float. At the same auction, the Government sold FFr 8.7 bn of French franc bonds, including FFr 3.77 bn of the 10-year fixed rate OAT 8.125 per cent 1999. The Government accepted less than a quarter of the bids submitted, and the cut-off price gave an average yield on the 10-year bond of 8.7 per cent, 23 basis points below the last auction of this bond in May. Only FFr 2 bn was sold of the floating rate OAT TME 2001, indexed on the average of government bond secondary market yields. The margin of 40 basis points below the index was considerably tighter than the 63 basis points recorded when the bond was last auctioned in April. The FFr 2 bn accepted at a price of 97.4 per cent was well clear of the rest of the market. The remaining FFr 5.75 bn of bids went no higher than 97.2 per cent. * * * The success of the French auction helped push the Paris government bond market higher, and prices ended the day 20 to 25 centimes above Wednesday's close. It thus provided a contrast to most of the other European markets, where the prospect of today's US unemployment figures and the feeling that the dollar's recent sharp declines may be due for a temporary reversal made for a cautionary approach. Nevertheless, with a current yield differential of more than 2 per cent above its German counterpart, there are still expectations that the French market can outstrip the performance of its neighbours. The German market turned lower, despite purchases in the market by the Bundesbank, even after a firmer start. The announcement of revised inflation figures, showing inflation in the year to June at 3.1 per cent, instead of the provisionally estimated 2.9 per cent, led the market to lose its early morning gains. The market closed about 10 pfennigs weaker, with some US investment banks reported to be switching out of the German market into US Treasuries and into the French market. The Dutch market kept in step with the German, preserving a yield premium of about 40 basis points. The UK market's three-day rally stalled too, with investors becoming cautious about whether sterling can indefinitely sustain the gains of the past couple of weeks. Sterling's trade-weighted index was 0.1 point higher at 91.9, but conventional gilt prices were up to 1/4 point lower. "

Having spent much of the day locked in a tight range, the indices jerked upward immediately after the central bank declared victory over deflation and said it would be cautious in lifting borrowing costs from their 46-year lows.

Even though the Fed said price stability had been achieved, several economic indicators have hinted at increasing inflationary pressures. As such, traders and investors are only concerned with, and have struggled to prepare for, the timing of an interest rate increase and its consequences for the economy and profits.

We all know it will happen. . . . What's the big deal?"" Ryan Beck's Mr Suskind concurred. ""I think (a rate rise) is already priced in, the market is already ahead of the Fed"". He added that rising interest rates in a growing economy were preferable to low interest rates in a recessionary climate. ""A gradual slowdown in economic activity may actually be quite beneficial to facilitating positive longer-term prospects for the economy and stock market,"" added Mr Riley.

346,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times,Measure for measure - THE LEX COLUMN.,"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is no longer making a virtue of patience. The outlook for both sustainable economic growth and for inflation is now balanced. That makes the case for retaining the emergency federal funds rate of 1 per cent for much longer look weak. There is, however, a long journey ahead before the Federal Reserve gets within sight of a ""neutral"" level, which many put at above 3.5 per cent. Given the continuing slack in the US economy, high productivity growth and low levels of inflation there is little rush. And there will be fevered debate at what level ""neutral"" really is in today's world. But the Fed's challenge is to kick off the tightening process without unnerving the markets. So far, so good. The Federal Open Market Committee will no longer be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"", but it will remove it at a pace that is ""likely to be measured"". That should reassure investors that the Fed has learnt from 1994 - when a sharp tightening cycle caused turmoil in the bond markets. It offers no guarantees, however. While the Fed has signalled it is ""likely"" to move gingerly, it has left itself the option of more aggressive action. In reality investors learnt little yesterday they had not worked out for themselves. Interest rates are set to go up. The Fed has no plans to go for a kamikaze increase. But the outlook has already shifted dramatically in a matter of months. The Fed's desire for a ""measured"" approach will remain at the mercy of job creation and inflation data as the year progresses. "

348,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times,Shift in stance as Fed leaves interest rates on hold.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a shift in its stance on monetary policy, leaving interest rates unchanged while saying that inflation risks are now balanced and that rates would be raised ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's latest hints about the looming US rate rise come as the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets to discuss raising rates for what would be the third time since November. In its statement, released after the meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed dropped its commitment to be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"". Instead, it said: ""At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" The decision to leave the federal funds rate on hold at 1 per cent was universally expected, and attention was focused on changes to the statement for clues to the FOMC's intentions for the future. Futures markets suggest expectations of a quarter point increase in the fed funds rate by the time of the FOMC's August meeting. The statement did little to discourage such expectations or to encourage the idea that the Fed will raise rates when it meets at the end of June. In Britain, independent economists overwhelmingly expect that the Bank of England will raise its main interest rate a quarter point to 4.25 per cent tomorrow. However the MPC is also seen as likely to proceed slowly with further increases. The futures markets, which MPC members have suggested are a useful benchmark for expectations, imply the Bank's main interest rate will be about 4.75 per cent at the end of the year, and about 5 per cent at the end of next year. Household borrowing figures and two business surveys yesterday reinforced the case for higher rates. The CBI reported a surge in retail sales in April; in its distributive trades survey, 51 per cent of respondents said sales were up on a year ago, while 21 per cent said they were down. In the manufacturing industry, for which the official output data have been disappointing in recent months, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported a strong rise in its purchasing managers' index from 53.8 in March to 55.1 in April.

349,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times (FT.Com),Dollar falls as FOMC dashes talk of June rate rise.,"The dollar fell to a four-week low against the euro in London morning trade on Wednesday after the US authorities said they could afford to be ""measured"" in raising interest rates from 46-year lows. As widely expected, the Federal Open Market Committee said the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth were now ""roughly equal"" and the risks to price stability have ""moved into balance"". The well-worn phrase that the FOMC could be ""patient"" in removing its policy accommodation also disappeared this time around. But the replacement: ""that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured"", created almost as many questions as it answered. Most took the statement to mean that US rates will not rise in June. With no meeting planned for July, August would thus be the first opportunity for a hike - at the dovish end of prior expectations. ""The FOMC has set itself up to where its earliest hike can't come until August 10 because the statement is insufficient to prep the market for a June 30 rate hike,"" said Aziz McMahon, currencies strategist at ABN Amro. Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York, argued against a June rise on the grounds that several Fed officials have called for ""several months"" of continued improvement in the jobs market before sanctioning a rate rise, a desire probably not satisfied by the FOMC's assertion that ""hiring appears to have picked up"". National Australia Bank and Credit Agricole Indosuez also plumped for an August tightening, but Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, broke ranks by calling the meeting a ""stepping stone towards a June hike. ""Failure to raise rates in June shall induce risks of being behind the curve in the face of a potentially strong June labour report, due in July 2 when there is no FOMC meeting, and in the face of a strong July labour report, due in August 6."" said Mr Laidi. ""Thus if the Fed stands pat in the June meeting, its next meeting won't be until August, three payroll reports later. Should those reports show strong job creation, the Fed will then have to tighten by 50 basis points in August, which may appear to be too late, always a negative for the markets and the dollar."" However with the more dovish argument holding sway, the dollar extended Tuesday's sell-off, slipping a further cent against the euro to $1.2157, a four-week low. The greenback also fell to a two-week low against sterling at $1.7977 and lost Y1 against the yen at Y109.08. Even the Australian dollar made headway against its US namesake, rising a US cent to $0.7315, despite the Reserve Bank of Australia holding rates at 5.25 per cent overnight. "

Stocks traded in negative territory for most of the morning after a disappointing report on economic growth but materials and industrial companies led a rebound after the FOMC decision.  The Fed's accompanying statement warned that financial markets remained ""under considerable stress"" amid ""a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labour markets."" In mid-afternoon the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,367.93 having gained as much as 1.2 per cent. The index had traded down 0.2 per cent prior to the Fed's announcement. The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 2,364.51 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 12,538.59.  Financial stocks came under pressure after UBS, the Swiss bank, took Dollars 14bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter, Dollars 4bn more than previously advised. The writedown included a Dollars 2bn hit which analysts speculated was linked to troubled monoline bond insurers.  Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said banks may have to write down up to Dollars 70bn if bond insurers lose their AAA credit ratings, with losses concentrated at Citigroup , Merrill Lynch and UBS. Citi rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 28.31 after the Fed decision, while Merrill gave up 0.8 per cent to Dollars 56.99 after its chief executive, John Thain, said the bank's net exposure to monoline insurers was Dollars 3.5bn.  Lazard avoided the severe problems affecting the banking sector as fourth-quarter earnings at the merger advisory firm rose 43 per cent. The company renewed its chief executive's contract for five years and the shares rose 7.7 per cent to Dollars 38.41.

The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 2,364.51 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 12,538.59.  A cut of 50bp was almost universally expected with the futures market having priced in a 72 per cent likelihood of such a move. The Fed has now cut interest rates by 125bp in little more than a week responding to concerns that the US economy is slowing rapidly.  Further evidence of this contraction was provided by a report which showed the economy slowed sharply to a 0.6 per cent growth rate in the last three months of 2007, only half the rate forecast by economists and down from 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter. For all of 2007, the economy expanded at its slowest pace since 2002, growing just 2.2 per cent.  However, a snapshot of private sector employment painted a contrasting picture, as a projection of hiring in January by ADP showed a rise of 130,000 jobs.  Although ADP numbers can be volatile, economists now expect the closely watched January employment report, due on Friday, to show a gain of 65,000, up from 18,000 in December.  ""There are two possible interpretations of the job situation,"" said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""Either we are going to experience a 'joblessness' stall in growth, just as we experienced a jobless recovery, or the economy remains somewhat insulated from the continuing credit crisis - at least for now.""  Financial stocks came under pressure after UBS, the Swiss bank, took Dollars 14bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter, Dollars 4bn more than previously advised. The writedown included a Dollars 2bn hit which analysts speculated was linked to troubled monoline bond insurers.  Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said banks may have to write down up to Dollars 70bn if bond insurers lose their AAA credit ratings, with losses concentrated at Citigroup , Merrill Lynch and UBS. ""This is significant, as many investors are of the belief that the fourth quarter was a 'kitchen sink' for all outstanding capital hits this credit cycle,"" Ms Whitney said. ""When it becomes clear (as we think it will) that more charges are on the horizon, we believe the market will take another turn for the worse.""  Citi rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 28.31 after the Fed decision, while Merrill gave up 0.8 per cent to Dollars 56.99 after its chief executive, John Thain, said the bank's net exposure to monoline insurers was Dollars 3.5bn.

356,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times,Treasury yields up after rates rise GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasury yields jumped yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve raised borrowing rates to 4.75 per cent as expected and continued to suggest further rate hikes ""may be needed"". The Federal Open Market Committee, meeting under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship for the first time, raised rates for a fifteenth consecutive time by 0.25 per cent. Although it changed the wording of its economic assessment, the FOMC left policy-related passages of the statement unchanged, leaving the door open for further rate hikes. ""In sticking to the January text, the statement makes clear that the Fed's inclination is to raise rates again,"" said Rob Carnell of ING Financial Markets. Half an hour after the Fed's statement, yields on two-year notes were 5.2 basis points higher at 4.795 per cent, while 10-year yields were up 6.7bp at 4.776 per cent. Longer-dated yields had started rising earlier, thanks to a surprise jump in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and a surge in German business confidence. That news also propelled eurozone government bond yields to multi-year highs yesterday. The headline business climate indicator of the closely-watched Ifo survey rose to a 15-year high of 105.4, fuelling fears of more aggressive interest rate increases in the eurozone. The sell-off sent the yield on the two-year Schatz 8.1 basis points higher to 3.256 per cent in late trading after earlier hitting its highest level since November 2002. The yield on the 10-year Bund rose 8.4bp to 3.728 per cent, close to a one-year high. Lucy Hartiss, international economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We see rates reaching 3.5 per cent by year-end, with the next move coming in May."" The market is pricing in a rate of 3.25 per cent by year's end with a moderate risk of 3.5 per cent, analysts said. Gilts took a hit from the bearish sentiment. The yield on the two-year gilt added 2.6bp to 4.449 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield rose 3.2bp to 4.370 per cent. Long-dated gilt prices also fell as the UK Debt Management Office announced hefty supply of long-dated issuance for the next quarter, including more of both 50-year conventional and inflation-linked gilts and the introduction of a new 40-year gilt. The 50-year gilt yield rose 4.2bp to 3.919 per cent. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose 1.5bp to 1.700 per cent. "
357,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times,"US keeps rate rises going with 15th move - Figures show optimism in UK, Italy and Germany.","US interest rates yesterday moved above those in the UK for the first time in five years as the Federal Reserve reacted to rising inflation and the strength of the US economy with its 15th consecutive quarter-point increase to4.75 per cent. The US move came as Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, told a parliamentary committee that he expected ""a rapidly expanding world economy"" to help support consumer demand and that robust public spending growth would sustain UK economic growth at its long-term average of about 2.75 per cent. His remarks reinforced expectations that the Bank of England's main interest rate would remain on hold at 4.5 per cent. Mr King said that consumer price inflation would rise above its2 per cent target in the short-term because of steep gas price increases but that the overall economic picture was ""benign"". Mr King's optimism on the world economy coincided with figures showing German business exuberance at a 15-year high, Italian business confidence at a five-year high and US consumer confidence at its highest level in four years. German business confidence has been boosted by the country's success in export markets, while eurozone credit figures also point to robust economic growth, boosting the case for an early increase in European Central Bank interest rates from 2.5 per cent, perhaps in May. Sterling weakened against the euro on the strong data, and as Mr King's comments were interpreted as a sign that the Bank of England was in no hurry to change interest rates. In the US, the first meeting of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee chaired by Ben Bernanke indicated that the current cycle of interest rate increases was nearing a close, while repeating that some further policy firming may be needed dependent on the incoming data. In its statement, the FOMC said the economy had rebounded in the first quarter after a weak end to 2005, and that growth ""appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace"". Sounding a somewhat more confident note on the inflation outlook, the committee said that high energy prices appeared to have had only a ""modest"" effect on core inflation, at a time when productivity growth had kept labour market inflation in check. It said that inflation expectations remained contained. But the committee also repeated the warning that rising resource utilisation and elevated energy prices could feed into increased inflation pressure. In a repeat of the language used in its January meeting, it said ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance"".

358,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Eurozone bond yields hit new highs.,"Eurozone government bond yields hit new multi-year highs on Wednesday in the trading session that followed the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The move in the US, coupled with more hawkish sentiment from European Central Bank policymakers, put pressure on bond prices and sent yields higher. Bond prices were already bruised from Tuesday's data showing a jump in business sentiment in both Germany and Italy. Evidence that economic recovery in the eurozone is gaining momentum has raised fears of more aggressive interest rate rises by the ECB. ""After a few weeks of consolidation, government bond markets have capitulated again thanks to a combination of the strong German Ifo [business sentiment] survey and the Fed's fifteenth consecutive rate hike last night,"" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. ""Yields should continue to rise from here,"" he added. In afternoon trading, the yield on the two-year Schatz was up 1.2 basis points to 3.284 per cent and the 10-year Bund yield added 0.1bp to 3.746 per cent. But earlier, the two-year Schatz yield had risen nearly 2bp to 3.289 percent, its highest since mid-October 2002, adding to the 8bp rise on Tuesday. The Federal Open Market Committee in the US, meeting under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship for the first time, raised rates for a fifteenth consecutive time by 0.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent on Tuesday. Although it changed the wording of its economic assessment, the FOMC left policy-related passages of the statement unchanged, leaving the door open for further rate hikes. Gilts fared better after data showed that UK mortgage lending slowed in February while retail sales remained subdued this month. But prices were still lower overall and the two-year gilt yield was up 1bp to 4.459 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield rose 1.5bp to 4.385 per cent. "
359,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar firm as higher US rates eyed.,"The US dollar held onto Tuesday's gains in European morning trade on Wednesday as the market priced-in the near certainty of US interest rates hitting 5 per cent in May. The dollar had actually been soft for much of Tuesday, but rallied on the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy statement. The Fed, as expected raised rates for the 15th straight meeting, to 4.75 per cent. More importantly, the accompanying statement hinted at more to come, with the FOMC stating that the US economy had ""rebounded strongly"" in the current quarter, that possible increases in resource utilisation, in combination with elevated energy and other commodity prices, ""have the potential to add to inflation pressures"" and that some further policy tightening ""may be needed"". The market responded by regarding a May rate hike, always a strong prospect, as a done deal. Yet the statement did little to cement prospects for further rises beyond that. As a result although the dollar rose, it did not break out of recent ranges, trading at $1.2018 against the euro, Y117.82 versus the yen and SFr1.3089 versus the Swiss franc. ""The market now has greater conviction in its view that US interest rates will rise to 5 per cent by the summer; but the custom designed flexibility of the FOMC statement, tempered as it now is with conditionality and subjectivity, precludes any clear market insight beyond the next economic data release,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist Bank of New York. Chris Gothard, currencies strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, added: ""The statement was mildly hawkish. Overall though, the message wasn't strong enough to reinvigorate the dollar enough to break out of any significant ranges."" The dollar did however push to $1.7371 against sterling, from $1.7494 prior to the Fed statement, with the pound also falling 0.35c to GBP0.6918 against the euro and Y0.8 to Y204.70 against the yen on Wednesday. Sterling lost ground as UK mortgage approvals fell in February for the first time since October 2004, the CBI's distributive trades survey came in weak and the UK's current account deficit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised upwards. Tom Vosa, head of market economics at National Australia Bank, was gloomy on sterling's prospects, adding: ""The pound looks vulnerable today after the increase in US official interest rates overnight took US rates above those in the UK for the first time since January 2001."" Elsewhere the Hungarian forint continued its slide, falling Ft1.5 to a 14-month low of Ft267.23 to the euro, with Claire Dissaux at Calyon warning that Hungary's twin current account and budget deficits will continue to weigh on the currency. ""Short-term interest rates of 6 per cent are nowhere near high enough to justify holding Hungarian forint assets for anything but the short-term,"" she concluded. "

""A hawkish note was sounded by Ben Bernanke at last night's FOMC meeting with US interest rates rising as expected by 25 basis points, accompanied by the suggestion that further rate hikes will be seen to keep inflationary pressures in check. This pushed stocks lower on Wall Street ahead of the close and is likely to weigh on European indices in early trade although an upturn in economic data as we approach the month-end should ensure that there's no shortage of momentum over the next couple of days,"" Matt Buckland of CMC Markets said.

361,2003-09-16,2003-09-17,Financial Times,Wall Street climbs as Fed holds rates steady AMERICAS.,"Wall Street traded higher yesterday morning as investors welcomed news that inflation remained in check while news that the Federal Reserve held interest rates also buoyed the market. In the latest bit of economic data, consumer price inflation showed headline prices rose 0.3 per cent in August, from 0.2 per cent the previous month, in line with forecasts. Chris Wolfe, global equity strategist at JP Morgan's private bank, said the data, plus a Manpower survey that showed US companies intend to boost hiring later in the year, helped buoy investor sentiment. ""The Manpower survey puts the linchpin in place for equity investors - better labour markets,"" he said. He added that the relatively few negative pre-announcements from companies heading into earnings season, plus steadily increasing earnings forecasts from Wall Street analysts, have also helped the market's mood. But trade was thin ahead of the rate decision by the Fed's open market committee. The FOMC did not change rates or policy significantly from its last meeting in August, when it said the economy was picking up speed, with evenly balanced upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 42.32 to 9,491.13, the S&P 500 added 6.08 to 1,020.89, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 20.14 to 1,865.84. Technology stocks continued to lead the way, as investors anticipating an economic recovery continued to see chipmakers as the best bet. The semiconductor sector was the best performer in the S&P 500, up 2.1 per cent. The stars of the group were Applied Micro Circuits, 4.6 per cent higher at $5.75, PMC-Sierra, up 3.4 per cent to $14, and Teradyne, which rose 3.1 per cent to $20.83. Nicole Salvatore, a technology trader at Banc of America Securities, said: ""People are really buying the dips."" She reported seeing special investor interest in National Semiconductor, which was among the best performers in the past quarter, rising 70 per cent compared with a gain of 4.7 per cent for the S&P 500. The shares were up 1.3 per cent at $33.93 by midday. Technology hardware followed chips on the best-performers list, up 1.7 per cent. Lucent Technologies climbed 4.5 per cent to $2.32, Sanmina-SCI rose 3.9 per cent to $9.36 and Gateway tacked on 2.8 per cent to $6.23. Economically sensitive financial services stocks were also winners, up 1.1 per cent. Investors bid up Charles Schwab, the online broker, which rose 4.7 per cent to $12.02 after the company said daily trading increased from a year ago, and that it was likely to meet or beat analysts' estimates for the third quarter. Morgan Stanley followed, up 2.8 per cent to $50.46. On the flip side, the relatively few losers were defensive stocks, including consumer staples and food and beverage retailers. The three biggest losers on the S&P 500 were supermarket chains. Kroger, the largest in the US, fell 7.9 per cent to $17.18 after it announced a sharp fall in profits and cut its outlook for the full year. The company cited increasing operating costs and increased competition. Investors fretted about the entire sector and sent shares of rivals Safeway and Albertson's down 4.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively. Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecoms equipment maker, sold $1.3bn of third-generation equipment to Orange, the French mobile operator. The company also announced it had won new contracts in China worth $139m. Nortel shares rose 6.5 per cent to $4.42. Titan, the defence technology company, was the top performer on the New York Stock Exchange, up nearly 26 per cent to $21.35 on news it would be bought by Lockheed Martin for $1.8bn. The largest US defence contractor is making a bid to expand its homeland security business. Shares in Lockheed fell 2.1 per cent to $49.91. London Edition 1. "
362,2003-09-16,2003-09-17,Financial Times,Fed reaffirms low rates target FOMC DECISION.,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday, as the vast majority of investors had expected, and reiterated its commitment to keeping rates low until the risk of falling inflation had dissipated. The decision by the Fed's open market committee, which was unanimous, was similar to its judgment at its previous meeting in August, following the quarter-point rate cut in June. In a statement released with the decision, the Fed said that rates would remain low ""for a considerable period"". The statement was almost identical to that issued in August, saying that the risk that inflation would fall further outweighed the risk it would rise. But it was slightly more pessimistic about the labour market, saying it was weakening rather than that indicators were mixed. The use of almost identical wording suggests that the Fed's review of its communications policy, which followed turbulence in the financial markets after the June meeting, has yet to feed into FOMC decisions. Stocks rose after the announcement, probably reflecting relief that the Fed had maintained its commitment to keep rates low. Investors had priced in a chance of less than 5 per cent that the Fed would raise rates rather than leaving them on hold, following clear signals from officials. The Fed has argued that while the US recovery is gathering strength, there is as yet scant evidence that this is translating into higher inflationary pressure. With most estimates showing a degree of slack in the economy, companies have continued to struggle to make price rises stick. ""Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted,"" the Fed's statement said. The lack of pricing power was underlined yesterday by the release of figures showing that underlying inflation had fallen to its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The consumer price index excluding food and energy rose just 1.3 per cent in the 12 months to August, its lowest since 1966. The slowing rise in prices of medical services and ""shelter costs"" - principally rent and the implied rent paid by homeowners - contributed to much of the fall in core inflation. Fed officials have privately warned that the calculations used to create those shelter costs may overstate the fall in inflation. But economists said that the lack of much apparent upward pressure in inflation was likely to keep the Fed on hold for several months. London Edition 1. "

AFTER Monday's unseasonal excitement, caused by a small intervention rate increase in France, bond markets relapsed into pre-Christmas inactivity - at James Capel Gilts, traders played chess to while-away the hours before the markets closed. However, bond prices rose. Gilts opened up three ticks - 'a major bond rally in this market!' as one trader joked. The small gain was easily beaten by the long gilt future, which opened at 92.18 and closed at 92.24. Ten-year bonds climbed by 3/8 point. In France, trading was marginally more exciting. There was some sporadic buying interest in the March futures contract on Matif, which opened 13 basis points higher before slipping back to close at Monday's level of 104.96. The yield spread between German and French 10-year bonds (bunds are 200 basis points lower than OATs) led to some investors switching out of bunds into French bonds to find rich yield pickings. THE primary and secondary international bond markets slowed almost to a halt yesterday as securities houses concentrated on year-end paperwork. Prices on seasoned issues were barely changed, and there were no new issues reported. "
365,1989-12-19,1989-12-20,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Dow musters a recovery after early falls,"Wall Street CONTINUED selling of financial stocks and profit-taking on overpriced consumer non-cyclicals pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by around 30 points yesterday morning, but then the market rebounded to close a little lower, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow closed 1.92 points lower at 2,695.61 on active volume of 186m shares. It had dropped 42.02 points to 2,697.53 on Monday, partly because of concern about bank exposure to pockets of extreme weakness in the housing market. The Bank of New England said last Friday that it had seen a sharp rise in non-performing loans related to the north-east real estate market. That concern continued yesterday although Mr Robert Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, said that he was surprised by these fears and that investors did not appear to be differentiating between financial institutions with exposure and those with none. The heavy selling in the first 1 1/2 hours of the session yesterday reflected concern that Monday's plunge of more than 40 points could presage a more prolonged decline. According to Mr Newton Zinder, technical strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, that decline was the broadest since October 13 and that volume On Monday was the heaviest it has been since the dramatic recovery on October 16. However, the rebound yesterday from mid-morning lows was fairly convincing. Both the selling and the recovery appeared to happen in isolation to yesterday's news events. Those events included the release of the November consumer prices index which rose 0.4 per cent, slightly more than markets had expected and the release of November housing starts which fell 4.7 per cent, in line with forecasts. The Treasury bond market was on the defensive, albeit still trading in a narrow range, as the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee started its two-day meeting. There was no sign of any shift in monetary policy. The Fed did not operate in the money market with Fed Funds at 8 1/2 per cent. Short-dated issues were quoted 1/8 point lower. On the equity market, financial stocks hit the worst on Monday did better. The Bank of New England itself added Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 7 7/8 and Federal National Mortgage gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 . However, the Bank of New York fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 37 5/8 , NBD Bancorp dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 29 7/8 and First Wachovia lost Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 . Among money centre banks, Citicorp recoverd to close Dollars 1/8 higher at Dollars 126 7/8 and edged Dollars 1/4 higher to Dollars 32 1/8 . There was another important reversal of recent fortunes which was interesting. Consumer non-cyclicals, which have been favoured all year, lost out to industrial stocks which have increasingly begun to be regarded as undervalued in comparison. Philip Morris, one of the best performing stocks in the consumer sector, yesterday dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 3/8 and Coca-Cola, another favourite, fell Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 78 1/2 . By contrast, International Business Machines, which has been trading at its lowest level since 1983, yesterday jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 94 3/4 . Among other industrial stocks, International Paper added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 53 5/8 , Du Pont added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 124 1/8 and USX gained Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 34 3/4 . Walt Disney, which has been boosted all year by mergers speculation in the entertainment industry, fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 123 3/8 . AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 60 on a US press report that the company would pay Eastern Airlines as much as Dollars 500m for its Latin American routes and certain other assets of Texas Air, Eastern's parent. Canada BANKING issues and golds posted large declines in a day of sharp falls in Toronto. In active trading the composite index lost 42.74 to close at 3,915.80 as declines more than doubled advances, 498 to 241.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, met yesterday to discuss a possible discount rate cut. A cut would prompt a further reduction in bank prime lending rates, now 7.5 per cent. The administration had argued that a short, mild recession had bottomed out in the spring and that the economy had subsequently 'stalled'. But recent statistics have pointed to renewed contraction. Industrial output fell 0.4 per cent last month, a much sharper decline than expected. Employment fell by almost 250,000.

368,2009-04-29,2009-04-30,Financial Times,Banks cut back on overseas lending,"Loans down 5.4% in last quarter of 2008 US economy shrinks at annualised 6.1% Banks retreated from foreign lending at the fastest rate since records began 30 years ago in the final quarter of last year, the Bank for International Settlements said yesterday. The BIS report came as the Federal Reserve held policy unchanged at its April meeting, saying the ""economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting"". Meanwhile, new figures showed that US business investment collapsed in the first quarter of this year even as consumer spending grew again, with the economy overall contracting at an annualised rate of 6.1 per cent. The German government cut its forecast to predict a 6 per cent fall in GDP this year. The BIS data is the first to paint a comprehensive picture of the scramble to repatriate funds and reduce leverage amid the financial chaos of late 2008. In the space of just three months from October to December banks globally cut their portfolios of foreign loans by $1,800bn or 5.4 per cent after adjusting for exchange rate movements. The pullback represents the reversal of years of financial globalisation, fuelled by a sharp increase in so-called ""home bias"" as bankers tried to reduce risk while maintaining domestic lending to please the national governments that were acting as their guarantors of last resort. Sharp cutbacks in overseas lending have exacerbated the credit crunch by withdrawing a major source of funding, even as domestic lenders have been hit by the crisis. Almost all of the decline in foreign loans came from banks in western Europe, which had substantially expanded their cross-border lending in recent years. US and Japanese banks, which had not expanded their international lending as aggressively in the pre-crisis period, actually increased slightly their holdings of foreign assets in the quarter. The contraction in lending will compound fears that eastern European economies could face a shortage of credit, although the International Monetary Fund has enhanced capacity to fill the gap. The Fed's decision to stay on hold yesterday reflected a slight upgrade to its economic forecast. The central bank said the economy had ""continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower"". In recognition of the stock market rally, the Federal Open Market Committee removed from its statement a reference to the depressing effect of low stock prices on spending, but added that companies were cutting back on staffing, underscoring concern about fast-rising unemployment. For the first time, policymakers referred to the prospect that ""market forces"" would contribute to a gradual recovery, suggesting some greater confidence in the self-repairing capacity of the economy.

369,2009-04-29,2009-04-30,Financial Times,Rising bond yields present fresh challenge for the Fed,"News analysis Markets wait to see if the central bank will keep surprising them, writes Aline van Duyn After rising steadily in recent weeks, yields on US Treasuries have this week finally climbed back above the levels at which they were trading before the Federal Reserve started buying US debt a month ago. The ability of the Fed to balance the record amounts of new debt the US government has to sell - supply pressure that tends to raise interest rates - and its desire to keep interest rates low enough to spur fresh lending and mortgage financing continues to drive the Treasury market. Yields on 10-year US Treasury debt yesterday traded above 3 per cent, compared with a low of 2.54 per cent on March 18, just after the Fed announced it was planning to buy long-term debt. The 30-year US Treasury bond yield hit 3.92 per cent against the 3.8 per cent before quantitative easing was introduced. ""It's all about the market's testing the Fed's resolve to keep yields low,"" said Carl Lantz, interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse. ""The markets are waiting to see whether the Fed will keep surprising them in ways that could push yields lower."" Such surprises could involve bigger direct purchases or buying larger chunks of debt at once, he said. The $300bn Treasuries purchase plan announced at last month's federal open market committee meeting was the first time in decades the Fed had committed to buy long-term US debt. The amount might be increased, especially if pressure on yields continues to rise. The large initial impact of the move has been wiped out, partly because of concerns over the scale of the debt issuance needed to fund massive US fiscal stimulus and bank bail-out programmes. However, given the sharp rally in equity markets since early March - the S&P 500 index is up more than 25 per cent - yields would probably have risen much more without the Fed's intervention. Fed analysts suggested the $300bn purchase would reduce the yield on 10-year Treasuries by 25-35 basis points. Officials think the rate today is much lower than it would have been if they had not started buying. ""For yields to reverse their natural course, not only does the Fed have to step up purchase of long-term Treasuries and agencies but bond traders will have to be convinced that such actions are sufficient in capping bond yields,"" said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. He said the rise of the 10-year yield above 3 per cent ""signals bond traders' constant challenging of the Fed"". The importance of supply issues was clear in the 30-year yield's moves this week. The yield rose partly in anticipation of increased sales of 30-year bonds. Yesterday, the Fed said it would increase the frequency of its 30-year bond sales to monthly, part of a plan to meet an estimated $1,600bn to $2,700bn of new borrowing needs. Minutes of the meeting of the Treasury borrowing advisory committee showed that members discussed adding new maturities to the Treasury market. ""Several members stated that Treasury may need to consider this alternative but should begin with a second reopening of the 30-year bond and monitor developments in the long end of the curve,"" the minutes said."
370,2005-06-30,2005-07-01,Financial Times,Fed more confident as it increases rates again - QUARTER-POINT RISE.,"The Federal Reserve gave a more confident pronouncement on the growth outlook and again highlighted inflation concerns yesterday, raising interest rates another quarter-point to 3 1/4 per cent and signalling more to come. The policymaking Federal open market committee's closely watched language was unchanged as the committee agreed its ninth consecutive rate increase since it started raising rates the federal funds rate a year ago. In its accompanying statement, the Fed said that following its action, monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that the committee expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace - commonly taken to mean quarter-point increments. The central bank strongly suggested it would raise rates again at its August meeting, and gave no hint that it was considering a pause in its tightening campaign soon after that. ""Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the FOMC said. This was a slightly stronger statement on the growth outlook than at its May meeting, when the committee noted that spending growth had slowed somewhat. ""Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained,"" the committee said, maintaining its focus on inflation risks while implicitly acknowledging some better recent inflation data. In May, the statement had referred to inflation pressures that had picked up in recent months. ""The message was consistent with what we have heard from Fed speakers - that there are at least a few more rate increases to go,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""They did not want to encourage the view that they are almost done."" The stock, bond and currency markets offered only muted reactions to the statement. Futures markets anticipate a 3.75 per cent Fed funds rate at year-end. The low level of market-determined long-term interest rates, and the booming housing market, have added to the Fed's resolve to continue raising the federal funds rate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is below 4 per cent, compared with 4.7 per cent a year ago. Data published by the Commerce Department yesterday, before the Federal Reserve's announcement, showed US consumer spending was a little weaker than expected in May. Spending was flat on the previous month - compared with Wall Street forecasts of 0.1 per cent rise - while income growth also slowed. The core personal consumption expenditures index - the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy items - rose 0.2 per cent in May. In the 12 months to May, the core PCE index has risen 1.6 per cent, in line with the FOMC members' consensus forecast from earlier in the year: that core inflation would remain in a range of 1 1/2-1 3/4 per cent this year and next. Policymakers, who updated their forecasts at their two-day meeting, have said recently they expect growth to continue at the economy's trend rate, regardless of some recent weaker indicators, and in spite of the high oil price. While they will react to changes in the outlook, they are not overly concerned with volatility in the monthly data. "
371,2005-06-30,2005-07-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar hits 13-month highs vs sterling and euro.,"The dollar spiked to new highs on Friday as buoyant data on the US manufacturing sector added to expectations of more rate rises to come from the Federal Reserve. The greenback surged 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high of $1.1958 against the euro, breaking through a stubbornly defended technical barrier at $1.20, after trading flat for most of the week. The dollar also jumped 0.8 per cent to an 11-month high of Y111.64 against the yen - a week-on-week gain of 2.2 per cent - 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high of $1.7705 against sterling - a weekly rise of 2.9 per cent - and 1.4 per cent to C$1.2416 against the Canadian dollar. The dollar's spike was prompted by strong US data, with the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index rising to 53.8 in June, well above the breakeven 50 level, when the market had been braced for a repeat of May's 51.4 reading. Michigan's consumer sentiment index also trumped expectations. ""This shows that the weakest link in the economy is showing signs of improvement now,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. However, Mr Woolfolk was among those arguing that the underyling rationale for the dollar's renewed rally was Thursday's comments from the Federal open market committee. As widely expected, the FOMC raised rates to 3.25 per cent, its ninth straight quarter-point hike. But in its accompanying statement the committee said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. It added that ""expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" despite higher energy prices. The statement wrongfooted those who had been expecting signs of an imminent pause in tightening, with hawks such as Mr Woolfolk now arguing that US rates could rise to 4.25 per cent by the year-end. This contrasts sharply with a deteriorating yield environment elsewhere, particularly in the UK where speculation over a possible August rate cut intensified in the wake of this week's weak retail sales and economic growth data. With sterling-bears now anticipating two UK rate cuts by December, US rates could soon be higher than those in the UK for the first time since January 2001 - a daunting prospect for a currency that has largely owed its strength to a high underlying yield. ""Rate sentiment has turned around and may the Lord help sterling if rates cross over and are higher in the US. It would be goodnight London then,"" said David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC, who saw scope for the pound to fall to the low $1.60s. Against this backdrop, sterling fell 1.9 per cent over the week to GBP0.6751 against the euro, hitting a one-month low of GBP0.6798 yesterday, 0.7 per cent to Y197.67 against the yen and 1.3 per cent to SFr2.2940 versus the Swiss franc. This led Tony Norfield, global head of forex strategy at ABN Amro, to argue that most of the bad news for sterling was now priced in. Mr Norfield also drew solace from solid UK manufacturing data released yesterday which, he argued, indicated that sterling's slide from a high of $1.945 in December was already helping to ease the pressure on the UK's beleaguered manufacturers. High-yielding currencies in general performed poorly, with rising US rates leading to further unwinding of dollar-funded carry trades. The Australian dollar fell 2.4 per cent to $0.7516 against the greenback while the New Zealand dollar lost 3.1 per cent at $0.6834. Despite yesterday's slide against the dollar, the euro enjoyed a robust week, firming 1.2 per cent to Y133.53 against the yen, amid signs that the anti-euro sentiment unleashed by the failure of the EU's constitutional treaty was now abating. Yen weakness was prompted by the sharpest fall in Japan's trade surplus for four years - a trend likely to be exacerbated by rising oil prices - as well as claims that the yen was now supplanting the dollar as the funding currency of choice for carry trades. "
372,2005-06-30,2005-07-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Sterling hits new lows on widening yield gap.,"Sterling slumped to a near nine-month low against the US dollar in European morning trade on Friday after the Federal Reserve indicated it would continue hiking interest rates at a ""measured"" pace. This contrasts sharply with a deteriorating yield environment in the UK, where speculation over a possible August rate cut has intensified in the wake of weak retail sales and economic growth data this week. As widely expected, the Fed raised rates to 3.25 per cent overnight, its ninth straight quarter-point hike. In its accompanying statement, the Federal open market committee said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. The FOMC added that ""expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" despite higher energy prices. The statement wrongfooted those who had been expecting signs of an imminent pause in tightening, helping to send the dollar higher. ""The Fed has adopted a slightly more hawkish stance than in the previous policy statement. Clearly, the statement does not support a sooner than expected pause in rate hikes,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. This allowed the dollar to spike as high as $1.2026 to the euro, close to its recent highs, before falling back to $1.2092. The euro's recovery was aided by signs of hope from the struggling eurozone manufacturing sector. The sector's purchasing managers' index came in at 49.9 for June, just a whisker below breakeven, compared to 48.7 in May, with France and Italy leading the way. The greenback also rose to a fresh nine-month low of Y111.23 against the yen, again before falling back to Y110.87. However sterling bore the brunt of the fallout, tumbling 1.8c to $1.7726 against the dollar, before a modest recovery to $1.7816, 0.3p to GBP0.6783 against the euro, a one-month low, and Y0.75 to Y197.56 against the yen. The pound was little helped by a rise in the UK's manufacturing sector PMI, with the index recovering to 49.6 in June from a downwardly revised 47 in May. The sector thus remained in contraction for a third month. ""A rare piece of better than expected news on the manufacturing sector, with orders growing for the first time in three months as foreign demand improved. Nevertheless, the manufacturing sector is clearly still struggling and the case for an interest rate cut in August is now very strong,"" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight. ""Indeed, a move by the Bank of England as soon as July is looking increasingly possible given this week's data on GDP, retail sales and consumer confidence."" "

374,2006-12-12,2006-12-13,Financial Times,Oil price falls despite hint at output cut COMMODITIES.,"Oil prices rose sharply in early trade yesterday before tomorrow's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries before closing down on the day.  Opec ministers said on arrival in the Nigerian capital of Abuja that a further cut of 500,000 barrels a day could be made on top of the 1.2m b/d cut announced in November.  ICE Brent crude for January delivery had added 51 cents but closed down 32 cents at to Dollars 61.52 a barrel. January West Texas Intermediate had added 66 cents but settled at Dollars 61.02 a barrel, down 20 cents on the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The US Department of Energy has left unchanged its projection that world oil demand will increase by 1.5m barrels a day in 2007. In its latest monthly forecast, it said US petroleum consumption was expected to rise by 300,000 b/d in 2007, following relatively flat consumption in 2006. The US and China are projected to account for more than half of the world growth in oil consumption in 2007. Demand growth is projected to be strong in the Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries.

The proposed merger between the Intercontinental Exchange, the electronic commodities exchange, and the New York Board of Trade, the soft commodity exchange, took a step closer this week when Nybot members overwhelmingly approved the deal.  Nybot said 93 per cent voted in favour of the transaction. ICE agreed to buy Nybot last September for about Dollars 1bn in cash and stock. Monday's vote went ahead in spite of a lawsuit filed last week against Nybot in New York State Supreme Court by so-called ""permit holders"" of the exchange who were barred from voting on the deal.

376,2009-08-12,2009-08-13,Financial Times,Citigroup leads way in strong rebound for financial sector,"wall street US stocks bounced yesterday, recovering most of the previous day's losses as buyers were tempted back into the market following two days of falls. Financial stocks were heavily bought after dragging the market lower on Tuesday. Citigroup , shares in which have been volatile recently, shedding over 6 per cent on Tuesday following a 20 per cent surge over the previous seven sessions, gained 7.9 per cent to $3.98. Wells Fargo advanced 1 per cent to $27.17 and JPMorgan rose 2.4 per cent to $42.21. Bank of New York Mellon was also higher after it announced its plans to buy Insight Investment Management from Lloyds bank. BNY Mellon's shares picked up 2.3 per cent to $28.71. Insurer Allstate was one of the steepest climbers in the financial sector, rising 6.3 per cent to $28.42 after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, saying the company's fundamentals remained strong and that the shares were undervalued following recent falls. Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity ""levelling out"" saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close. ""The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,"" said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, said: ""I think 'levelling out' confused the market a little bit, and it points to a divided Fed."" The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,005.81 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,361.61 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,998.72. ""We may be in for some bouncing around as investors decide whether to trust in the recovery and take the plunge into equities,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. Homebuilders were especially strong after Toll Brothers , which builds luxury houses, said cancellations fell and orders rose during the previous quarter, although it added that its units were selling for cheaper prices. Toll Brothers ' shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $23.42 and gave a boost to others in the sector. DR Horton gained 2.6 per cent to $13.45, while Lennar rose 4 per cent to $13.52. There was some optimism on consumer activity after department store Macy's kicked off the retailers' earnings season by beating earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast. The shares were volatile, however, with some concern over the company's warning of a ""very difficult"" trading environment as well as the fact its forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations. After a brief fall during the pre-market session, the shares rose 6 per cent to $16.40 during the day. Shares in Sara Lee also bounced around after the company made a narrower loss than expected after one-off charges. There was strength in North American sales, which helped boost the shares before the bell, but they subsequently fell and finished 10 per cent down at $9.72. Meanwhile, Applied Materials , which produces equipment to make microchips, reported a narrower loss than predicted on relatively strong sales. Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $13.66. The IPO market has shown signs of life in the past few days, culminating yesterday with what is likely to become the biggest US offering this year from Starwood Property Trust . The trust, which will invest in real estate, offered its shares at $20 and held on to that to close the day unchanged. But Emdeon , a healthcare services company, jumped on its first day of trade and the shares, which were priced at $15.50, climbed6.6 per cent to $16.52. Imax , the cinema chain that shows films in 3D, entered the market on Tuesday priced on the Nasdaq at $8.50. Strong buying during the day saw the shares rise to $9.11 and they continued to build on that yesterday, strengthening 1.5 per cent to $9.25."

381,2006-05-10,2006-05-11,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar gains after China let off hook.,"The under-fire US dollar staged a modest recovery in European morning trade on Thursday after the US Treasury stepped back from the brink of formally branding China a currency cheat. The Treasury was happy to use aggressive language to describe Beijing's currency policy in its semi-annual foreign exchange report, saying it was ""extremely dissatisfied"" with the pace of reform and that it will continue to ""actively and frankly press China to quicken the pace of renminbi flexibility"". However the Treasury stopped short of formally naming China as a ""currency manipulator"", a move that many in the market believe would have applied more pressure on Beijing to allow the renminbi to appreciate, potentially causing the dollar to weaken against the full range of Asian, and even European, currencies. With this eventuality unforthcoming and the Federal Open Market Committee, which raised rates by 25 basis points to 5 per cent on Wednesday, signalling that ""some further tightening may yet be needed to address inflation risks"", the dollar was able to enjoy a modest reprieve, firming to $1.2713 against the euro, from a fresh 12-month low of $1.2831 it hit prior to the release of the Treasury's report. The greenback also recovered to SFr 1.2271against the Swiss franc, from a one-year low of SFr1.2128, Y111.24 against the yen, from Wednesday's eight-month nadir of Y110.11 and C$1.1056 against the Canadian dollar, having hit a 28-year low of C$1.0980 on Wednesday. ""The failure of the FOMC to indicate more clearly the possibility of a pause at the next meeting on 29 June and the failure of the US Treasury department to cite China as a currency manipulator has helped stabilise dollar sentiment,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. However, Mr Halpenny was among those arguing that the dollar's respite may be short-lived, with the forces pressuring it lower, such as a declining yield advantage and mounting worries over the US external deficit, likely to reassert themselves. ""The point is that nothing significant has changed,"" he said. ""It seems premature at this point to expect a sustained dollar rally against any of the major currencies."" Others pointed out that despite the broadly hawkish Fed statement, the futures market was still only pricing in a 40 per cent probability of a June rate hike. Elsewhere sterling was strong, holding steady at $1.8674 to the dollar and firming 0.45p to GBP0.6809 against the euro, 2 centimes to SFr2.2910 against the Swiss franc and Y1.75 to Y207.74 against the yen, as both UK industrial and manufacturing output rose 0.7 per cent month-on-month in March, outstripping forecasts for rises of 0.2 per cent in both cases. The 0.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise in industrial production was the strongest since 1999, helping support forecasts that the next move in UK interest rates will be upward. Kuwait revalued the dinar by 1 per cent to KD0.2891 to the dollar, its first rise for 16 months. The move is likely to put pressure on other major oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia to follow suit. "
382,2000-10-03,2000-10-04,Financial Times,WORLD NEWS - US &CANADA - Fed leaves rates unchanged.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at its last scheduled policy meeting before the US presidential election - but warned that rising energy prices risked raising inflation expectations. In a widely expected decision, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee held the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at a nine-year high of 6.5 per cent. It was the third successive meeting that Fed policymakers voted for no change in rates, after deciding on a 0.5 percentage point increase in May. In its statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said recent figures had indicated a moderation in the expansion of demand to a pace closer to that of the economy's potential rate of growth. More rapid advances in productivity continued to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures, it said. But it repeated previous warnings that demand on the pool of available workers was at an unusually high level. And for the first time it sounded a warning about high oil prices. ""The increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date, poses a risk of raising inflation expectations,"" the statement said. However, inflation expectations to date remained subdued. Also as expected, the central bank maintained its bias towards future policy tightening, declaring that ""the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future"". The FOMC vote was accompanied by a report from the US Commerce department showing sales of one-family homes fell 3 per cent in August. A report from the Conference Board, a New York-based business research firm, also showed its index of leading economic indicators, a barometer of future growth, fell for the third time in four months in August. On Monday, a monthly survey of purchasing executives found that manufacturing activity, representing one-fifth of the US economy, shrank for the second straight month in September. The continuing signs of a slowdown have sharply raised market odds of a Fed rate cut early next year. Trading of Fed funds futures contracts suggests speculators see a 50 per cent chance a Fed easing by next spring. But the Fed continues to voice concerns about energy prices, the trade deficit and the tight labour market - symptoms of imbalances it believes reflect an economy that continues to grow beyond its means. Fed rate increases and rising oil prices can take several months to filter through the economy, so the impact of the rate increase in May and the rise over the past year in energy prices have yet to be fully realised. The open market committee meets again on November 15 and December 19. "
383,1998-08-18,1998-08-19,Financial Times,Fed committee leaves interest rates unchanged.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday after the regular private meeting of its main policy-setting committee as consumer price inflation figures for July showed price rises continuing subdued. The Federal Open Market Committee's decision was widely anticipated. The Fed has not changed interest rates since March last year, when the benchmark overnight loan rate to banks was raised a quarter point to 5.5%. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in July, after adjustment for seasonal variations, following a 0.1% rise in June. The rate in the year to July was unchanged on the previous month at 1.7%. The core rate, minus the volatile food and energy components, also rose 0.2% in July against 0.1% in the prior month. Breaking down the figures, vehicle prices rose 0.4%, reflecting in part a shortage arising out of the General Motors strike, while a 3.2% rise in airline fares contributed to a 0.3% increase in transportation prices. On the other hand, clothing prices dropped by 0.3%. Figures released yesterday also showed an unexpected drop in the US trade deficit in June. The US registered a $14.2bn trade deficit in goods and services in June, compared with $15.5bn in May. This was largely the result of a surprise 2% fall in imports which more than offset a 0.5% decline in exports. However, the deficit for the second quarter was a record $44bn, reflecting in part the consequence of Asia's financial crisis. Ed Yardeni, an economist with Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said US exports were now falling at their fastest pace since the current measurements began in 1986. William Daley, commerce secretary, said the figures showed US exports in the first half of the year had edged up by only 1%, but they had grown ""a remarkable"" 7% once Asia was excluded. Economists doubted the June improvement in the deficit would be more than temporary. Tim O'Neill, chief economist for Harris Bank, said exports would remain under downward pressure because of the strong dollar and the weak Asian economies, while the decline in imports could partly reflect problems east Asian economies are facing in securing trade financing. ""With exports expected to remain weak and imports resuming their upward trend, the US trade balance should deteriorate in coming months, tempering the strength in the economy. This negative impact on GDP growth, alongside past appreciation of the US dollar and weak commodity prices, has contributed to inflation staying low despite a tight labour market,"" he said. Canadian trade surplus rises A sharp drop in car part imports, a result of the General Motors strike, led to a 16% increase in Canada's merchandise trade surplus in June, Scott Morrison reports from Toronto. Canada yesterday said its trade balance in June stood at C$1.5bn ($1bn), up C$213m from May. It was the second consecutive monthly increase in the balance. June imports dropped 0.8% from May to C$24.5bn as the GM strike led to plant closures in Canada. Exports inched up 0.1% to C$26bn. A 7.4% plunge in car product exports negated a strong performance in exports of industrial goods, as well as machinery and equipment. Despite the small gain in exports in June, the trend was flat for the second quarter after a slight decline during the first three months. Statistics Canada said there had been no growth in Canadian exports since the start of the year. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "

385,1998-08-18,1998-08-19,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Signs seen of switch from gilts to shares.,"Prices were weaker yesterday as some of the worry over Russia's financial and political crisis dissipated and US Treasuries opened lower. Inflation data released in the UK and US were within expectations, ensuring no significant price moves in markets already thin due to the holiday period. In the UK, dealers spotted signs of asset switching into equities from gilts but globally there was still solid support for bonds. US TREASURIES ended lower but off their worst losses of the day as US equities rallied and the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down 3/16 to 99 5/32, yielding 5.558%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note was down 5/32 to 101 19/32, yielding 5.411% and the two-year note was 1/32 lower at 100 1/16, yielding 5.339%. ""A lot of the flight to quality seems to have been removed from the market but it's a day-to-day thing,"" said Terrence Pigott, head of government bond trading at Daiwa Securities America. Data releases showed the US trade deficit to have narrowed to $14.2bn in June from $15.5bn in May and consumer prices to have risen 0.2% in July. GERMAN BUNDS ended lower but dealers say they are expecting prices to continue recent rises, with a yield on the benchmark bund of 4.25% feasible in the short term. Yesterday, it stood at 4.42%. However, Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko said that target would only be reached if the Bundesbank maintained its current interest rate stance. ""You can only be confident holding bunds as long as a rate rise is off the agenda. But today's Bundesbank report left open the possibility of a pre-Christmas rate rise,"" he said. The bank yesterday released its August monthly report on the economy. The September 10-year bund future settled 0.03 points lower at 111.10 in volume of 449,000 contracts traded in Frankfurt. The UK GILTS market was unimpressed by inflation data, which traders said reinforced the view that interest rates had peaked. Gilt futures ended lower after trading in narrow ranges. September 10-year futures settled down 0.07 points at 110.19 in trading volume of 52,000 contracts. The underlying rate of UK inflation fell to 2.6% in July, which is above the Bank of England's year-end target of 2.5%. Neil Parker, Treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said gilts had sold off because some investors had been over-optimistic that the inflation target would be met. July retail sales data are due today. The spread between the benchmark contracts in the gilt and bund markets narrowed by one basis point to 124 points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

386,1998-11-17,1998-11-18,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Fed may rest axe for a while.,"THE AMERICAS - Fed may rest axe for a while - Further interest rate cuts may wait until the new year, reports Stephen Fidler. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday for the third time in seven weeks, but strongly suggested that a further reduction would have to wait until at least the new year. The statement accompanying the decision made yesterday by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to reduce both the federal funds and discount rates by a quarter point indicated the Fed believed it had gone far enough for now to stabilise financial markets. In repeated public statements, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has expressed his concerns about what he has described as the ""extreme risk aversion"" that developed since late August in US financial markets. ""Although conditions in financial markets have settled down materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain,"" the statement said. But it added: ""With the 75-basis-point decline in the federal funds rate since September, financial conditions can reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion while keeping inflationary pressures subdued."" Economists said that, assuming financial markets continued to stabilise, the Fed would wait to see the impact of the rate reductions on the real economy. ""I think they sent a pretty clear signal that they are now in pause mode,"" said Sassan Ghahramani, managing director at Medley Global Advisors in New York. Fed thinking appeared to be ""shifting away from credit dislocation concerns and towards the real economy"", said John Maguire of Medley. William Dudley, director of US economic research at Goldman Sachs in New York, described yesterday's move as ""a sort of insurance that they have done enough for the time being"", which carried little risk because inflation pressures remain subdued. He said he did not expect any further reduction to take place at the next meeting of the FOMC in December, but another drop was likely in the spring, when weakness in the US economy would start to influence Fed thinking. However, it is also clear from the Fed statement that the central bank does not believe the stresses in the financial markets are necessarily resolved. One indicator which Mr Greenspan has cited - the unusually wide liquidity premium that developed in September and October between the most recently issued ""on-the-run"" US Treasury bonds and less frequently traded bonds - has narrowed. Credit risk spreads - the interest rate premium paid by riskier borrowers - have also subsided, though not to the perhaps exaggeratedly low levels that existed earlier in the year. However, there are areas of lingering difficulty. One such, said Mr Dudley at Goldman Sachs, was the US commercial paper market, where most large US companies obtain short-term financing. The highest rated borrowers - ranked A1-P1 by the main US credit rating agencies - can now borrow in the market significantly more cheaply than their lesser-rated counterparts. The spread between A1-P1 borrowers and A2-P2 borrowers is now about 95 basis points, three times higher than normal levels. Moreover, many of the lesser-rated borrowers could not gain access to commercial paper finance over the year-end, leading them to turn to their banks, where they have back-up lines of credit. As a result, the commercial paper market for A2-P2 borrowers has shrunk from $103.9bn to $89.7bn ( #53.3bn) in just eight weeks, he said. ""I would expect the capital market turmoil to subside with the exception of the commercial paper market where you will have problems until the year-end,"" he said. However, where the strains have eased, they have done so almost as rapidly as they emerged. As a result, the Fed is viewed as not being confident that they have disappeared for good. Inflation remains subdued Inflation in the US economy remained tame in October in spite of a jump in petrol prices, the Labour Department said, Reuters reports from Washington. The Consumer Price Index, the government's main inflation gauge, rose 0.2% after remaining flat in September. The closely watched core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose by 0.2% last month after an identical rise in September. In the year ended in October, the CPI overall was up 1.5%. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
387,1998-11-17,1998-11-18,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Rate cut pushes Treasuries higher.,"US Treasury prices pushed higher soon after the announcment that the Federal Reserve had again cut US interest rates. Prices were already higher before the Federal Open Market Committee announced it was to cut the key Federal funds and discount rates by 25 basis points each, and European markets had also ended up on hopes of a further easing. In the minutes after the rate cut announcement, the 30-year Treasury bond, the benchmark for US interest rates, was 1/4 higher at 99 21/32, sending the yield lower to 5.273%. Among shorter-term issues, the 10-year note was up 15/32 to 99 9/16, yielding 4.806%, while the two-year note was up 3/16 to 99 1/8, yielding 4.472%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from its early lows on the rate cut news. ""The bill sector and the two-year note rallied most, but the long end is not reacting that positively,"" said Richard Gilhooly, international bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, economists and analysts were divided in their expectations. Economists, seeing signs of slowing US domestic growth, had overwhelmingly expected another rate cut. Market analysts and traders were less convinced a cut was coming, because of the strong rebound seen in global financial markets since the Fed first began easing monetary policy in late September. The most recent rate cut, which came by surprise in mid-October, triggered a sharp rally in stocks and bonds soon after. European government bond markets had closed higher in thin trading ahead of the FOMC announcement in anticipation of a reduction. They were helped additionally by further good news on European inflation, especially in the UK, where the annual rate hit the 2.5% target for the third consecutive month. It remains to be seen whether this, combined with the Fed move, will convince the Bank of England to cut UK rates again next month - some market watchers believe there may be no further easing of UK monetary policy until next year - but it was enough in the short term to give a fillip to UK gilts. The December contract on Liffe settled 0.34 higher at 115.49 in light futures trading, while the cash market got a boost from the repayment of nearly #8bn of debt, further limiting the supply of gilts. The Debt Management Office also said it was to auction #450m of index-linked gilts next week, the first time an index-linked issue would be available for several years. German bunds marked time along with other European markets, although there is now a widespread acceptance that, unlike in the US, interest rates will probably not decline before the year end and that interest rates in the eurozone countries will converge at 3.3% when the European single currency is launched in January. The December future settled 0.21 higher at 112.59, while Italian and Spanish bonds also moved marginally higher. Yields on Japanese government bonds fell slightly in Tokyo trading as prices rose despite a move by Moody's Investors Service to deprive Japan of its triple-A rating. The agency cut the country's sovereign rating by one notch, from Aaa to Aa1, a step that had been widely anticipated. Russia's debt market was unaffected by the general mood of anticiapation of the FOMC decision, and staged a small rally, taking its cue from a strong performance the previous day by other emerging debt markets. Principal Notes (PRINs) rose 1 1/4 to 7 1/4 and Interest Arrears Notes (IANs) were up 1 1/2 to 8 1/2 in afternoon trading, although there was no firm direction to the market's trend. Analysts said hopes were rising that Russia would pay all or some of its $407m debt in PRINs and $205m in IANs, which are due next month. Richard Gray, at Bank of America, said that it was in Russia's interest to do so in order to avoid a formal default on the $26bn debt that it owes to its London Club of commercial bank creditors. Other emerging debt was also quiet on the view that no rate cut from the Fed would be bad news for the Brady bond market, but prices remained firm. However, Mexican and Venezuelan paper was affected by the volatility in oil prices, which have begun to ease after the sudden end to the confrontation with Iraq.

388,1989-10-03,1989-10-04,Financial Times,Government Bonds: US Treasuries make gains on back of firmer dollar,"US TREASURY bonds moved higher yesterday in reaction to a stronger dollar and to remarks from a senior Administration official saying that US interest rates were heading down. In late trading, short-dated issues were as much as 1/4 point higher, while the Treasury's benchmark long bond was quoted 1/2 point up for a yield of 8.17 per cent. The US currency put in a strong performance overnight and dipped only temporarily under the weight of more concerted central bank intervention. In late New York trading, the dollar was steady, near to its day's highs at Y141.15 and DM1.8865. Foreign exchange dealers said that the impact of central bank intervention against the dollar appeared to be diminishing and that the currency remained well bid. The rally in New York appeared to be partly on reports of a possible attempted coup in Panama. The dollar's resilient performance has provided significant support for the bond market which has tended to ignore unfavourable news when the US currency is rising. Yesterday, the short end of the market was bolstered by reported remarks from Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, that interest rates would decline. The desire of the Administration to see lower interest rates is well known on Wall Street and the US Federal Reserve appears to be under some pressure to ease monetary policy. However, given some evidence that the economy is not now slowing as much as it was, it is not at all clear that the Fed, whose Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, will be prepared to lower rates. The September US purchasing managers' report showed that the economy slowed at a lower rate last month than in August and yesterday offered news of a healthy 2.9 per cent rise in new factory orders in August compared with a revised fall of 2 per cent in July. THE New Zealand government bond market reacted badly to the troubles at DFC New Zealand. The benchmark 1993 bond rose by 12 basis points to yield 12.44, up from 12.32 on Monday, as news of the possible bankruptcy came through to the trading floor. Short maturities had an early slip of about 15 basis points in price, and the currency also weakened. THE GERMAN government bond market opened slightly weaker, but made steady small gains during the day after rates were fixed 25 pfennigs higher on the previous day. There were, however, no calls from leading investors. The market has now convinced itself that Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank will result in a 1/2 point rise in interest rates and made the necessary adjustments. THE UK gilt market failed to react to the release of the underlying reserves figures, which showed an unexpectedly small reduction of Pounds 142m in September. Given the Bank of England's interventions in the foreign exchange markets, the market was predicting a bigger decline. 'The market responded by standing still,' said a dealer. The futures market traded within a 1/4 point range, the long gilt closing at 92.24 per cent, from 92.21 on Monday. The cash market was even quieter and closed unchanged. "
389,1989-10-03,1989-10-04,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Strong dollar helps propel Dow to an all-time peak,"WALL STREET THE COMBINATION of a strong dollar, a rally in bonds and the rebound on Monday in the stock market triggered significant institutional buying of equities yesterday which boosted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record closing high, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow rose steadily throughout the session to end 40.84 points higher at 2,754.56, compared with the previous all-time closing high on September 1 of 2,752.09. Volume was active, with 182.5m shares traded compared with Monday's total of only 127m. The background to yesterday's continued buying included another strong performance by the dollar and modest gains in the bond market. The US currency strengthened considerably in the Far East overnight and proved resilient in the face of more concerted central bank intervention. In New York, the US currency was given an additional boost by reports that General Manuel Noriega had been taken into custody in a coup in Panama. The bond market was helped by the strength of the dollar and by reports of a remark by Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, that interest rates were headed downwards. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday. The Fed is seen as having little domestic economic justification for lowering interest rates at this stage. The US purchasing managers' report for September showed growth slowing less markedly than in August and yesterday there were figures showing a hefty 2.9 per cent rise in new factory orders in August. Another factor in the equities rally was the gain of 20.89 points achieved on Monday - a better performance than many had anticipated at the beginning of a new quarter. In spite of the substantial gain yesterday, however, there are some worrying signs about the long-term health of this week's advance. One of the most obvious is the disappointing performance of IBM, a benchmark stock, which fell to its lowest level for a year. One of several companies which have warned that third quarter profits will be disappointing, IBM fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 105 3/4 . Equity analysts noted that buying of blue chips was concentrated in those issues which are not expected to report disappointing earnings for the third quarter. IBM's performance was in marked contrast to other blue chips. Philip Morris, for example, piled on Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 171 7/8 . Among featured individual stocks, Boeing rose Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 , apparently on hopes that the machinists' union would vote to avert a strike due to start at midnight last night. Harley-Davidson surged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 after investor Mr Malcolm Glazer said that he and members of his family might seek control of the company. On the over-the-counter market, McCaw Cellular A shares rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 1/2 after the company agreed to buy Metromedia's interest in the New York city cellular franchise and to sell cellular interests in three south-eastern states to Contel Cellular. LIN Broadcasting, which has a right of first refusal on the Metromedia stake, fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 108 1/2 and Contel's A shares added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 26. CANADA ACTIVE trading saw Toronto share prices make strong gains. The composite index closed up 39.2 at 4,011.9 on volume of 34m shares, compared with Monday's volume of 22m shares. Advances outnumbered declines by 413 to 292 and trading value was CDollars 409m compared with CDollars 247m on Monday. Polymer International was up CDollars 2 5/8 at CDollars 11 5/8 . Intertape Systems plans a CDollars 12-a-share offer for the 27 per cent of Polymer it does not already own. "
390,1998-09-29,1998-09-30,Financial Times,COMMODITIES &AGRICULTURE - Oil eases as US facilities restart.,"Oil prices softened yesterday because of a combination of weak technical factors and a resumption of operations at some of the US oil facilities that had been shut down in advance of Hurricane Georges. The bellwether Brent Blend futures contract for November delivery was quoted at $14.31 in late trading on London's International Petroleum Exchange, down 4 cents on Monday's close. Traders said the crude markets were also seeking a new direction from the latest weekly inventory data due to be published last night by the American Petroleum Institute. Gold traded cautiously, yesterday, with the market lacking firm direction ahead of the outcome the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The precious metal has rallied in recent days on indications that the FOMC is likely to cut US interest rates. The afternoon price ""fix"" in London was $296 an ounce, slightly down on the morning's fix of $296.85 but up on Monday afternoon's level of $292.25. Later in Europe, gold was quoted at $297. Among base metals, only nickel showed any signs of movement in a quiet day on the London Metal Exchange. Nickel for delivery in three months closed at $4,125 a tonne, up $35 on Monday's close. On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, robusta coffee futures fell, the benchmark November contract closing down $23 at $1,660 a tonne.

391,1998-09-29,1998-09-30,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Footsie rallies as SmallCap dips below 2,000.","A day-long jousting session with the 5,100 level ended with the FTSE 100 index, the London market's leading benchmark, finishing marginally ahead, up 15.2 at 5,108.7. At its worst level of the day, within 30 minutes of the opening, the FTSE 100 posted a low of 5,042.7, down more than 50 points. The market's smaller capitalised stocks delivered another worryingly weak performance. The FTSE SmallCap index dropped below the 2,000 mark for the first time since January 19 1996, and is now 28.5% down from its May 26 peak of 2,793.8. The market's extremely nervous performance came before the outcome of the regular meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee in Washington yesterday. A decision from the committee was due shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers in London said the market had behaved reasonably well in front of what was seen as the most crucial FOMC meeting for many months. ""Everyone I've spoken to expects the Fed to cut, but no one is confident about the extent of the cut,"" said one marketmaker. He said the market would take a minimum 25 basis points reduction as read and warned that many had already factored in a 50 basis points reduction. The general view around the stock market was that Wall Street, and therefore London and the rest of global markets, would probably hold or absorb small profit-taking in the event of a 25 basis points cut and would respond positively to a 50 basis points cut. But ominously, many said the market would give a ready and negative response to the Fed leaving rates on hold in the short term. Others said the market would probably run into further pockets of turbulence as the third quarter came to a close and the last quarter, traditionally one of the most volatile of the year, kicked off. There remains a widespread view that London still has to face a further sizeable sell-off, which many expect to drive the FTSE 100 lower before the year-end. That dip would be triggered by further profit downgrades and even more turmoil in other world markets. Those dire predictions would be made even worse by any further failures of hedge funds, after the shock of the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. The erratic behaviour of the FTSE 100 was not mirrored by the second-line stocks, represented by the FTSE 250, which stayed in positive ground all day, eventually closing the session a net 9.0 ahead at 4,562.0. The midcap index was bolstered by some encouraging corporate news from, among others, Business Post and Booker, both of which made rapid gains; the former by evidence of directors buying shares in the company and the latter after the appointment of a new chairman and chief executive who are both highly rated in the City. Turnover in equities reached 970.1m shares by the 6pm count, with FTSE 100 constituents accounting for just over half the overall total. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

For at best, finance ministers will go home with assurances that the IMF will step in with a credit line for Brazil along with an IMF programme requiring tough austerity measures to reduce the country's enormous deficit. Markets across the region saw trade slow to a trickle ahead of the US federal open market committee's decision on interest rates. In SAO PAULO the Bovespa index edged 23 points higher to 6,850 at midsession. Analysts noted, however, that equity investors continued to be concerned over a renewed wave of capital flight. Some $739m was reported to have left the country's foreign exchange markets on Monday, the biggest dollar outflow for two weeks. More than $30bn has left Brazil since the start of August.

393,1998-09-29,1998-09-30,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Dow drops after cut in interest rates.,"US shares plunged soon after the Federal open market committee announced a quarter-point cut in the key Federal Funds rate, writes John Labate in New York. The interest rate cut was widely expected but many in the market had hoped for a stronger half-point cut. Stocks were generally calm ahead of the mid-afternoon announcement, with the three main indices rising by midday. Some speculated that the Fed could ease rates again at its next meeting in mid-Novemeber. Immediate investor reaction to the Fed move was sharp, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 80 points soon after the committee's decision. By mid-afternoon, the market had recovered a bit. The Dow was down 49.95 to 8,058.89 while the Standard &Poor's 500 fell 3.42 to 1,045.27. The Nasdaq composite lost 10.06 to 1,729.16, and the Russell 2,000 index of small-cap shares fell 3.88 or more than 1% to 364.13. Two high profile stocks put a drag on sentiment. Shares of Viacom, the entertainment company, plunged more than 14% or $9 1/16 to $53 7/8 after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Merrill Lynch lowered their ratings. Goodyear Tire dipped $4 1/8 or more than 7% to $51 5/8 after the company lowered expectations of third-quarter earnings and announced a round of job cuts. Shares of Cendant fell more than 4% or $9/16 to $12 11/16 after the company restated its results back to 1995. Gillette, the global consumer products company, fell $2 or more than 5% to $37 11/16 after J.P. Morgan cut its rating. Retail stocks weakened with Federated Department Stores down $1 5/8 to $37 after BT Alex Brown cut its rating to ""market performer"". Wal-Mart lost $2 9/16 to $58 7/8 despite a raised rating by the same firm. US Treasuries were mixed ahead of the Fed announcement, with volatility picking up after the announced rate cut. The benchmark long bond rose 13/32 to 105 29/32, yielding 5.112%. In the telecoms sector, Bell Atlantic rose $1 3/8 to $49 after it announced a restructuring and analysts at Dresdner rated the company a ""buy"". BellSouth also rose strongly, up $3 7/16 or more than 4% to $76 1/8. TORONTO edged lower at midsession as investors played a wait-and-see game ahead of the Federal open market committee meeting. The TSE-300 composite index was 23.18 lower by midday at 5,846.10 in weak volume. During morning trade, seven of the 14 market sub-indices were in negative territory, led by weakness in the transportation sector. In that group, Air Canada lost 35 cents to C$5.75. Banking issues overcame early weakness as the market awaited the Fed announcement. Royal Bank of Canada edged 30 cents higher to C$63.10. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

394,1998-09-29,1998-09-30,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar volatile after Fed decision.,"The US Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to make a small cut in the Fed Funds interest rate left the foreign exchange market disappointed. The market had priced in a cut by as much as half of one percentage point, based on short-dated interest rate future contracts. But the Fed's decision to cut the official rate by just 0.25 percentage points, and to leave the discount rate untouched, caused the dollar to gyrate wildly as traders weighed up the options. In a statement, the central bank's open markets committee said: ""The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in the United States, of increasing weakness in foreign economies, and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically."" It was the first time the Fed had cut rates since January 1996. Marc Chandler, foreign exchange analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said: ""In March 1997, when the Fed last raised rates, they said it was cautionary tap on the brake. This was a cautionary tap on the accelerator. ""This will not be enough to satisfy the markets. Many people think the Fed is falling behind the deflation curve."" But Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at J.P. Morgan in London, said the decision not to move the discount rate was an warning to the markets. ""It is very important that the discount rate was not cut - that would have sent a signal that the Fed was erring on the side of further cuts to come,"" Mr Persaud said. ""The Fed is signalling that it is concerned about the international economy. But speculation has been subdued by keeping the discount rate unchanged."" ""A 25 basis point cut was the most likely size of the move, given the US Fed is walking in uncertain territory, with the dichotomy between the international and domestic economy."" Earlier in London, trading had been very subdued as the market awaited the Fed's decision. The dollar had closed at DM 1.678 against the D-Mark, little changed from the previous day. Against the yen it was Y 2.4 weaker, at Y 134. * The US may have cut interest rates. But this does not mean that investors should expect co-ordinated G7 action. When Alan Greenspan earlier this month warned of the risk that international turmoil posed, the Bundesbank waited a day to say that Germany would not cut interest rates - even if the US did. This time round, the Bundesbank got its retaliation in first. Juergen Stark, the bank's vice-president, made clear that there was ""no necessity to discuss"" lower interest rates in Germany or the core countries of the euro-zone, before the FOMC met, indeed before the US was even awake. ""At the moment in Europe we have historically low rates,"" he said. And that was the end of the matter. * There is more hope of a cut when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee decides on interest rates on October 8. Following September's meeting, many analysts thought the MPC mirrored Chairman Greenspan's words that the balance of risks was moving away from domestically-generated inflation to disinflation imported from a turbulent international economy. The MPC kept interest rates on hold at 7.5% last month. But it signalled that the the next move would be down. Now the Fed has taken the plunge, lower UK rates cannot be far off. * The most likely beneficiary of China's decision to repatriate foreign exchange holdings back into the renminbi is the beleaguered Hong Kong dollar. It followed the earlier announcement of foreign exchange controls. While most analysts expect the direct consequences of the move to be small, it may allow the Chinese government to lower domestic interest rates. That would help domestic demand and ease the pressure on the Hong Kong economy. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
395,1998-09-29,1998-09-30,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Long bond jumps after Fed easing.,"US Treasuries were mixed soon after the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to lower the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%. The 30-year bond, the benchmark for long-term interest rates, jumped 13/32 to 105 29/32, sending the yield down to 5.112%. Shorter-term notes did not do as well. The 10-year note was unchanged at 107, yielding 4.591%. The two-year note was down 1/32 to 100 3/32, yielding 4.45%. The fall in the Fed funds rate was widely expected in the stock and bond markets, coming after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress last week. Many in the market, however, had expected a more aggressive move. ""The general assumption is that the next move will come at the November meeting,"" said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson in New York. The cut was seen as important in stabilising global investment and helping overseas economies. While the US economy remains strong, recent cuts in credit availability, as well as problems at large financial institutions, are seen as a threat to future growth. GERMAN BUNDS closed slightly higher awaiting news from the US. German interest rates will come under the spotlight tomorrow when the Bundesbank council meets, but a hint that it would not adjust German rates came when Juergen Stark, a vice-president, said there was no justification for a relaxation of monetary policy in core euro zone countries. The December bund future settled at 113.73, up 0.12, with just 247,000 contracts changing hands in quiet trading on Eurex. In the cash market, the yield on the 10-year bund was 3.95%. UK GILTS, extremely sensitive to sentiment on interest rates ahead of next week's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, fell in quiet trading while sterling strengthened. The catalyst for both was evidence of continued robust consumer spending, which weakens the case for a cut in rates. The figures showed consumers borrowed an additional #1.4bn in August, higher than most observers had expected. Neil Parker, treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the data ""may add some ammunition to the hawks' case for leaving rates on hold"" at next week's meeting. ""Consumers are clearly financing consumption with debt, which raises questions about the timetable for interest rate cuts,"" said Joanne Collins at Daiwa Europe. The December gilt future settled at 115.36, down 0.18, on turnover of 46,000 contracts on Liffe. In the cash market, the yield on benchmark 10-year gilts was 4.97%, with the yield spread between gilts and bunds widening to 105 basis points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

396,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,LEADER - The Fed edges back to normal.,"The US Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by one quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 per cent, means that it has now taken back two-thirds of last autumn's emergency 0.75 point cuts. The move was widely expected. The markets are already looking ahead to October's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, wondering if it will finish clawing back the cuts then. As the Fed statement stressed, the monetary policy stance adopted after Russia's default, is no longer ""consistent with sustained non-inflationary economic expansion"". Although there are clear risks that the economy could over-heat, consumer price inflation - at 2.1 per cent in July - is hardly threatening. More worrying has been the recent jump in the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of wages and benefits. This increased by 1.1 per cent in the three months to June, the biggest increase for eight years. However, the ECI's rise by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter was the smallest on record. The tightness of the US labour market has been a concern for policymakers for some time. Strong productivity growth at the start of the year was a comfort, but this ground to a halt in the second quarter. Again, this should not have been too much of a surprise. Part of the reason for strong productivity growth at the start of the year is that companies expected a sharp slowdown. (This, remember, was why the Fed cut rates). Thus, they held down wages. When the economy roared ahead, at a 6 per cent annualised rate in the last three months of 1998, and at 4.3 per cent at the start of the year, there was a productivity spurt. The slowdown to a more moderate pace, of 2.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the second quarter, is exactly what the Fed wanted. If the economy slows of its own accord, and due to the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, it means that the Fed will not have to raise rates as much to bring this about. But the record trade deficit, as the economy continues to suck in imports, suggest that domestic demand still needs to cool down. International forces that helped keep a lid on US inflation are wearing off. Many commodity prices are rising. The Japanese and European economies, though still fragile, are recovering. The strong dollar has had a significant disinflationary effect, but this will recede and reverse as prospects improve elsewhere - and as the US current account deficit becomes more difficult to finance. The risks of inflation, the Fed says, have been markedly diminished by the two recent rate rises. But it is likely to find it has more work to do at its October meeting.

397,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL - SA bank governor proposes inflation targeting policy.,"Tito Mboweni's appointment in July last year as South Africa's first black central bank governor took place against the backdrop of a plunging currency and massive interest rate increases as the country fell victim to emerging market upheaval. Yesterday, by contrast, Mr Mboweni's maiden policy address caused hardly a ripple in the domestic markets. Bond traders said his comments were ""pretty much as expected"", adding that they were more worried about the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day. The new governor emphasised the central bank's continuing independence and made clear that he saw inflation as his most important concern. ""In the pursuit of the primary objective of price stability it is essential, as stated in the constitution, that the Reserve Bank performs its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice,"" he said. Mr Mboweni, a former ANC politician and a development economist by training, allayed fears that he might bow to populist pressures by saying that a monetary policy that maintained financial stability would make ""the best contribution to improving economic growth, employment and living standards"". He acknowledged that the eclectic monetary approach used by his predecessor, Chris Stals, had been ""useful"" for containing inflation, but said that it had, at times, created uncertainty about the bank's intermediate objectives. Formal inflation targeting would be more transparent, he said, and ought to ""allay some of these uncertainties"". Inflation targeting would be more effective if the government's policies were properly co-ordinated. He proposed a policy target agreement to be signed by himself and Trevor Manuel, the minister of finance. A Monetary Policy Committee, similar to that of the Bank of England, is also to be established, consisting of the governor and deputy governors as voting members and senior officials as non-voting members. Given that inflation targeting was ""a complicated monetary framework requiring careful preparation"", Mr Mboweni said the functions of the central bank's economics department were being revised and reorganised and that the unit would become a research department ""concentrating on monetary issues and co-ordinating research in the Bank"". Mr Mboweni did not announce a date for implementing the policy, or the level at which the target was likely to be set. In July, consumer inflation dipped below the 5 per cent level for the first time since 1970. * Thousands of civil servants belonging to all 12 of South Africa's public sector unions took to the streets in protest yesterday after a breakdown in wage negotiations with the government. The state angered workers this month by putting into effect an average pay increase of 6.3 per cent. The unions want 7.3 per cent. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

398,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Slight rally after Fed raises rates.,"US government bond markets rallied slightly after the Federal Reserve raised two key interest rates, while maintaining a neutral bias on future interest rate policy. As expected, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee raised the key Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points from 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent. However, it also raised the less frequently used discount rate by 25 basis points and maintained its neutral policy stance, signalling it was not necessarily leaning towards raising rates again. The FOMC said its actions should ""markedly diminish"" the risk of inflation appearing in the economy. Bond markets rallied on the news, then fell back slightly in late trading, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up to 102 11/16, sending the yield down to 5.932 per cent. The 5-year note rose 13/32 to 101 9/32, to yield 5.700, while the 2-year note gained 1/8 to yield 5.584. Elsewhere, euro-zone economic data received little attention ahead of the Fed decision, with markets widely anticipating the quarter-point rise in US rates. UK gilts lacked direction amid seasonally light trading and ended very slightly lower, with the long end of the yield curve gently outperforming the short end. The September contract in the gilt future settled 0.08 lower at 110.51 while the long gilt due in June 2028 yielded 4.70 per cent, down 3 basis points. Weaker-than-expected UK trade data had little impact. Concentrating on what was happening in the US, the gilt market largely ignored figures from the Office for National Statistics that showed the UK trade deficit with the rest of the world ballooning to #2.5bn in June. Debt markets also largely ignored higher-than-expected German producer price data which showed July producer prices rising by 0.3 per cent month-on-month and falling by 1.0 per cent year-on-year. Forecasts were for a 0.2 per cent monthly rise and a fall of 1.1 per cent year-on-year. Ten-year bund futures hardly moved at all - settling at 108.80, down 0.03 on the day. There was significantly more action in Japan. An already lethargic Japanese government bond market was battered by sluggish bidding for a Y1,400bn auction of 10-year, 1.9 per cent coupon bonds. The Finance Ministry announced that the lowest price for the issue was 99.70 with a yield of 1.935 per cent, while the average price was 99.85 to yield 1.917 per cent. Trading, however, pushed the new bond briefly to 2 per cent on the secondary market - the highest level the 10-year bond yield has been since February 16, when it stood at 2.02 per cent. The auction highlighted reluctance among private investors to buy more bonds because of continuing fears that the government will flood the market with new bonds later in the year to finance a second supplementary budget. The poor results of the auction spurred hedge-selling of both cash JGBs and JGB futures, and market sentiment darkened ahead of an auction of two-year bonds planned tomorrow and six-year and 30-year bond auctions planned for next week. The price of the March futures contract for 10-year bonds lost 0.43 to 128.18, sending the yield up to 0.042 points to 2.482 per cent. Plan for Rs25bn auction depresses Indian prices Indian bond prices settled sharply lower yesterday, following an announcement from the government of a Rs25bn bond auction, writes Sathnam Sanghera. The Reserve Bank of India said it would be reissuing 10-year, 11.99 per cent bonds on Friday, August 27. Existing 11.99 per cent 2009 bonds fell to a low of Rs102.45 on the news and eventually recovered to 102.50 - much weaker than the morning's price level of Rs102.58. ""The market became more volatile after the bond auction announcement,"" said one dealer at a broking house. Bids on the 12.40 per cent 2013 bond dropped to Rs103.55/57 as sentiment darkened, compared with the central bank sale price of Rs103.62. There has been a bearish mood in the market since Monday, when the Reserve Bank said that it would pay for oil imports from its reserves. This led to fears of a rupee outflow from the system. The RBI also altered its sale list on Monday. The securities on the list included the 11.0 per cent 2002 bond, the 12.40 per cent 2013 bond and two 364-day treasury bills maturing on February 25 and March 24 in the year 2000.

399,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Dow falters after Fed rate decision.,"US shares weakened in the minutes after the Federal open market committee announced it had raised two key short-term interest rates, writes John Labate in New York. The rate rise was widely anticipated by investors in the week leading up to the meeting, as stocks continued to move higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record close on Monday, but in the minutes after the Fed announcement the blue-chip index was down 60.47 to 11,239.29, with more than 90 minutes left on the trading day. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was 1.80 lower at 1,358.42 while declining shares out-numbered advancing ones on the NYSE. Stronger internet and semiconductor shares gave a boost to the Nasdaq composite, which added 27.23 at 2,746.80. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond remained just below 6 per cent, with a 15/32 gain in price to 102 7/16. In the Dow, Procter &Gamble shares were up $1 3/8 to $99 5/8 after the consumer products producer was raised by PaineWebber to an ""attractive"" rating from ""neutral"". Aluminium producer Alcoa fell back $2 7/8 or 4 per cent to $63 3/8. Shares in workstation producer SGI tumbled 12 per cent to $10 7/8 one day after the departure of the company's chief executive. Media company Time Warner, down 7 per cent to $61 1/2, was the most actively-traded stock on the midday NYSE after Merrill Lynch cut its earnings estimate for 1999. Chip stocks were strong performers overall, sending the Philadelphia stock exchange's semiconductor index up 1.6 per cent to 524. Micron Technologies surged 6 per cent to $67 9/16. Online telephony company Net2Phone jumped more than $9 7/8 to $57 after the company announced a deal with Compaq Computer. Internet company At Home had another strong session, up more than 4 per cent to $41 5/8, one day after a 6 per cent gain. Gap fell $11/16 to $41 1/16 after Deutsche Banc Alex Brown lowered its rating on the retailer to ""market perform"" from ""buy"". Leading retailer and Dow member stock Wal-Mart was down $1/4 to $47 1/2. TORONTO swung modestly lower in early trading as investors slogged out the final few hours of uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on US interest rates. Banks, one of the more interest rate-sensitive sectors, were a firm market, but resource stocks ran into widespread selling. At the noon count, the 300 composite index was off 10.76 at 7,164.20. Royal Bank of Canada added 45 cents at C$67.25 and Canadian Imperial improved 25 cents at C$34.25, although trading volumes were said to be light. The main excitements on the upside centred on airline stocks following a move to merge Air Canada and Canadian Airlines in a C$5.7bn deal. Air Canada added 15 cents at C$8.65 and Canadian Airlines 16 cents to C$8.65. Onex Corp, the conglomerate that is a leading light behind the deal, rose 75 cents to C$27.00.

400,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Last-minute jitters ahead of US rate move.,"Stock markets moved sideways as investors awaited developments at the Federal Reserve amid expectations that only a modest rise in US interest rates would emerge, writes Vincent Boland. While there was speculation in some quarters that recent US economic data showing a continued slowdown in inflation was enough to put any rate rise on hold, the general feeling was that the Fed would act by lifting the rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The dollar held steady in early European foreign exchange trading but was hit by nerves as the FOMC meeting - a rate announcement was expected at 2.15pm Washington time - got closer. The currency slipped to an intra-day low of $1/ Y111.6 and $1.05/EUR1 in New York trading. Asian markets had set the tone overnight, posting modest falls. Tokyo stocks were hit by a bout of profit-taking in the banking sector after big recent gains. European markets remained largely flat as Wall Street opened slightly weaker and traders said there was no real trend ahead of the Fed announcement. Unlike in the US, there is little prospect of a rate rise in Europe until perhaps the second half of next year, according to the latest European market overview from the strategy team at Salomon Smith Barney. The bank says the euro zone economy is set for a benign period of accelerating growth, low inflation and shrinking fiscal deficits. The pick-up in growth - Salomon has raised its forecast for European gross domestic product growth for 2000 to 2.8 per cent - should help stabilise the euro against the dollar in the near term. Meanwhile, the expected rises in European interest rates next year and the likelihood that the US economy will be slowing by then ""probably will lift the euro close to its long-term average of $1.17/EUR1 during 2000"", the bank says. Inflation should also stay below the European Central Bank's target ceiling of 2 per cent throughout next year despite the better economic growth outlook. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

401,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Pfandbriefe issue to test market.,"The depth of the euro-denominated market is to be tested by more than EUR10bn worth of Pfandbriefe bonds coming to the market in the next few days. Rheinhyp, a German mortgage and public sector lender, joined the line of Pfandbrief issuers yesterday. It is looking to raise EUR2bn-EUR3bn in the maturity of 5-8 years. This follows the announcement by DePfa, one of the largest mortgage lenders in Germany, to raise EUR3bn-EUR5bn. Algemeine Hypothekenbank (AHB) is set to launch a EUR5bn 10-year Pfandbrief today following the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting. Borrowers, who normally would have spread their issue over a few months, are trying to cram their issues in September. This is because they fear concerns over the millennium bug may cause a liquidity crunch in the market in the last quarter of the year. Since the launch of the euro the Pfandbrief market became the largest and most liquid non-government bond market in the euro-zone. However, many observers doubt whether the market is deep enough to absorb so many issues, particularly as euro-zone governments are also continuing to borrow. Germany, for example, will today auction EUR5bn in 5-year bonds. However, a banker at Commerzbank said jumbo Pfandbriefe have the advantage over corporate issues of being more liquid - something that investors are particularly sensitive to at present. The market yesterday was calm, ahead of the FOMC meeting. SNCF, the French railway operator, added EUR250m to its 10-year bond, bringing it up to EUR1bn in total. The bond was priced to yield 36 basis points over the 10-year French OAT, 6 basis points wider than its original issue in June. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

402,2008-09-16,2008-09-17,Financial Times,Fed keeps all options open by holding rates,"News Analysis Bernanke's decision has been branded brave by some analysts and risky by others, writes Krishna Guha The Federal Reserve defied intense market pressure to cut interest rates yesterday - holding rates at 2 per cent and adopting a neutral all-options-open stance on monetary policy. Analysts said it was a brave decision by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, while some termed it risky. Many drew parallels with Treasury secretary Hank Paulson's decision not to help rescue Lehman Brothers at the weekend. The new stance keeps open the possibility of a future interest rate cut if financial chaos escalates or growth weakens dramatically, but indicates no predisposition to ease. For the first time in many months, the Federal open market committee was united. The Fed did make it clear that it was paying close attention to financial turmoil. ""Strains in financial markets have increased significantly,"" the committee said. It would monitor developments ""carefully"" and act ""as needed"" - a combination of words that suggests the Fed would not rule out an intermeeting cut in some circumstances. Yet the US central bank did not adopt an easing bias. Instead it explicitly moved to a neutral assessment of the balance of risks, stating ""the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern"". The statement makes it clear that the US central bank has decided in the first instance to battle the storm with liquidity tools. It appeared poised to follow up Sunday's dramatic easing of collateral terms for investment banks with emergency liquidity support for AIG, the troubled insurance group, and possibly an increase in swap lines with central banks in Europe as well. In the short term these moves could act as partial substitutes for a rate cut, buying the Fed time to evaluate market developments and their implications for the economy. Traders said the crisis at AIG rather than the collapse of Lehman was the primary cause of market turbulence yesterday. The concern is that because insurance companies do not theoretically have access to emergency finance from the Fed in the way a bank or now investment bank does, an unwinding process could be abrupt and disorderly, with firesales of assets. The Fed could deal with this in a targeted manner, by brokering a private sector rescue for AIG, making a direct Fed loan to AIG, or providing back-to-back loans via a bank such as JPMorgan Chase. But the moral hazard cost of providing emergency finance to an insurance company could be great. A big increase in the dollar swap lines with European central banks would also provide a targeted way to calm the extraordinary pressures in the money market, which are most intense outside the US. In addition to increased financial stress, yesterday's statement highlighted a further weakening in labour markets, a recent slowdown in US growth and a softening in consumer spending, while warning that ""some slowing in export growth"" would also weigh on growth in the coming quarters. Yet while the Fed no longer expressed concern about some measures of inflation expectations, it still said ""the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain"" - and put inflation risk on a par with growth risk, to the surprise of many analysts. This suggests the hurdle for further rate cuts remains quite high, in part due to uncertainty as to the magnitude of the effect of financial turmoil on the economy. The Fed may also feel that it has some support in the near term from the plunge in Treasury yields, which limits any rise in overall borrowing costs, and from the fall in oil. Unless the current turmoil escalates out of control it could take a significant further deterioration of the economic outlook before the Fed would consider further easing - likely in convoy with other central banks. ""The Federal Reserve took a gamble today,"" said Marc Chandler, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said ""I think it is a mistake, both in substance and in tactics."" However, Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said: ""It was the right decision."""
403,1995-08-22,1995-08-23,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - TECHNOLOGY SECTOR REBOUNDS.,"Wall Street August vacations and steady interest rates kept US shares mostly flat in thin trading, but technology stocks staged a strong rebound from Monday's drop, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Few on Wall Street expected the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to lower interest rates at yesterday's meeting, but investors were hopeful that any post-meeting release would give a general signal about the course of monetary policy. The FOMC, however, did not issue any statement at the conclusion of its meeting. After moving modestly downwards in early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average staged a late-session improvement to end a net 5.64 higher at 4,620.42. The Standard &Poor's 500 rose 1.41 to 559.52 and the American Stock Exchange composite was 0.18 firmer at 528.39. Volume on the New York SE was moderate at 290.9m shares. Other financial markets were also nearly flat yesterday. The dollar also started mostly lower but edged higher against the D-Mark and yen in late trading, changing hands for DM 1.4867 and Y 96.90 compared to DM 1.4771 and Y 96.87 late on Monday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 7/32 to 99 27/32 to yield 6.882%. A rebound in technology stocks led the Nasdaq composite, which is weighted towards that industrial area, to rise 5.59 to 1,025.29 in spite of declines in other sectors, such as biotechnology and health care, which are also concentrated in the Nasdaq. The Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was more than 1.3% higher. Microsoft recovered from the $2 5/8 it fell on Monday by jumping $4 13/16 to $99 5/16, and Dell Computer added $1 1/4 at $73 1/8, bouncing from the $4 1/4 it lost on Monday. Semiconductor makers and related companies were especially strong. Intel gained $2 at $62 1/4, partially reversing the $4 5/8 the shares lost on Monday. Applied Materials regained $5 7/8 of the $8 1/4 lost on Monday, bringing the shares to $110 7/8. On the NYSE, Texas Instruments was $2 3/4 higher at $76 1/2 and Micron Technology gained $4 3/8 at $72 3/8. Biotech leader Amgen shed $3/4 to $48 1/4 and Genzyme lost $3/4 at $62 1/2. King World Productions continued the slide begun late on Monday when Turner Broadcasting System decided to end negotiations to buy the company, which syndicates popular television programmes such as 'Oprah'. On Monday the shares fell $3 after the Turner board concluded its meeting just moments before the market closed. By yesterday's close the shares had declined a further $2 7/8, bringing the price to $38 7/8, below the level reached when reports that Turner was interested in the company surfaced in late June, but above its price in March when King World hired two investment banks to help it explore the possibility of a sale. Canada Toronto slipped modestly for the second straight day as equity markets continued their directionless trading. The TSE 300 index ended 6.62 points off at 4,601.68, while declining issues outscored rises by 424 to 330 after volume of 70.5m shares valued at C$845m. Ten of the 14 sub-indices closed lower, led by the golds group, off 0.73%, as the spot price for gold in New York fell $1.50 to $383.25 an ounce. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
404,1995-08-22,1995-08-23,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - MARKET LOOKS FOR FURTHER FALL IN GERMAN REPO RATE.,"Weaker than expected July M3 money supply data in Germany yesterday bolstered expectations of a further fall in interest rates this week. The initial focus will be on the outcome of the weekly repo auction today, but a possibility also exists that the Bundesbank council will sanction a cut in the discount rate when it meets tomorrow. There was little expectation of any change in US interest rates ahead of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. The expectation of lower German rates gave the dollar rally renewed enthusiasm. It rose to an intraday high of DM 1.49 before slipping back to finish in London at DM 1.4852, from DM 1.4723. Against the yen it ended at Y 96.6, from Y 96.715. It closed in New York at DM 1.4863 and Y 96.855. The same set of factors saw European currencies such as the lira, peseta and Swedish krona power ahead against the D-Mark. The peseta broke through the Pta85 level to end at Pta84.98 and the krona finished at SKr4.947 from SKr4.998. The pound also firmed against the weaker D-Mark, but lost ground against the dollar. It finished at DM 2.2838, from DM 2.2693, and at $1.5377, from $1.5413. Market opinion polls suggest that a cut in official German rates this week is unlikely. A Reuters poll of 20 economists across Europe found that 85% of them thought there would be no cut now, although the bulk of these expect a cut in the fourth quarter. Curiously, a survey of German money market dealers conducted by MMS, the financial advisory group, reached different conclusions. It found that almost half of those surveyed expected a 50 basis-point reduction in the discount and Lombard rates this week. The repo rate is expected to fall to 4.40% today. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN Amro in London, said he was sceptical of a cut this week on the grounds that the key financial data were substantially unchanged from the end of March, when the Bundesbank last lowered rates. The D-Mark has also lost 8% against the dollar since then. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at PaineWebber in London, said the M3 figures provided a suitable hook for a change in policy, but predicted that the Bundesbank would probably hold off for a while yet. 'When your crosses are doing well, you might as well save the discount rate until other people need it,' she said. With the Bundesbank assumed to tolerate a 25 basis-point gap between the repo rate and the discount rate, the repo still has some way to fall before it threatens this limit. The repo rate is currently at 4.45%, compared to the 4% discount rate. Ms Cottrell said that on this basis there was still room for 'fairly hefty' falls in the repo rate before the discount rate had to be cut. She said she believed another 50 basis-point cut was on the cards, predicting that the Bundesbank was likely to act before the repo moved towards the 4.25% threshold. For those concerned about the likely duration of the dollar's rally, and the relationship of the yen and D-Mark legs of such an upturn, some advice came from Mr Brian Marber, an independent technical analyst in London. He said his studies of the only four Dollars /D-Mark rallies since the end of the 1970s showed they had all been accompanied by yen rallies. He concluded: 'I am not expecting DM/Dollars to peak for another 14 to 19 days, therefore yen/Dollars can be expected to rally for approximately the same period.' Over this period, he sees the dollar rising to a range of around DM 1.50-60, with a further advance to around DM 1.75 by October 1996 likely. Signs of a slowdown in the UK economy have been well received in the short sterling market. The March and June 1996 contracts both reached record highs, respectively 93.07 and 92.90. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London, pointed out that the longer dated contracts in 1996 and 1997 had, by comparison, underperformed and were ripe for a catch-up. After forecasting an #815m money market shortage, the Bank of England provided #316m assistance at established rates and #420m late support. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
405,1995-08-22,1995-08-23,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - FOCUS TURNS TO GERMAN REPO RATE.,"Signs of a slowdown in German money supply growth, which appeared to strengthen the case for a cut in German interest rates, failed to lift European government bonds yesterday. Benchmark 10-year bonds across most markets showed little reaction to the data, which pointed to a 0.4% fall in M3 money supply last month. The German bund futures contract on Liffe traded in a narrow range - between 95.04 and 95.23 - and other European markets followed suit. But the reaction to the data at the short-end of the German yield curve was more marked. Two-year bond yields fell to 4.89% compared with 4.95 at the open, suggesting that markets are anticipating a cut in interest rates soon. The data, which follow evidence earlier in the week of weak real economic activity, now turn the spotlight on today's repo market operations. A number of analysts expect a cut in the repo rate of about 5 basis points from 4.45% currently. Attention will also be on tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting for a possible cut in the discount rate. Ms Ros Lifton, an economist at Daiwa in London, suggested that worries about the inflationary effects of a possible cut in interest rates combined with a weak D-Mark may be a reason for the muted reaction among longer-dated bonds. She added that the weak follow-through in the 10-year area may be due to the lack of demand among domestic German investors for 10-year bonds, because of concerns over European monetary union. 'Institutions have been advising domestic investors to avoid anything with a maturity beyond 1999 since they are worried they may not get their money back in D-Marks,' she said. Trading conditions were thin with dealers waiting for the outcome of the US FOMC meeting, although few expected a change in US interest rates. Disappointment over a higher-than-expected inflation figure depressed Italian government bonds. In the UK, the long gilt future on Liffe settled at 106 11/32, down 1/32 point. US Treasury prices slipped modestly after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest unchanged, even though that is what most on Wall Street expected. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 7/32 lower at 99 27/32 to yield 6.882%. At the short end, the two-year note was 1/32 lower at 99 5/8 to yield 6.063%. Few analysts believed that the Fed would alter interest rate policy at the close of yesterday's FOMC meeting, but many were hoping the policy-making group would issue a statement that might provide some guidance about the course of monetary policy through to the end of the year. However, the FOMC did not issue any statement at the close of the meeting. Also weighing on the market was new supply from the afternoon auction of $17.75bn in two-year notes. Demand was stronger than average, with the ratio of bids offered to bids accepted at 2.74-to-1. Today the Treasury was to auction $11.5bn in five-year notes. The market has fallen in past weeks under the weight of a large amount of new supply, sparking concerns that demand might be off at the auction. The dollar offered some support to bonds late in the session as it edged higher against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen in light trading. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
406,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Fed's error highlights policy role of inflation.,"Few 150-word statements are read as widely and as closely as the one accompanying the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. The fact that the Fed yesterday chose to own up to an error - and face criticism from traders - demonstrated the importance of making a judgment on inflation expectations in setting monetary policy. The seven words the Fed omitted just after 2.15pm, and reinserted just before 4pm, amounted to the same judgment given in each of its previous four meetings: ""Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" Well behaved inflation expectations, together with still robust productivity growth, have allowed the central bank to proceed in ""measured"" quarter point increments as it has raised its target federal funds rate from 1 per cent last June to 3 per cent yesterday. ""If inflation expectations rise, then that's how you get inflation embedded in wage demands and the pricing system,"" said Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. ""This is the kind of pernicious inflation they want to avoid."" Having to resort to more aggressive rate increases would have disturbed financial markets considerably more than yesterday's error. The Fed looks at various measures of inflation expectations, including the spread between the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, favours a measure based on disaggregating long-term interest rates, using information from futures markets, to see what inflation expectations look like in each of the next 10 years. Such measures remained reassuring, economists said yesterday. However, the Fed also pays close attention to surveys of consumer expectations. The Michigan survey, released last week, indicated just the kind of increase in long-term expectations that the Fed does not want to see. Yesterday's mistake was embarrassing for a central bank that has placed such emphasis on its communication with markets as a means of driving policy. The Fed said human error was to blame. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the confusion followed a discussion among members of the Federal Open Market Committee as to whether the assurance was still warranted. But the other change on the inflation language did - purposefully - indicate increased concern about inflation pressure. The FOMC dropped its judgment that higher headline inflation was not feeding into higher core inflation. Fed policymakers have been relatively relaxed about the high headline inflation rate, driven by the oil price. But there is growing concern over possible effects on business pricing decisions as well as consumer expectations. Ian Shepherdson, at High Frequency Economics, said the net effect of the corrected statement was to make the Fed's message a bit less stark. But, he added in a note to clients, the clear signal remained that: rates were still too low; inflation pressures were building; and the slowdown was nothing like severe enough to induce a pause in the rate increases. The solid pace of spending growth might have slowed a bit, the statement said, but this was in large part the result of high energy prices. At most this suggested the Fed sees the recent lull as another soft-patch, similar to the short-lived slowdown last summer. Hardening the language on inflation offset the Fed's acknowledgement of recent weaker economic data. Since the FOMC does not meet again until the end of June, it has plenty of time to watch the data. Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said in prescient fashion after the first version of yesterday's statement was issued: ""I would not emphasise the tweaking of the language as much as the fact that, after eight rate increases, the Fed acknowledged that policy remains accommodative and said it will continue to raise rates at a measured pace.""

407,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Fed correction adds to volatility GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"The Federal Open Market Committee raised short-term interest rates yesterday for the eighth successive time, by 0.25 per cent to 3 per cent. But the Fed put markets on a roller-coaster ride as it corrected the wording of its statement at about 4pm in New York. Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds fell initially, but then rose after the FOMC added words that suggested a benign view on longer-term inflation to its statement. The 10-year Treasuries were yielding 4.16 per cent in late afternoon trading, down from 4.19 per cent. The text of the FOMC's statement once again suggested interest rate hikes might continue at a ""measured"" pace. Overall, the wording leaves the Fed with flexibility to act ""the way they see fit"" in the light of future economic signals, said John Roberts, managing director at Barclays Capital. Stronger-than-expected data on factory orders prompted selling of bonds before the FOMC announcement but did little to clarify conflicting signals about the economic outlook emerging from the world's largest economy in recent weeks. Activity was muted in the eurozone and UK government bond markets ahead of the Fed decision. But yields on eurozone government bonds hit new historic lows as market expectations for a rate hike this year dimmed. The yield on the 10-year Bund reached 3.373 per cent before rising to 3.376 per cent, down 2.2bp on the day. The two-year Schatz was 2.2bp lower at 2.213 per cent. Though the European Central Bank was widely expected to keep rates steady at 2 per cent when it makes its announcement today, the steady stream of gloomy economic news has stirred murmurings in the market of a possible cut in interest rates later this year. ""The absence of a turnround in the labour market in Germany, and in the eurozone more generally, will therefore be an added reason for the ECB to keep rates on hold this year,"" said Julien Seetharamdoo, economist at Capital Economics. Concerns on growth also came to the fore in the UK, where retailers reported the worst sales volume for over 10 years in April, while data showed that the manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time in almost two years. As a result, prices of gilts rose and yields on the 10-year bond fell 2.9bp to 4.508 per cent, while the two-year gilt yield also lost 2.9bp to 4.483 per cent. Markets in Japan were closed for public holidays. "
408,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Factory orders data spur selling GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"Trading in the US Treasury market was light and prices stayed within a narrow range yesterday as traders awaited the interest rate decision from the US Federal Open Market Committee. Stronger-than-expected data on factory orders prompted some selling of bonds but did little to clarify conflicting signals about the economic outlook emerging from the world's largest economy in recent weeks. So while it was widely expected that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 3 per cent - to make it the eighth successive increase - investors were poised to react to any change in the outlook on inflation and economic growth, or in the Fed's ""measured"" approach to interest rate rises in the accompanying statement. Ahead of the Fed announcement, yields on 10-year Treasuries were unchanged at 4.198 per cent during New York's mid-afternoon trading. The yield on the two-year note was yielding 3.637 per cent. Activity was also muted in the eurozone and UK government bond markets ahead of the Fed decision. But yields on eurozone government bonds hit new historic lows as market expectations for a rate hike this year dimmed. The yield on the 10-year Bund reached 3.373 per cent before rising slightly to 3.376 per cent, down 2.2bp on the day. The two-year Schatz was also 2.2bp lower at 2.213 per cent. Though the European Central Bank was widely expected to keep rates steady at 2 per cent when it makes its announcement today, the steady stream of gloomy economic news has stirred murmurings in the market of a possible cut in interest rates later this year.

409,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Fed raises rates another quarter point FOMC MEETING.,"The US Federal Reserve signalled no change in its strategy yesterday, as it raised its target federal funds rate another quarter point to 3 per cent and said it would continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. The Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged recent weaker economic data, in its accompanying statement, but also hardened its language on inflation pressures. Fed policymakers had indicated in the run-up to the meeting that inflation remained the committee's primary concern. The Fed repeated in the statement that monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue removing this accommodation ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Rather than attempting to influence market expectations, the committee can be seen as leaving itself with flexibility to respond to the incoming data, while signalling that it will press ahead with rate increases. The federal funds rate, at 3 per cent, is still seen as too low to be consistent with price stability over time. The FOMC does not meet again until the end of June, a two-day meeting at which members will update their individual economic forecasts ahead of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's twice-yearly testimony before Congress. Financial markets were little changed following yesterday's announcement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has declined significantly since March, and stock markets have been weak as investors have reacted to the recent weaker signs on consumer and business spending. The Fed said ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices"". It added that the labour market continued to improve gradually. But it signalled its concern about inflation, repeating that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months"". The Fed also removed its judgment, given at its March meeting, that the rise in energy prices ""has not notably fed through to core consumer prices"". It also deleted from its statement the judgment that it saw inflation expectations as remaining ""well-contained"", an assurance it has given at its last four meetings. Fed policymakers have been relatively relaxed about the high headline inflation rate, driven by the oil price, but the concern is that there will start to be second-round effects on business pricing decisions and consumer inflation expectations. Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said: ""I would not emphasise the tweaking of the language as much as the fact that, after eight rate increases the Fed acknowledged that policy remains accommodative and said it will continue to raise rates at a measured pace."" The minutes of past meetings suggest that though some policymakers are not comfortable with maintaining the forward-looking guidance, the bulk of committee members do not think it reduces their flexibility to raise rates more aggressively than quarter-point increases, or pause the tightening campaign. "
410,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed policy watchers find language less helpful.,"Since the Federal Reserve started to provide explicit forward-looking guidance in late 2003 it has repeatedly increased its flexibility to respond to events. Some economists think maximum flexibility has been achieved and the forward-looking language is no longer providing much guidance. Paul McCulley, Fed-watcher at Pimco, the giant bond fund, said: ""The statement has been tortured to the point where it is not particularly illuminating now."" When it raised rates to 3 per cent this week, the Federal Open Market Committee maintained that monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" or too low to be consistent with price stability over time. It also said that it expected to continue with a ""measured"" pace of tightening, generally seen as indicating quarter-point increases, but which most Fed policymakers see as consistent with more aggressive rate increases or with no change at the next meeting. It acknowledged the recent slower economic data, while linking this to earlier increases in energy prices, and also increased inflation risks, acknowledging implicitly that energy prices were now feeding into increased core inflationary pressures. Balanced growth and inflation risks are predicated on its assumption of appropriate monetary action. ""Their statement is loaded with contingencies now. The market is getting much more uncertain about where the Fed is going in the next few months,"" said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers. Before the recent spate of weaker economic data, futures markets were pricing in a 4 per cent federal funds rate at the end of the year, implying continuing quarter-point increases and just one pause, probably in thin trading before Christmas. The market is now pricing in close to 3.75 per cent at year end and hardly higher during 2006. However, Lehman's ""Fediscope"" model which provides the probability of different outcomes based on futures market pricing and risk spreads points to a 40 per cent chance of a 3.5 per cent federal funds rate after the September meeting, a 26 per cent chance of 3.75 per cent and a 22 per cent chance of 3.25 per cent. That is probably just how the Fed wants it, given the uncertainty in the economic outlook. If over the two months before its next meeting the data show that the slowdown in growth is more than a soft patch, or that inflation risks demand decisive action, the Fed can act accordingly. For now, the market is playing a useful stabilising role. ""Given the recent softness in the data, committee members are probably thankful that the market is not pricing in too much tightening and that broad financial conditions are accommodative. Six weeks ago they were more concerned that their interest rate increases were getting more traction,"" said Brian Sack, at Macroeconomic Advisers, the consultancy. Macroeconomic Advisers, along with many professional forecasters, expects a more aggressive Fed, with stronger growth later in the year leading to a federal funds rate climbing to 4.5 per cent next year. A number of Fed-watchers suggest that the June meeting, before chairman Alan Greenspan's twice-yearly testimony before Congress, will be when the committee chooses to make significant changes to its statement. Mr McCulley, who thinks the Fed has almost finished raising rates, said he expected the Fed to take the same approach as in May 1994, when the statement declared it had ""substantially removed"" its policy accommodation. ""What I think we are coming up to, most likely at the end of June, is that they declare that they have substantially removed accommodation,"" he said, at the same time as they dropped the measured pace language. ""Then Mr Greenspan can take a bow at his final Humphrey Hawkins testimony in July."" "
411,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Stocks buoyed by GM and Fed.,"World stock markets moved higher on Wednesday in the wake of a widely-expected rise in US interest rates, with Wall Street further boosted by some positive news on General Motors. But the dollar weakened across the board as the Federal Reserve's accompanying statement prompted speculation that it could take an earlier than expected pause in tightening policy. The US central bank lifted its main lending rate by 25 basis points to 3 per cent - the eighth quarter point rise since last June. It said that long-term inflation remained contained but acknowledged that spending had slowed in the face of high energy prices. That left economists debating how much further rates would rise. ""Despite both recent inflation and activity data giving the Fed a nasty surprise, the FOMC statement showed little change,"" said Tim Drayson at ABN Amro. ""The Fed believes growth will remain robust. We think the growth and inflation trade-off is deteriorating. Either way, the Fed must continue tightening."" But Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, argued that rates might be at their peak. ""If the US economy were truly healthy, the Fed should target the federal funds rate in the 5 to 5.5 per cent zone,"" he said. ""However, with America's cyclical impetus now fading, post-bubble fault lines could deepen - making it all but impossible for the Fed to normalize real interest rates. This week could mark the Fed's last rate hike of this cycle."" By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index were both up 0.7 per cent. Dow component General Motors raced ahead after billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian said he would buy a significant stake in the ailing company. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.6 per cent to 1,075.03. The European Central Bank's decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 2 per cent came as no surprise to investors. Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, ruled out any cut in rates in spite of flagging economic growth in the eurozone, helping to push European government bond yields off historic lows. Tokyo remained shut for the Golden Week holiday, although Hong Kong climbed to an eight-week high as local banks left their prime rates unchanged despite the Fed's move. The dollar fell to a six-week low against the yen as the Fed's statement disappointed those who had expected more hawkish comments and the Japanese currency continued to find support from speculation about a possible revaluation of the Chinese renminbi. The US currency also eased back from Tuesday's two-week high against the euro, although it trimmed its decline following some shock news from the bond market. The US Treasury said it was considering bringing back the 30-year note, three-and-a-half years since ceasing issuance, sending long-dated bonds tumbling. The prospect of new supply sent the yield on 30-year paper soaring, while 10-year yields also climbed. Oil prices initially moved lower after weekly data showed that US crude inventories had reached their highest levels for nearly six years. But by midday, Nymex WTI for June delivery had recovered and was hovering around the key $50 a barrel level. Gold moved higher as the dollar weakened but proved unable to break out of its recent ranges. "
412,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar slides on dovish Fed statement.,"The US dollar fell to a six-week low against the yen on Wednesday amid softening expectations for further US rate hikes and hardening expectations of an imminent Chinese revaluation. The Federal Open Market Committee surprised no one by sanctioning its eighth straight rate rise, taking the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent, on Tuesday. And the dollar initially rose as the FOMC omitted the line that ""longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained"" that had appeared in previous statements. However the Fed later rushed out a correction which included the above statement. This led most analysts to view the statement as broadly dovish, weakening the dollar. ""After the initial, almost complete statement, the dollar looked fairly buoyant as the text seemed to support the widespread outlook for regular rate increases. However, the addition of the final piece of text put the whole thing into a different light,"" said Chris Gothard, currencies strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. The FOMC's view that ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" gave a dovish tinge to the overall statement. ""The Fed's recognition of the negative impact on demand from spiralling energy costs arguably implies genuine doubts as to the plausibility of bestowing further financial pain upon private sector America,"" concluded Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York. With the futures market now pricing in just three more rate rises by the year-end, Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief forex strategist at UBS, warned: ""We believe the structurally challenged US currency needs continually improving interest rate support to maintain stability."" The dollar fell to Y104.21 against the yen, 0.8 per cent weaker than before the statement, before recoveirng a little to Y104.68. The dollar also lost 0.6 per cent at $1.2938 against the euro, 0.5 per cent at $1.8999 against sterling and 0.3 per cent to C$1.2502 against the Canadian dollar. The yen drew support from the continuing speculation of a revaluation by China, a move seen as heralding a period of broad Asian currency strength. This speculation also allowed the South Korean won to firm 0.7 per cent to Won995 against the dollar and the Taiwan dollar to gain 0.9 per cent to T$31.00, a six-week high. A surge in the Malaysian stock exchange was attributed to foreign investors increasing their exposure in the belief that the ringgit's peg of 3.8 to the dollar could be eased. However, with the yen having already rallied from Y108.80 against the dollar in the past four weeks, Chris Towner, consultant at risk manager HIFX, argued it could be a case of ""buy the rumour, sell the fact"". The yen may already have staged its Chinese revaluation rally, and could weaken when Beijing finally moves. The euro was unaffected by the claim from Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, that a rate cut was ""not an option"". Mr Trichet was speaking after the ECB held rates at 2 per cent for the 23rd straight month. However high-yielding currencies, the beneficiaries of dollar-funded carry trades, drew succour from the easing rate hike expectations from the US. The South African rand rose 1.4 per cent to R5.9853 to the dollar, with the Brazilian real 0.5 per cent stronger at a fresh 35-month high of R$2.4758. Eastern European currencies were supported by signs that France may be swinging back to supporting the proposed EU constitution, reducing the risk of their entry into the euro being delayed. The Polish zloty firmed 0.9 per cent to 4.196 zlotys to the euro and the Slovak koruna gained 1.1 per cent to SK38.855. "
413,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Bunds fall after ECB says rates are 'appropriate'.,"Eurozone government bond prices fell and yields climbed as the possibility of a rate cut by the European Central Bank was all but ruled out on Wednesday. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, told reporters at a news conference that interest rates were at exceptionally low levels but that they were appropriate and a rate cut was still not an option. The news conference followed the expected announcement earlier in the day that the ECB will keep rates steady at 2 per cent. They have been at 2 per cent since June, 2003. Amid growing gloom about economic growth in the region and expectations of a rate hike in the near future growing ever dimmer, some had priced in the small possibility of a rate cut later this year or next year. The European debt market has rallied over the past week, with yields reaching new historic lows. Mr Trichet said: ""Regarding the current situation and the short-term outlook for economic activity, recent data and survey indicators are, on balance, on the downside. At the same time, when looking beyond the short term, conditions remain in place for stronger real GDP growth."" The yield on the 10-year benchmark Bund was 2.3 basis points higher at 3.397 per cent, but not far from the new lows of 3.362 per cent, hit earlier in the day. The two-year Schatz was yielding 2.250 per cent, up 1.4bp, but it earlier touched 2.195 per cent, its lowest level in over a year. By contrast to the eurozone, the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday raised its main rate by 0.25 per cent, as expected, to 3 percent and signaled more measured increases. But the Fed gave markets a roller-coaster ride as it corrected the wording of its statement after the original announcement. Prices of government bonds fell initially, but then rose after the FOMC added a benign view on longer-term inflation to its statement. In the UK, gilts traded within a narrow range as investors took profits on recent strong gains. But losses were limited with the strong performance of debt in the eurozone helping to prop up prices. The yield on the 10-year gilt was up 1.6bp at 4.523 per cent and the yield on the two-year gilt was up 0.1bp at 4.499 per cent. Financial markets in Tokyo were closed for Japan's Golden Week public holidays. "

""The delayed release of a phrase saying inflation is 'well contained' rather altered the effect of the statement accompanying last night's widely expected quarter point increase to 3 per cent in the Fed funds rate. The dollar has been under pressure all night as a result."" The broader statement was also perceived as broadly dovish, particularly the claim that ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" although labour market conditions ""apparently continue to improve gradually"". Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York, concluded that: ""The fact is that the Fed's recognition of the negative impact on demand from spiralling energy costs arguably implies genuine doubts as to the plausibility of bestowing further financial pain upon private sector America."" With this mood prevalent, the dollar fell to $1.2942 against the dollar, 0.8c worse than before the statement, Y0.5 to Y104.56 against the yen, 1.2c to $1.9007 against sterling and 0.6c to C$1.2485 against the Canadian dollar. Elsewhere trading was range-bound. The euro held at Y135.33 against the yen with the eurozone services purchasing managers' index beating consensus expectations of 52.6, despite slipping to 52.8 in April from 53 in March. The Australian dollar firmed to $0.7768 against its US namesake as the Reserve Bank held rates unchanged as expected. "

416,1995-03-28,1995-03-29,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DATA HIT TREASURIES.,"Relatively weak demand at an afternoon note auction, a weaker dollar, and data showing consumer confidence increasing rather than waning conspired to send Treasury prices sharply lower yesterday. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 7/8 at 102 3/4 to yield 7.389%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was 3/16 lower at 100 9/32, yielding 6.695%. At mid-morning, the market took a strong downward turn after figures released by the Conference Board showed consumers to be much more confident than most economists had expected. The board's general confidence index for March rose to 101 from an upwardly revised figure of 99.4 for February. Economists had forecast a decline to 97%. Bond prices slid even further in the afternoon after poor demand was shown at an afternoon auction of $17.25bn in two-year notes. The ratio of offers tendered to accepted bids came in at 2.45 to one, compared with the much stronger ratio of 2.91 to one in January's auction. In recent days, traders had expressed concern that the market's bullish turn and the drop in yields that accompanied it would decrease demand for new government securities. The Treasury is also to sell $11bn in five-year notes today. There was almost no market reaction to the announcement that the Federal Reserve had adjourned its Open Market Committee meeting without issuing any comment or taking any action as a broad consensus of Wall Street economists had held that the central bank would not alter monetary policy. Government Bonds The weaker dollar also contributed to the falling bond market. By late afternoon, the US currency slipped against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen to DM 1.3871 and Y 88.89, against DM 1.4063 and Y 89.45 late Monday. UK government bonds continued their recent trend of range-trading yesterday, as the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US weighed down any progress at the short end of the yield curve and today's gilt auction weighed on the long end. Analysts expect the auction to generate reasonable demand, particularly from domestic investors. The auction will be of #2bn of 8% gilts due 2015. A paper from UBS has pointed out that some investors avoided buying the first tranche in the hope that it would cheapen relative to the curve. These investors will be encouraged to buy today's issue because its weighting in the FT index of gilts with a maturity of more than 15 years will increase as the issue size increases from #2bn to #4bn. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe was around 103 1/8, down 1/8, with resistance seen around 103 1/2. The UK 10-year yield spread over Germany was around 151 basis points in late trading, up from 147 points the day before. German government bonds shifted up slightly yesterday, with little economic news to drive any movement and investors staying firmly on the sidelines until after the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow. Most analysts expect no reduction in short-term interest rates. The June bund future on Liffe was around 92.04, up 0.01 on the day. Traders say there is a key support level at 91.98, and a strong resistance at 92.25. These two levels are likely to set the range of trading until after Thursday. Italian government bonds ended the day lower, affected by profit-taking from Monday's rise and lack of news on pension reforms. The June BTP future on Liffe was around 93.90 in late trading, down 0.32. The yield spread over bunds was around 623 basis points in late trading, little changed from the 622 points of the day before. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
417,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Prospect of more rate rises hits stocks WALL STREET.,"US stocks fell yesterday after investors interpreted comments that accompanied a widely expected quarter-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve to mean that the US central bank was not done with its cycle of monetary tightening. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 per cent and signalled in its accompanying statement that further interest rate rises might be implemented to keep inflation at bay. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent at 10,864.86 while the S&P 500 traded 0.4 per cent lower at 1,280.08. The Nasdaq Composite managed to recover most of its earlier losses however and ended the session one point lower at 2,305.82. Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said the statement was more vague than he expected. ""I find it disheartening that they would let economic data dictate what they would do with their (rate) policy,"" he said. ""You want the Fed to be proactive not reactive. By the time they get the data, it's already in the rear view mirror."" Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries over decelerating earnings growth after Altria and Goodyear Tire &Rubber delivered mixed results. Goodyear was the session's worst perfomer, plunging more than 16 per cent to Dollars 15.64 after it delivered weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth-quarter. The results prompted analysts at Deutsche Bank to cut their rating on the stock from ""hold"" to ""sell"", citing among other things, concerns over the persistence of high raw material costs. The news also prompted a run on fellow tyremaker Cooper Tire &Rubber, down 8 per cent at Dollars 14.99 Cigarette maker Altria and drugmaker Wyeth added to investors' disappointment. Altria, owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, fell 2.1 cent to Dollars 72.34 after its fourth-quarter earnings came in below analyst estimates. Although Wyeth swung into a fourth-quarter profit, the figure came in a little below market forecasts, causing its shares to fall 1.5 per cent to Dollars 46.25. On the upside, ailing drugmaker Merck said cost-cutting and strong demand for its asthma and cholesterol medicines helped push its fourth-quarter profit slightly higher to beat Wall Street forecasts. Its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to Dollars 34.50. Fellow drugmaker Sepracor surged 17.6 per centto Dollars 56.91 after it topped market expectations with its results. Elsewhere, Napster, the digital music company, shot up 25.3 per cent to Dollars 3.91following reports that Google might be looking to buy it in an attempt to develop its own online music service. Google, which reported its quarterly results after the close, rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 432.66 "
418,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Greenspan ends Fed era with final rise in rates.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates another quarter point, a decision that brought to a close Alan Greenspan's long chairmanship of the central bank but not necessarily the campaign of rate increases. In its accompanying statement, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep the outlook for sustainable growth and price stability in balance, dropping the reference to ""measured"" policy firming that was included in December. By changing the language in its statement, Fed policymakers were attempting to avoid the impression of committing Ben Bernanke, the new Fed chairman, to further increases, while signalling that further rate increases remained likely, depending on the economic data. The committee appeared to dismiss concerns about weak growth in the fourth quarter, saying: ""Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid."" Maintaining its focus on inflation risks, it repeated the language from its December statement that while whole core inflation had stayed relatively low and inflation expectations were contained, ""possible increases in resource utilisation as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures"". ""Decisions now will be pretty much data driven, but the way they see the data at the moment suggests there will be more,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. Mr Bernanke will take over as Fed chairman today. Yesterday's was the 14th consecutive increase since June 2004 and brought the federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent. Market reaction was muted, as the change to the policy outlook was much as expected. In December, the Fed had altered its policy outlook for the first time during the tightening cycle, dropping the judgment that monetary policy remained accommodative and toning down the signal that further rate increases were pre-programmed. Futures markets suggest a high probability of another rate increase at the first meeting Mr Bernanke will chair, at the end of March. The federal funds rate is now virtually the same as the yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury notes. As well as reflecting expectations that inflation will remain under control, the flat yield curve suggests investors expect the Fed will have to cut the federal funds rate from its peak level by the end of this year. In his 18 1/2 years at the Fed, Mr Greenspan has chaired 155 FOMC meetings, including a small number of emergency meetings, and more than 1,000 meetings of the Federal Reserve board. "
419,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Greenspan era ends in subdued fashion GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"The end of the Greenspan era at the US Federal Reserve was marked yesterday by a subdued reaction to the tone of the central bank's latest statement on interest rate policy. There were no big surprises for investors to emerge from the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to be overseen by chairman Alan Greenspan after 18 years at the helm of the bank. As Ben Bernanke prepared to take over as Fed chairman today, the central bank raised its benchmark Fed funds interest rate by25 basis points to 4.5 per cent. In the announcement of the rate rise, the Fed also dropped its long-standing reference to the likelihood of further ""measured"" rate increases. But shares on Wall Street eased a little after the announcement on the Fed's statement that ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance"". ""Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."" Some share investors appeared to have hoped for a more dovish statement with a clearer signal that rate rises were coming to an end. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was0.15 per cent lower, the S&P 500 was 0.43 per cent weaker and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.31 per cent down. US treasuries were largely unchanged while the dollar pared early losses. Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said Mr Greenspan ""did not leave behind an entirely blank canvas for Mr Bernanke"". ""The Fed's bias remains on the upside, given 'solid' but 'uneven' data. This is realistic; we think strong data will leave Mr Bernanke with no choice on March 28 (to raise rates at the FOMC's next meeting),"" he said. Mr Shepherdson said the ""best bet"" was still that the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis points at the March meeting and there was a ""real risk of more"". The transition overshadowed news of a rise in US consumer confidence to the highest levels in three years in January and weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity around Chicago. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose just 0.05 per cent to 1,319.57 in cautious trade. Credit Suisse warned yesterday that financial markets might be too complacent with its measures of risk appetite hitting a 20-year high last Friday. "
420,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Treasuries receive fillip off Fed GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasury prices dipped and yields rose yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates and left the door open for at least one more increase. Economists had unanimously predicted the quarter-point rate rise to 4.5 per cent at Alan Greenspan's last meeting as Fed chairman. Instead, their focus was on the wording of the FOMC's statement. The committee removed any reference to the need for further ""measured"" tightening, saying only that additional rate increases ""may be needed"". Analysts said the changes were consistent with giving Ben Bernanke, Mr Greenspan's successor, a free hand. ""The Fed has effectively left the March policy direction to be decided with the inclusion of Bernanke, while suggesting the potential for further rate hike(s),"" said analysts at Briefing.com. Data earlier in the day showed employment costs rising in line with expectations and strong consumer confidence. Shortly after the FOMC statement was released, two-year yields were up 2.1 basis points at 4.532 per cent and 10-year yields were 1.8bp higher at 4.549 per cent. Gilt prices pushed higher and yields lower amid mixed consumer data. UK house prices rose more than expected in January and mortgage approvals in December rose. Confederation of British Industry data suggested retail sales in January were unexpectedly weak. ""The mixed news indicates little chance of an imminent rate change,"" said James Knightley, analyst at ING Financial Markets. David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said: ""The message from the weaker than expected CBI retail sales survey for January is lower interest rates in the near future."" In late trading, the yield on two-year gilts was down 0.4bp to 4.308 per cent and yields on the 10-year gilt fell 2.4bp to 4.148 per cent. Short-dated eurozone government bonds were lower as investors awaited the European Central Bank's interest rate decision on Thursday. Interest rates are widely expected to stay at 2.25 per cent. The yield on the two-year Schatz was down 1.1bp to 2.949 per cent but the 10-year Bund yield added 1.2bp to 3.468 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose 0.5bp to 1.560 per cent, responding cautiously to patchy rises in Japanese stocks. "
421,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Worries over rate rises hit stocks WALL STREET.,"US stocks fell yesterday after investors interpreted comments that accompanied a widely expected quarter-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve to mean that the US central bank was not yet done with its cycle of monetary tightening. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 per cent and signalled in its accompanying statement that further interest rate hikes might be implemented to keep inflation at bay. By mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent at 10,879.67 while the S&P 500 traded 0.5 per cent lower at 1,278.82. The Nasdaq Composite, already hurt by profit-taking in technology stocks, was off 0.3 per cent at 2,299.03. Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's investment research, said the statement was largely expected. ""The Fed statement basically said that we are close to neutral at the moment and that economic data will dictate what they will do with their policy,"" he said. Meanwhile in the wider market, the earnings season continued with mixed results from Dow components Altria and Merck. Altria, owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, fell 1.6 cent to Dollars 72.73 after its fourth-quarter earnings came in below analyst estimates. Drugmaker Wyeth and tyremaker Goodyear Tire &Rubber also disappointed investors. Although Wyeth swung into a fourth-quarter profit, the figure came in a little below market forecasts. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 45.56. Goodyear plunged more than 16 per cent to Dollars 15.69 after it delivered weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth-quarter. The results promptedanalysts at Deutsche Bank to cut their rating on the stock from ""hold"" to ""sell"", citing concerns over thepersistence of high raw material costs. On the upside, ailing drugmaker Merck said cost-cutting and strong demand for its asthma and cholesterol medicines helped push its fourth-quarter profit slightly higher to beat Wall Street forecasts. Its shares edged up 0.3 per cent to Dollars 34.56. Fellow drugmaker, Sepracor, surged 15.6 per centto Dollars 55.94 after it topped market expectations with its results. Elsewhere, Napster, the digital music company, shot up 21.5 per cent to Dollars 3.79following reports that Google might be looking to buy it in an attempt to develop its own online music service. Google, which is also due to report its quarterly results after the close, jumped 1.8 per cent to Dollars 434.42. Aluminium maker Alcoa tacked on 4 per cent to Dollars 31.75 following an upgrade to ""buy"" by UBS. "
422,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Greenspan ends Fed era with another rate rise.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates another quarter point, a decision that brought to a close Alan Greenspan's long chairmanship of the central bank but not an end to its campaign of rate increases. In its accompanying statement, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep the outlook for sustainable growth and price stability in balance. The committee appeared to dismiss fears about weak growth, saying: ""Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.""

Ben Bernanke, Mr Greenspan's successor, will take over as Fed chairman today. By changing the language in its statement, Fed policymakers were attempting to avoid the impression of committing Mr Bernanke to further increases, while signalling that more rate increases remained likely. Yesterday's was the 14th consecutive increase since June 2004 and brought the federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent. Futures markets suggest a high probability of another rise at the first meeting Mr Bernanke will chair in March. During Mr Greenspan's 18 1/2 years at the Fed, he has chaired 155 FOMC meetings. Over the period, growth and inflation have averaged 3.1 per cent. "
423,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Overview: Wall Street mulls over interest rate rises.,"Wall Street stocks gained on Wednesday in spite of the prospect of further rises in US interest rates as investors put disappointing earnings from search engine Google into context. As Ben Bernanke was sworn in as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, there was speculation that the central bank would tighten monetary policy further than many investors had expected. This lifted the dollar against the euro and yen and weakened treasuries. However, a strong performance from Boeing, the aerospace group, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent, as did the Nasdaq Composite, in spite of a sharp fall in Google shares. After the Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark Fed funds rate by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent on Tuesday and warned that fresh rises ""may be needed"", some analysts indicated that the peak of the current cycle of monetary policy tightening might still be some way off. This was in spite of the release on Wednesday of firm but slightly weaker than expected data for manufacturing activity in January from the Institute for Supply Management. Ed Yardeni, strategist at Oak Associates, said: ""The Fed isn't done. I see two more 25 basis point hikes to 5.0 per cent over the next two FOMC meetings."" However, David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said: ""The current rate-hiking cycle is on its last legs, which is a good thing for financial assets in general."" Merrill Lynch pointed out that the cumulative 350 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate in the current cycle of increases represented ""the most intense tightening campaign in a quarter-century"". Many analysts are looking to the release on Friday of US payrolls data for January for signals of rate policy. Binit Patel, economist at Goldman Sachs, said that although job market conditions were expected to ease as the year progressed, his bank had forecast 300,000 additions to non-farm payrolls in January compared with a market consensus of about 240,000. Stephen Lewis, analyst at Monument Securities, said attention was now shifting to Mr Bernanke's testimony to Congress on February 15 amid speculation about how the new chairman would handle a crisis. ""The markets are already several hours into the post-Greenspan era and there have been no crises yet. Even so, a strong presumption is developing among investors that there will be a financial crisis soon, on the grounds that this is what usually happens early in the tenure of a Fed chairman,"" he said. ""There are not all that many observations on which to base such a generalisation."" Across the Atlantic, eurozone bond yields rose in line with US treasuries in spite of the release of weaker-than-expected manufacturing data for the region. The rise came amid speculation that the European Central Bank might signal an increase in its benchmark interest rate today from the current 2.25 per cent. European shares made solid gains on a flurry of takeover speculation, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gaining 1.04 per cent to a fresh four-and-a-half-year high of 1,333.32. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed above 5,800 for the first time since June 2001. In Asia, Tokyo broke a six-day streak of gains with the Nikkei 225 Average falling 1 per cent to 16,480.09. Mumbai came within 6 points of hitting the 10,000 mark on the BSE 30 Index. "

As Ben Bernanke was sworn in as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, there was speculation that the central bank would tighten monetary policy further than many previously expected. This lifted the dollar against the euro and yen, weakened treasuries and restrained equities. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,913.13.

425,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Bernanke takes the helm at the Fed.,"Ben Bernanke took over on Wednesday as chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors and its policymaking Federal Open Market Committee. He is the 14th chairman since the US central bank's founding in 1913. A smooth transition is expected. Mr Bernanke, who was a Fed governor from 2002 until last summer, when he became chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, is a widely respected economist whose broad approach to policymaking is expected to be very similar to that of Alan Greenspan, who stood down on Tuesday. Mr Bernanke took the oath of office in the Fed's office at the start of the day, sworn in by Roger Ferguson, the Fed's vice-chairman. He has a four-year term as chairman and a 14-year term as a member of the board. Mr Greenspan, who chaired his last FOMC meeting on Tuesday, led the Fed for 18l years. Mr Bernanke has stressed the importance of continuity at the Fed - hardly surprising after the strong performance of the economy during his predecessor's long tenure - but also made clear at his confirmation hearings that he remained committed to introducing a more formal definition of the Fed's inflation objective. Rather than a radical change, that commitment can be seen as a continuation of the gradual shift to greater transparency at the Fed that has been gaining pace in recent years. On Tuesday the Fed raised interest rates for the 14th time by a quarter-point to 4.5 per cent. Its accompanying statement further toned down the language on the likelihood of further rate increases, to avoid the appearance of tying Mr Bernanke's hands. The committee noted that inflation pressures remained a concern and it judged that ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep growth and inflation in balance. Mr Bernanke will deliver testimony before Congress on February 15 on behalf of the FOMC and update lawmakers on the central bank's outlook, when he presents twice-yearly monetary report to Congress. He will chair his first FOMC meeting at the end of March, at which investors are pricing in a high probability of another quarter-point increase, expected to be the last in the long series of rate increases that started in 2004. However, a number of prominent forecasters expect strong growth in the economy and concerns about inflation to prompt a further rate increase in May. Fed policymakers shrug-ged off the slowdown in the economy in the fourth quarter and expect the it to continue to expand this year at close to its trend rate - commonly put at 3-3.5 per cent - following growth of 3.5 per cent for the whole of 2005. One of the key uncertainties in the outlook is the impact that signs of a slowing housing market might have on consumer spending. Futures market pricing and the flat yield curve suggests that investors expect the Fed to have to cut interest rates from their peak level by the end of this year. One question is whether Mr Bernanke will seek to address such expectations in his testimony in two weeks. In contrast to past tightening cycles, when the Fed was trying to slow the economy below its trend rate to reduce inflation, on this occasion the central bank described its strategy as seeking to return rates to a more normal footing. That objective follows the emergency action taken in the wake of the bursting of the stock market, the September 11 attacks, and other shocks that hit the economy, to keep inflation expectations contained. "
426,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Insight: Bernanke faces early test.,"In his State of the Union address, President George W.?Bush spoke of the pre-eminence of the US economy. He did not mention the contribution to that status of Alan Greenspan, who the same evening stepped down after more than 18 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Perhaps Mr Bush thinks the Fed is bigger than any figurehead. The markets seem to share that view, so far. Reaction to Tuesday's rate rise by the Federal Open Market Committee was as measured as the steady upward march of short-term rates that began in June 2004. The message accompanying the FOMC's action surprised few, ensuring a smooth handover of the chairmanship to Ben Bernanke, who was sworn in yesterday morning. The FOMC removed its reference to the need for further ""measured"" tightening, and said additional increases ""may be needed"". They had previously been billed as ""likely"". ""What's the difference? Perhaps an implication that the Fed has less bias?.?.?.?and will investigate data that 'may' support additional tightening, or may not,"" said Barbara Rockefeller, president of Rockefeller Treasury Services. The game theorists say Mr Bernanke will have to raise rates at least once more when he chairs his first FOMC meeting on March 28 to establish credibility. Fed funds futures contracts are pricing in a better than even chance of that. Others are not so sure. ""A move at Mr Bernanke's first meeting?.?.?.?will not hinge on his desire to flash his anti-inflation credentials or his need to carry on what Alan Greenspan started,"" said David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch. ""Remember, this is the decision of an entire committee, and it would seem a 'wait and see' consensus has finally been cobbled together."" The debate over future rate increases is intensifying because most economists believe the Fed funds rate is now at or near a level that is neutral, neither stoking growth nor stifling it. That has allowed the FOMC to change its message in recent months, and - coincidentally - to leave Mr Bernanke with a relatively free hand. The flexibility only exists because the FOMC's next move is not obvious. This could mean Mr Bernanke's ability to build a consensus among committee members will be tested early. Whether rates go up again or not, he will have to convince the markets he has done the right thing. His views are documented, but Mr Bernanke's style at the Fed remains to be seen. Ed Yardeni, chief investment officer at Oak Associates in the US, noted the new chairman's background as a Princeton academic: ""That's the sort of job that requires herding rather than leadership skills. Mr Bernanke is likely to be more of a consensus builder than a domineering leader. I don't know if this will be good or bad. It will just be different from what we all are used to."" As for managing the market's expectations, early hints could emerge in a fortnight's time when Mr Bernanke is due to present the Fed's twice-yearly monetary policy report to the US Congress for the first time. The new Fed chairman is known to favour transparency in policymaking. But Mr Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch doubts that the Fed would make its thinking completely clear, even if it were inclined to hold rates steady. ""Bottom line as Fed policymaker is that you don't lay down your cards all at once,"" he said. ""The threat of another tightening is there, but not necessarily at the next meeting."" Maintaining the Fed's inflation-beating credibility will be a priority. Market confidence in the US central bank has helped damp volatility, keep longer-term bond yields low and shrink risk premiums on investments in equity and debt in the US and further afield. Kingsmill Bond, head of global emerging markets strategy at Deutsche Bank, sees no reason for that to change. ""Only time will tell, but the gradual increase in Fed Funds rates and low long-term yields have kept the external environment very supportive for emerging markets,"" he said. ""With the US economic growth outlook still solid, we see little risk of a marked change in this scenario under a Bernanke-led Fed."" "
427,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar gains as market eyes March rate rise.,"The US dollar rose on Wednesday as the market concluded that Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement increased the probability of a March interest rate increase. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates by a quarter of a point for the fourteenth consecutive meeting, taking rates to 4.5 per cent. The accompanying statement said that further tightening ""may be needed"". Although this was softer language than the phrase ""is likely to be needed"" that featured in the FOMC's December statement, the wording was taken to mean that the committee was minded to put into effect a further rate rise in March. The futures market is pricing in an 84 per cent probability of such an outcome. ""The new wording still implies a bias towards further tightening,"" said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics, although he still expected a housing-led slowdown to send rates sliding to 3 per cent by the end of 2007. Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, was more hawkish: ""The FOMC erred on the side of tightening. We expect incoming economic data to justify not one but two 0.25 point increases before the FOMC decides to pause."" The dollar rose as high as $1.2075 to the euro, a cent above its level prior to the FOMC statement. However, the gains were pared on the release of soft US economic data. A slide in pending home sales in December to the lowest levels in two years allied to weak mortgage approvals revived fears over the state of the housing sector. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index managed to combine a weaker headline reading with rising inflationary pressures, echoing last week's gross domestic product data. ""The cracks are starting to appear. Inflation numbers are a little bit on the high side but activity data is starting to show some weakness,"" said Ian Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas. Mr Stannard believes the data remain consistent with one more rate rise, but he forecasts a cut by the end of the year, a view starting to be factored into the futures market. The dollar slipped back to $1.2087 to the euro by mid-session in New York trade and sat at Y117.92 to the yen, a gain of 0.9 per cent since the FOMC statement, and $1.7780 against sterling, a rise of 0.3 per cent. Sterling exhibited broad strength, rising 0.5 per cent to GBP0.6797 to the euro and 0.5 per cent to Y209.65 against the yen, a seven-week high. The pound was supported by talk of sterling-positive merger and acquisition flows, with Lloyds TSB and Unilever reportedly on the block, as well as a solid manufacturing survey. The Canadian dollar remained firm at C$1.1406 to the greenback, within 0.3 cents of the 14-year high it set late on Tuesday. With speculative positioning still unstretched, Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Calyon, suggested the loonie, which has risen alongside commodity prices and Toronto's buoyant equity market, ""may continue to push higher over the short term"". He said the currency had outperformed weak natural gas prices in recent weeks, breaking a correlation that existed in 2005. ""With potential for some catch-up with the drop in natural gas prices, the Canadian dollar will look increasingly vulnerable over coming weeks."" The South Korean won hit another eight-year high of won957.3 to the dollar, despite a pull-back in Seoul's equity market, before slipping to won962 amid suspected central bank intervention. Inflation came in at 0.8 per cent month on month in January, leading HSBC to predict a Korean rate rise a week today, supporting its bullish view on the won. "
428,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar gains as market eyes March rate rise.,"The US dollar rose in European morning trade on Wednesday as Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement opened the door to a March rate rise. As widely expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates by a quarter of a point for the 14th straight meeting, taking short-term rates to 4.5 per cent. However most attention was on the accompanying statement, which said further tightening ""may be needed"". Although this was softer language than the phrase ""is likely to be needed"" that figured in the FOMC's December statement, the wording was taken as suggesting that the committee is minded to implement one further rate rise in March, with the futures market pricing in an 80 per cent probability of such an outcome, compared to 75 per cent prior to the statement. ""The new wording still implies a bias towards further tightening,"" said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics, although he still expected a housing-led slowdown to send rates spiralling to 3 per cent by the end of 2007. A more hawkish Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, said: ""The FOMC erred on the side of tightening. We fully expect incoming economic data to justify not one but two 0.25-point increases before the FOMC decides to pause."" Such sentiment supported the dollar, which rallied to $1.2096 against the euro, 0.75c better than prior to the statement, Y117.51 against the yen, a rise of Y0.60, and $1.7763 against sterling, a gain of 0.7c. The greenback also firmed to C$1.1414 against the Canadian dollar, recovering from the fresh 14-year low of C$1.1379 it hit on Tuesday. With speculative positioning still unstretched, Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Calyon, suggested the Canadian dollar, which has risen alongside commodity prices and Toronto's buoyant equity market, ""may continue to push higher over the short term"". However Mr Kotecha saw the loonie looking more vulnerable in the weeks ahead. ""One of the biggest drivers of the Canadian dollar over 2005 was natural gas prices, but the correlation with the currency has effectively collapsed over recent weeks, saving it from the negative influence of the sharp fall in natural gas prices recently,"" he said. ""With potential for some catch up with the drop in natural gas prices, the Canadian dollar will look increasingly vulnerable over coming weeks."" Elsewhere sterling made some gains on Wednesday as the UK's manufacturing purchasing managers' index ticked up from 51.3 in December to 51.7 in January, better than expected. Employment growth fell below the 50 break-even level, but rising output prices hinted at inflationary pressures, reducing the scope for looser monetary policy. In contrast, the equivalent measure for the eurozone missed expectations, dipping a fraction from December's reading. As such, the pound firmed 0.25p to GBP0.6809 against the euro and Y0.2 to Y208.75 against the yen. The South Korean won hit yet another eight-year high of Won957.3 to the dollar, despite a pullback in Seoul's equity market, before slipping back to Won962 amid suspected central bank intervention. Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, said a 0.8 per cent month-on-month rise in consumer prices in January ""suggests that the central bank will remain focused on inflation, suggesting rates will move up keeping the won supported. We see further won upside potential against the dollar and the yen."" "

After initial losses, the blue-chip FTSE 100 moved 0.5 per cent higher to 5,789.7 as bid speculation surrounded high-street bank Lloyds TSB, with Spanish banking giant BBVA and Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup of the US named a possible suitors. BBVA refused to comment on the rumours, though traders noted a bid for LLoyds might might be a stretch for the bank currently looking to expand in the Italian market. Shares in Lloyds rose7.2 per cent to 546lp as talk suggested that such a bid could be priced at around 700p a share.

432,2009-12-16,2009-12-17,Financial Times,The Short View,"There remain plenty of investors who worry about inflation, not least those still buying gold. However, it is one risk Ben Bernanke and fellow members of the US policy-making Federal Open Market Committee are not concerned about. Statements from the FOMC's monthly meetings have stressed ""subdued inflation"" more than once. Certainly the current inflation picture does not contain much to worry about. The US Consumer Price Index in November rose 0.4 per cent from the previous month. The comparisons with a year ago are not meaningful because those include the effects of a plunge in oil prices (remember, oil fell from more than $145 a barrel in July 2008 to less than $35 a barrel by December). Core CPI - which strips out energy costs - did not rise at all in November in the US. The rises in the overall headline figure largely reflect the higher oil and other energy prices. The cost of oil will be a key factor to watch next year. There can be no doubt that central bankers are eyeballing it too. Indeed, it is likely that the recent halt of oil's rally at around $70 per barrel has come as a relief. For, in the same way that a rise in long-term interest rates can choke off a recovery because it makes it more difficult or expensive for companies to obtain credit and fund their businesses, high oil prices and the resultant higher costs of transportation as gasoline costs rise can dampen economic growth. In 2008, oil prices continued to surge even as economies were slowing down and there has continued to be a debate about just how much of that was due to speculators. There are plenty of signs that speculative pressures are less now than they were. Nevertheless, another huge run up in oil cannot be ruled out. Even as core inflation remains benign, fragile economies can be knocked back by various type of price surges, oil being one of them. John Authers is on sabbatical Video: www.ft.com/shortview"
433,2009-12-16,2009-12-17,Financial Times (FT.Com),Investors flee from risk,"The dollar was the chief beneficiary of a sharp spike in risk aversion Thursday as the markets digested Wednesday's policy statement from the Federal Reserve. Adding to the uncertain mood were fresh concerns about the eurozone periphery following another downgrade to Greece's sovereign debt rating. The US currency climbed to a three-month high against the euro and gained ground against most other leading currencies after the US central bank offered a more upbeat assessment of economic conditions. But some strategists were sceptical that the dollar's strength was a reflection of investors bringing forward US interest rate expectations, pointing instead to technical buying related to extended short positions. US rate futures implied a 58 per cent chance that the Fed would raise its target by 25 basis points by the middle of next year compared with 48 per cent immediately after the FOMC statement. But analysts also noted that the three-month dollar London interbank rate had been set at a record low of 0.254 per cent. Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, pointed out that credit markets were of crucial importance in gauging expectations of a US interest rate rise. ""In the last tightening cycle, the first rate hike did not occur until June 2004 but Libor began moving higher two full months earlier,"" he said. ""Keeping an eye on this market can only serve one well when gauging market expectations pertaining to a hike."" Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon, said the important element of the statement was that it highlighted the distinction between the Fed's rate and quantitative easing policies and signalled a cautious move towards an exit strategy. ""Ultimately, the Fed's liquidity exit strategy is determined by liquidity conditions in the financial system and the functioning of core markets of systemic importance, not by the traditional macro policy assessment,"" she said. ""Based on the strength of the economy and the prospects for inflation, the Fed is still a long way away from asset sales and conventional rate hikes."" US government bonds showed few signs of concern about a Fed rate rise following the US central bank's pledge to keep rates ""exceptionally low"" for an ""extended period"". The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled 11bp to 3.48 per cent while the two-year yield fell 8bp to 0.75 per cent, keeping the spread between the two maturities just below the record 276bp that was struck on Wednesday. Three-month T-Bill yields hovered near 2009 lows. By contrast, the yield on Greece's 10-year bond jumped as much as 30bp before easing back to stand 19bp higher at 5.69 per cent, with the premium over German Bunds widening 24bp to 256bp. Late on Wednesday, Standard & Poor's cut the country's long-term sovereign rating from A minus to triple B plus and warned of possible further action. Rival agency Fitch downgraded Greece this month. ""While the impact of what the economy of Greece contributes to the eurozone is relatively tiny at around 3-4 per cent, there is still a monetary relationship between Frankfurt and Athens,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. ""The association is causing international investors concern and fans the embers of the argument that the eurozone might fall apart at the first signs of economic crisis."" The broad rise in risk aversion weighed heavily on US and European equity indices with banking stocks leading the way down. The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.3 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 reversed an early rise to finish 0.1 per cent lower. The Vix volatility index, often called Wall Street's fear gauge, was up 11 per cent at 22.72 while the Markit CDX index of US investment-grade credit default swaps widened after hitting its lowest level since May 2008 on Wednesday. In commodities, the strength of the dollar sent gold tumbling 3 per cent and the it tested support at the $1,100 level. Benchmark US oil fell more than $1 before regaining some of its losses by the close."
434,2005-02-02,2005-02-03,Financial Times,Fed raises rates to 2.5% as growth seen above trend.,"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.5 per cent yesterday and signalled no change in its outlook. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement virtually unchanged from its December meeting. It said that even after yesterday's rate increase, ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative"" and repeated that it expects to continue raising rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Yesterday's decision was widely expected and there was little financial market reaction. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, will give his twice-yearly testimony before Congress on behalf of the FOMC on February 16 and 17, in which he will update the committee's views. The central bank has made very clear that it expects to continue raising rates to a more neutral level. Investors are pricing in a 3.5 per cent federal funds rate at the end of the year. Federal Reserve policy-makers are increasingly confident that the US economy has entered a self-sustaining phase of above-trend growth. In spite of some upside risks, inflation pressures are seen as well contained. The economy grew by 4.4 per cent last year although growth in the fourth quarter was slower than expected, at a 3.1 per cent rate on the government's advance estimate. But this reflected the drag of the trade deficit: net exports subtracted 1.7 percentage points from the growth rate at the end of the year. Risks associated with the large US current account and fiscal deficits, and the possibility of a destabilising financial market reaction, are a matter for concern at the Fed, but those deficits are not a direct target of central bank policy. Long-term interest rates are lower now than when the Fed started its tightening cycle last summer. While the dollar has weakened over the past two-and-a -half years, there were only limited signs of this feeding into inflation. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation - the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes food and energy items - rose by 1.5 per cent in the 12 months to December, down from 1.6 per cent in November. That is right in the middle of the presumed Fed comfort range of 1-2 per cent for the core PCE index. The special subjects of the two-day meeting were the pros and cons of introducing a formal inflation objective. A guide to that discussion will be available when the meeting's minutes are released in three weeks. Mr Greenspan may give a preview in his testimony, or other Fed policymakers in their public appearances. The central bank is keen that the policy statement that accompanies rate decisions remains the chief communication tool, rather than the minutes, which are seen as a less reliable guide. FOMC members are broadly comfortable with the pace of future rate increases being priced in by the market, and there are concerns that the uncertain outlook for productivity growth makes it difficult for the central bank to forecast the inflation outlook. "
435,2005-02-02,2005-02-03,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar higher as eurozone holds rates.,"The US dollar moved higher on Thursday, although why it did so was less clear. Most analysts and traders cited the improving yield differential of the US, with the European Central Bank on Thursday holding its key repo rate at 2 per cent just a day after the Federal Reserve sanctioned a 25-basis point rise to 2.5 per cent. Yet no one should have been unduly surprised by these developments, or indeed the simultaneous clues as to the future direction of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee's universally expected hike was accompanied by a near identical statement to that given after December's meeting. ""The statement was a virtual copy of its predecessor,"" said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York. Likewise the 20th straight month of inaction from the ECB came as no surprise, while some viewed the subsequent comments of Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the ECB, as more hawkish than expected. Sean Callow, currency strategist at IdeaGlobal, took such a view, alluding to Mr Trichet's comments about a pick-up in loan growth. ""The impression is of a slightly more hawkish stance from the ECB,"" he said. Others saw Mr Trichet's comment that inflation is likely to fall below the ECB's 2 per cent target later this year as a dovish signal, although it is a message that has been delivered before. ""ECB rate hike expectations are likely to be priced out,"" said Tania Kotsos, forex strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""With rate rises expected at the next three FOMC meetings, the yield gap is likely to be 125 basis points by the end of June."" Steven Englander, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital, sees this as crucial. ""For lack of alternative themes and in the absence of inflation pressures, markets continue to buy yield,"" he said. Mr Englander's number-crunching suggests average 10-year bond spreads between the three highest yielding G10 currencies (Australia and New Zealand dollars and sterling) and the three lowest yielders (yen, euro and Swiss franc) have widened by 15 basis points since January 17, with the high-yielding currencies appreciating by 2.75 per cent, on average. With such sentiment to the fore, the US dollar rose 0.6 per cent to $1.2956 to the euro, approaching its strongest levels since November, 0.9 per cent to Y104.64 against the yen and 0.3 per cent to $1.8794 against sterling. A 2 per cent jump to R6.1213 against the rand was a particularly attributable to the yield argument, amid hints that South African interest rates could be cut once again. Sterling was buoyed by firm data, with the UK service sector purchasing managers' index rising to 55.9 in January, a point above December's level, and the Halifax house price index showing a 0.8 per cent rise in house prices in January. ""This report will be seized upon by those predicting a soft landing for the housing market and will certainly reinforce growing expectations that an early cut in interest rates is unlikely,"" said Ed Stansfield at Capital Economics. This allowed the pound to firm 0.7 per cent to Y196.66 against the yen and 0.5 per cent to SFr against the Swiss franc. The Polish zloty pushed through the 4-zloty barrier to the euro for the first time since January 2003, its move to 3.9721 cementing a rise of 2 per cent in two days. The move was largely propelled by Wednesday's admission from Jerzy Hausner, the Polish economy minister, that his government's ability to control the exchange rate was limited. This led to speculative flows into the zloty, with traders eyeing what appeared to be a one-way bet. Mr Hausner on Thursday called for a rate cut to stem zloty strength. However RBC's Ms Kotsos speculated Miroslaw Gronicki, the finance minister, would be willing to see the zloty rise to 3.8 to the euro. "
436,2005-02-02,2005-02-03,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar range-bound after Fed and Bush.,"Major currencies were once again constrained in tight ranges in European morning trade on Thursday as Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting and President Bush's State of the Union address threw up no surprises. Not for the first time, much of the excitement emanated from eastern Europe, with the Polish zloty breaking a key resistance level to soar to a two-year high. The Federal Open Market Committee's widely anticipated decision to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.5 per cent was accompanied by a near identical statement to that proffered after December's meeting. ""The statement was a virtual copy of its predecessor, with the phrase 'policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured' firmly in place,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York. Similarly Mr Bush's set-piece event also left the market cold, as it shed little fresh light on his administration's plans for reducing the burgeoning budget deficit. ""Bush's state of the union speech left little impression upon the dollar,"" said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas. ""Bush's commitment to eliminate more than 140 government programmes and limit spending growth for other programmes to the rate of inflation provided little new information."" Mr Redeker also argued that the president's mention of diplomacy towards both Iran and North Korea kept risk aversion in check. There were some dissenters from this view, with Monica Fan, global head of forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets, arguing that the address was bearish for the dollar. Ms Fan pointed to a warning that the social security budget is heading for ""bankruptcy"" and fears that military spending will remain high as ""Iran and Syria have moved to the centre of the US government's attention."" But with most of the market drawing little impetus from these events, and traders wary of increasing their exposure ahead of Friday, which brings US non-farm payroll data, a speech from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on the US current account deficit and the start of the meeting of the G7, major currencies were little moved. As a result the dollar was little changed at $1.3020 against the euro and Y103.95 versus the yen, although it did fall 0.3c to $1.8876 against sterling. The pound was buoyed by firm data releases, with the UK service sector purchasing managers' index rising to 55.9 in January, a point above December's level. Furthermore, the Halifax house price index showed a seasonally-adjusted 0.8 per cent rise in house prices in January, backing the findings of the rival Nationwide survey, which also showed a pick-up in January. ""The report will be seized upon by those predicting a soft landing for the housing market and will certainly reinforce growing expectations that an early cut in interest rates is unlikely,"" said Ed Stansfield, property economist at Capital Economics. Sterling firmed 0.2p to GBP0.6898 against the euro and Y0.9 to Y196.17 versus the yen. Elsewhere, the Polish zloty pushed through the 4-zloty barrier to the euro for the first time since January 2003, its move to 3.9834 zlotys cementing a rise of around 1.75 per cent in less than two days. The move was largely propelled by Wednesday's admission from Jerzy Hausner, the Polish economy minister, that his government's ability to control the exchange rate was limited and that the zloty might therefore strengthen further. This led to further speculative flows into the zloty, with traders eyeing what appeared to be a one-way bet. ""Mr Hausner has achieved exactly the opposite of what he would be happy with,"" said Elisabeth Gruie, forex strategist at BNP. The zloty held onto its gains despite Mr Hausner saying on Thursday that he expected the central bank to alter monetary policy to stem zloty strength. "
437,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"A squeeze in stock index futures at the close of trading enlivened what had been an erratic session in derivatives. The late rally in futures fuelled strong buying of the underling FT-SE 100 Index ahead of the close of the stock market, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,211, which was about 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 10 points, with the strong finish attributed to a late advance in UK gilts. Volume at the official close was 10,275 lots. Bonds had also been firmer earlier in the day when June opened at 3,208, and good buying drove the contract to the day's peak of 3,229. However, a bout of nervous trading ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting saw June surrender early gains and it fell to a low of 3,183 in the early afternoon. In Liffe FT-SE Mid-250, June traded 97 contracts and it closed at 3,850. The screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX. In Liffe traded options, turnover improved to 43,697 contracts ahead of today's expiry of the March stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,973 lots and 2,594 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid speculation made Argyll Group the busiest stock option with a total of 4,530 lots. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
438,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - US TREASURIES JUMP AS FED NUDGES RATES HIGHER.,"US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon amid relief that the Federal Reserve had ended weeks of anticipation by signalling a small increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/32 higher at 92 11/32, with the yield easing by about 10 basis points to 6.853%. At the short end, the two-year note was 7/32 better at 99 11/32, to yield 4.948%. The rally, especially at the short end of the yield curve, was surprising. It suggested that the market had already factored a rate increase into bond prices. News of the move came in a mid-afternoon announcement by the Fed that its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase 'slightly' reserves in the banking system. Analysts interpreted the statement as an indication that the FOMC had voted to lift its target for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%. Early on, bond traders were content to remain on the sidelines until the Fed made clear its intentions. Prices across the yield curve were showing moderate improvement in light trading before the announcement. The reaction to the Fed's decision was immediate. Institutional investors poured money into the market, suggesting that yields, after moving markedly higher over the past few weeks, were attractive at current levels. The results of the Treasury's auction of $17bn in new two-year notes suggested as much. The offering, which was awarded at 5.15% only minutes before the Fed's move, drew good demand even though confusion over monetary policy still reigned. European government bond markets pared their gains yesterday afternoon following early indications that the US Fed might leave monetary policy unchanged. Analysts had been surprised by the Fed's lack of action in the morning session, since most traders had expected it to sanction a rise of a quarter-point in the Fed funds rate to 3.5%. The lack of a morning move by the Fed extended the markets' long vigil for evidence that European bonds were in the process of de-coupling from the US market. Analysts said that if the Fed had left monetary policy unchanged, it would have been easier for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate today. The market had expected the Bundesbank to lower the rate by up to eight basis points from 5.88%. UK gilts generally outperformed other European government bond markets, supported by hopes of favourable inflation data for February due to be released today. The market expects a monthly rise of 0.4% in the retail prices index, bringing the annual rate, excluding mortgages, down to 2.6% from 2.8% in January. Media reports of a Gallup poll showing consumer confidence at a four-year low also supported gilt prices since the findings kept hopes of a further cut in interest rates alive. The June long gilt future on Liffe traded at 109 in the late afternoon, up 17/32 on the day, off the day's high of 109 31/32 but well up on the worst level of 109 5/32. Analysts expressed disappointment at the size of the Bank of England's first floating-rate gilt for 15 years. They had been confident that the novelty value of the issue would encourage the Bank to set the amount at between #3bn to #3.5bn. However, the Bank chose to raise only #2.5bn, indicating to the market that it was comfortable with its funding programme. The other terms of the issue were in line with market expectations - a minimum price of 99.50, a coupon of three-month Libid less 1/8 point and a five-year maturity. German government bond prices see-sawed after news of the Fed's inaction. The June bund future on Liffe stood just under a half-point higher at 96.45 in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.60 but off the low of 95.84. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
439,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FED LIFTS INTEREST RATES.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed US interest rates are on a gradual upward path when it tightened monetary policy for the second time in two months, writes Philip Gawith. The Fed did not specify the extent of the move, but it was taken for granted in the market that the announcement involves a 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, to 3.50%. This follows a similar rise to 3.25% on February 4th. The tightening had been largely discounted in the market and there was little reaction. The dollar rose just over half a pfennig to trade at DM 1.6870 from DM 1.68 before the announcement. It was little changed against the yen hovering at the Y 106 level. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman, said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had decided to increase pressure on bank reserves in order to raise interest rates. 'This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates,' said Mr Greenspan. The announcement was made after the FOMC meeting at 19h20 GMT. Attention will now switch to the Bundesbank which is today expected to announce a further cut in its repo rate. The combination of a rise in US rates and a lowering of German rates could well give the dollar a significant upward lift. In the UK, meanwhile, the release of the February retail price index is keenly awaited. Some observers believe a good number could trigger a cut in interest rates, but this is a minority view. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's action 'confirms that Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode. The strong implication is that it is a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, not an increase in the (more significant) discount rate.' Mr Hannah said the nature of the Fed's move also 'adds a degree of predictability about the timing of Fed interest rate moves. This could help the markets to settle down a bit.' The February 4th tightening - the first increase in US rates in five years - sent financial markets into turmoil with bond yields rising sharply in all western countries. For the second time in a row the central bank acted after an FOMC meeting, in the process also showing that it was not responding to specific economic data. The IBJ analyst described the Fed's move as 'not so much tightening as normalising on a gradualist path.' Mr Greenspan made clear in February that he felt real interest rates had fallen to abnormally low levels. The timing of the move caught the market slightly off-guard. Earlier in the day the Fed had, in its normal open market operations, added reserves with two-day system repos which suggested no change in monetary policy. This led many to believe that the Fed would not act until today. The dollar continues to be wrapped in bearish sentiment. With last night's Fed tightening already in the market, one view was that the fate of the dollar was more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), commented: 'What really matters is if the Fed can tighten in tandem with a Bundesbank move. That is the only thing that will lend significance to a 25 basis point Fed tightening.' Ahead of the Fed announcement, the D-Mark was firmer across the board in Europe. It closed at FFr 3.418 from FFr 3.407 on Monday against the French franc. Analysts warned that if the Bundesbank did not quicken the pace of monetary easing, the steady weakening over the past week of the franc could continue. The Bundesbank announced it was holding another variable rate repo. The lowest bid accepted last week was 5.88%, a reduction of six basis points in the repo rate. Analysts are predicting a fall of up to ten basis points. Overnight rates firmed slightly, from 5.70/5.80% to 5.80/5.90 ahead of the repo, but analysts doubted whether this would have any adverse effect. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, noted that the mid-point of the overnight rate was still below the repo rate and this normally favoured a larger drop in the repo rate. 'Banks tend to be quite ambitious on the bidding,' she said. Last week the overnight rate fell to the repo rate level only at the time of the auction. Sterling finished more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM 2.5094 from DM 2.5205. Traders said the UK currency was being affected by speculation about an interest rate cut. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan, warned there was a danger of a rate cut backfiring. If it upsets the gilts market, this will put upward pressure on mortgage rates. In the discount market the Bank of England dispatched a shortage of #750m without difficulty. Sterling futures firmed slightly with the June contract a basis point up at 94.85. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
440,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - BOURSES MARK TIME AWAITING US NEWS.,"European equity markets marked time yesterday in advance of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to raise the federal funds rate by from 3.25 to 3.50%, as they watched for clues from Washington. Before the close of trading on European bourses the only guidance available was that the committee was still reviewing economic conditions and had not yet discussed the direction it wanted to set for interest rates over the coming eight-week period. FRANKFURT consolidated its position with a day's gain in the Dax index of 10.06 to 2,141.34, but off from the session high of 2,155.31. Traders said that a weakening in the futures market contributed to the easing. Turnover was modest at DM 7.6bn. The banking sector attracted attention with further results due out in the next couple of weeks. James Capel, in a research note issued on Monday, noted that its forecasts for 1994-95 had been shaded down for two main reasons. It said: 'We have probably been too optimistic for the pace of recovery in terms of lending growth and falling bad debts.' The note added: 'This years trading profits have been adversely affected by the markets' reaction to the trend reversal in US interest rates'. Bayerishe Hypo, which pleased the market with results yesterday, added DM 1.50 to DM 469, while Bayerishe Vereinsbank, results due later this week, gained DM 2 to DM 491. Volkswagen, up DM 3.50 at DM 490.50, strengthened on hopes of good 1993 figures due tomorrow. ZURICH finished higher as domestic institutional buyers returned at current lower prices but the day's best levels were not maintained. The SMI index rose 20.4 to 2,824.7, after a high of 2,843.3. Ciba registered rose SwFr 40 to SwFr 855: the company has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a rival to Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Nestle, with results due this week put on SwFr 21 to SwFr 1,241. Sandoz, with results scheduled for tomorrow, rose SwFr 50 to SwFr 3,920 amid suggestions that the introduction of its Lescol cholesterol drug could spark a price war in the US. Georg Fischer rose SwFr 50 to SwFr 1,310: the mechanical engineering group said it expected to break even in this year after a 1993 loss of SwFr 34m. Holderbank rose SwFr 3 to SwFr 963 in response to its 12.3% rise in 1993 net profit. PARIS fell back from its session high in a volatile session, the CAC-40 index finally closing down 2.01 at 2,200.68. The index moved between a high of 2,222.52 and a low of 2,196.12. BNP, which the government said would have its stake in UAP cut from 19% to 15% as part of the insurers privatisation, lost FFr 2.70 to FFr 251.80. UAP was unchanged at FFr 189.90. AMSTERDAM drifted down, with the AEX index losing 1.91 to 414.33. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group, which repeated its forecast that 1994 earnings per share were set to rise, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 53.80. In a separate development PTT, the Dutch post and telephone utility, announced that its first tranche of shares could be floated on June 7. MILAN was steady, helped by the positive early tone in other European markets and having found technical support at Monday's lower levels. The Comit index edged 0.34 lower to 664.68 as election uncertainties remained at the centre of attention. Industrials led the way. Fiat rose L61 to L4,999, Pirelli L58 to L2,431 and Montedison L43 to L1,238. Olivetti put on L65 to L2,593 as hopes remained high for a swift decision on Italy's second mobile telephone licence. ISTANBUL fell 4.8%, wiping out Monday's gains, in uncertain trade ahead of Monday's local elections. The composite index lost 747.76 to 14,838. The elections are viewed as a key test of whether Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition government can be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis. Analysts agree that the election will be followed by sharp price rises as the government relaxes restraints on loss making state run companies, but observers are divided on what effect the polls will have on financial markets, hit by a plunging lira and soaring interest rates.

441,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - STOCKS REACT CALMLY TO FOMC RISE IN RATE.,"Wall Street US stocks reacted with relative calm yesterday to a signal by the Federal Reserve that it had decided to nudge up short-term interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.30 lower to 3,862.55, after jumping about seven points on the Fed's announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to add reserves to the banking system. Analysts said the statement was an indication that the central bank was lifting its target for the federal funds rate for the second time in two months. Other important market indices also showed little change on the day, defying forecasts of a sharp downturn on the news of a rate increase. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 was 0.26 better at 468.80, while the American SE composite inched 0.96 ahead to 471.73. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.95 to 796.35. NYSE volume, at 282m shares, was moderate. Advancing issues led declines, 1,015 to 929. Investors were tentative as the market opened, as attention was fixed on a policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Most analysts were expecting the members of FOMC to vote for a further tightening. But the morning brought no indication of a shift to tighter money, and blue-chip stocks, in parallel with bonds, moved moderately higher in early trading. The Fed's announcement finally came during the mid-afternoon and the reaction was immediate. In the bond market, prices across the yield curve jumped amid relief that the long-anticipated Fed action had finally come to pass. Stocks also improved, but the upturn was more modest and short-lived. By the close, the Dow industrials were barely changed on the day. Among individual issues, Alcoa added $1 1/2 to $78 3/8 and Disney was up $5/8 to $46 3/4, but Philip Morris lost $1 7/8 to $52 1/8 on news of a congressional recommendation to raise federal taxes on cigarettes. In pharmaceuticals, Merck dropped $1 5/8 to $30 1/2 on reports that its cholesterol-reducing drug would soon face competition from a cheaper product from Sandoz. Bristol-Myers Squibb, down $1 1/2 to $53 1/8, was also hit hard by the news. On the Nasdaq, investors showed a lack of confidence in Novell's decision to mount a challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the market for personal computer software. The stock slumped $3 3/4 to $20. Mexico Mexican stock prices rallied sharply after Mr Manuel Camacho Solis announced he would not run for the president, putting to rest speculation that has rattled the bolsa in recent weeks. The key IPC index of 36 leading shares gained 128.91 points or 5.41% to end at 2,511.92. It was the biggest one-day percentage rise since January 1991. Canada Toronto stocks closed higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 28.38 points, or 0.63%, to 4,551.88, with advances edging declines 424 to 423. Volume rose to 67.28m shares from 62.36 shares. Trading value was C$706.8m. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
442,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - FOOTSIE 3,200 MARK CHALLENGED IN NERVOUS TRADE - MARKET REPORT.","A highly-charged session saw the UK stock market struggle to hold on to the 3,200 mark on the FT-SE Index as it closed just ahead of the US Federal Reserve's decision to signal a modest rise in short-term interest rates. In mid-afternoon, the London stock market plunged sharply to a new trading low for the year of 3,186.9 in the face of a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was dominated throughout the day by the prospects for the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). London closed a few minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve's actions in the US money markets, and UK analysts were left to ponder the implications overnight. The session opened strongly, with UK government bonds leading equities ahead and interest rate confidence heartened in Europe by the Bundesbank announcement of another variable rate money market repos tender today. UK company news also continued to help sentiment, as Prudential, the UK life and general insurance group, joined the list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payment; but the Prudential share price became a casualty of the market setback later in the day. Although trading volume was unimpressive at this stage, the Footsie climbed by more than 22 points and the market appeared confident in spite of the uncertainty ahead of the FOMC meeting. But the stock market was halted in its tracks and then driven sharply downwards when the June futures contract on the Footsie ran into trouble. Although selling of the contract, still in its early days, was not heavy, the price quickly fell through the 3,200 mark and took the underlying stock market with it. Traders suspected that futures selling came from securities houses suddenly nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting. The stock market fell into important support territory before rallying, once again taking its lead from the stock index futures sector. Concern was expressed at the evident power of derivatives markets to influence the underlying stock market. In part, this reflected the lack of volume and nervousness in equities while bond markets remain so fickle. The FT-SE Index struggled back into positive territory to close at 3,201.5, a net gain of 3.5 on the day. London traders were then left on the sidelines to watch the response of the US credit markets to the Federal Reserve's actions which, it was then clear, were likely to lead to an early tightening in credit policies in the US. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend, ending the day with a loss of 1.4 at 3,853.1. Seaq volume picked up in the second half of the session to record a total of 678m shares, a third higher than on Monday, when retail business in equities was worth #1.19bn. The retail number, the most significant guide to genuine investment activity in the stock market, was at the lower end of daily averages for the past twelve months. While some Far Eastern stocks rebounded strongly behind the 4% upturn in the Hong Kong market, the rest of the UK market was unable to escape from the shadow cast ahead of the FOMC meeting. The erratic performance from bond markets over the past week has underlined the dependence of equities on the interest rate drama currently being acted out in Europe and the US.

443,2003-08-12,2003-08-13,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed decision leaves bonds mixed.,"Bond market reaction to the US Federal Reserve's latest interest rate announcement was mixed on Wednesday, with yields on short-dated European government bonds down but the long end of the curve up. The Fed, as expected, kept US rates steady at 1 per cent but indicated that it would keep rates low for a lengthy period to boost a recovery in the economy. Appearing to address recent volatility in the Treasury market, the Fed added that the risk of continued low inflation remained. Bond yields shot up following the Fed's meeting in late June because the central bank appeared to play down the threat of deflation it had previously raised. The Fed said that: ""The [Federal Open Market] Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future."" If the Fed wanted to steer market rates low, the statement did not appear to be an immediate success. Short-dated yields, which are more sensitive to interest rate expectations, fell on the prospect that rates would stay low for a protracted period. But long-dated rates, which are important for the huge mortgage market, and thus the wider economy, rose. European markets on Wednesday tracked the initial reaction in the Treasuries. Two-year German Schatz yields fell 1.2 basis point to 2.482 per cent, but 10-year Bund yields added 4.3bp at 4.115 per cent. Meanwhile, yields on all benchmark Treasury bonds were up. On the gilt market, yields on short-dated paper fell following the release of an unexpectedly dovish quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England. ""The overall risks to growth, and to a lesser extent, inflation are on the downside,"" the BoE said. The economy was likely to return to its trend rate of growth over the next couple of years, based on the assumption that interest rates would be maintained at their current level of 3.5 per cent, the Bank said. It added that inflation would drop back over the next year before edging back up above its 2.5 per cent target in about two years' time. Two-year gilt yields were 3bp lower at 3.953 per cent, while 10-year yields added 3bp at 4.449 per cent. "
444,2003-08-12,2003-08-13,Financial Times,Federal Reserve THE LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Open Market Committee made an effort to improve its communications following recent bond market volatility. As well as reiterating that the risks to growth are balanced and that the risks of inflation/ disinflation are skewed towards the latter, the statement added: ""In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period."" Above-trend growth will not automatically trigger pre-emptive tightening. The FOMC statement is a little more upbeat on growth and a little more downbeat on the labour market than in June. For Kremlinologists, the Fed substituted the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation"" for last time's ""an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation"" - perhaps in an attempt to reassure bond investors after the recent rise in yields. The result of a balanced growth outlook and the preponderance of disinflation over inflation risks is that ""the committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future"". What is a reasonable interpretation of the foreseeable future? In July's monetary policy report to Congress the FOMC published forecasts for 2003 and 2004, including inflation falling over the forecast horizon in spite of above-trend growth next year. The futures market has been pricing in an interest rate increase next spring. The Fed has sent a message. However, the reliance on wordplay rather than numbers - in the absence of a numerical range for what the FOMC regards as price stability - means the rules of the guessing game are imprecise. Flexibility comes at a cost. US Edition 2. "
445,2003-08-12,2003-08-13,Financial Times,Equity investors remain on the sidelines GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"Equity markets in the US and Europe showed little appetite for action yesterday ahead of the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee's interest rate decision. Confirmation that key rates would remain unchanged at their current 45-year lows was expected although its warning that the risks of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeded the risks of a pick-up provided a morsel of red meat for the markets to digest. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite, which on Monday snapped a six-session losing streak after upbeat investment calls on software companies, put on another 0.4 per cent. Attention will now turn to a raft of economic data due later in the week for clues on the outlook, including retail sales, consumer prices, industrial production and consumer confidence. European markets were higher for a fourth consecutive session but activity was light before the Fed's statement and with many investors away for August holidays. In early evening trade, the FTSE Eurotop 300 index was 0.7 per cent higher at 878.07. The run-up has taken the benchmark of Europe's largest companies to within 1 per cent of its highest level for seven months. Tokyo added to Monday's strong gains, helped by better-than-expected gross domestic product data. Japan's economy expanded 0.6 per cent in real terms in the April-June period for the sixth straight quarterly increase, above the 0.2-0.3 per cent consensus growth forecast for the quarter. Institutional fund managers expect worldwide bond yields to rise although they have not adopted an appreciably more optimistic view of the global economy, according to Merrill Lynch's influential fund managers' survey for August. A growing minority of fund managers viewed the monetary policies of the leading economies to be too stimulative and more managers expected the next move in the Federal Funds rate to be up than down. This view resulted in one of the most widespread underweightings of bonds that the survey has recorded. London Edition 1. "
446,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times,GLOBAL INVESTING - Treasuries rise as Fed hold rates.,"US government bonds rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said the pace of economic expansion remains uncertain. The FOMC meeting, as expected, resulted in no change to the Fed's policy or bias. The recent fall in stocks and a weak April employment report had earlier reinforced expectations that the Fed would keep the funds rate at 1.75 per cent. The Fed said yesterday that the risks remained ""balanced"" between price stability and economic growth. Economists expect the Fed to remain on hold through to June. Yesterday's data on non-farm productivity growth will support the Fed's decision. Although growth was stronger than expected, rising 8.6 per cent in the first quarter, unit labour costs fell - indicating that inflation remains benign. The market absorbed yesterday a quarterly refunding sale of $22bn five-year notes, which will be followed by a fresh $11bn in 10-year notes today. The two-year note gained 1/16 to 100 1/2 after the decision to yield 3.104 per cent, while the 10-year note was 5/32 higher at 98 21/32 with a yield of 5.047 per cent. The 30-year bond was up 1/8 to 97 to yield 5.532 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat in a choppy session as weak figures on the health of the German economy were offset by stronger equity markets. The number of jobless people in the eurozone's largest economy rose an unexpected 6,000 in April. In addition, German industrial orders fell by 0.1 per cent in March, pushing investors back into government bonds after many analysts had predicted a positive number. However, in the afternoon bond prices fell back after US productivity figures helped the equity markets. ""I think stocks will remain in the driver's seat for the next few days,"" said Nathalie Fillet, a government bond strategist at BNP Paribas in London. The two-year German schatz yield rose by half a basis point to 4.094 per cent, while the 10-year German bund yield was little changed at 5.111 per cent. The 10-year German bund futures contract price rose 0.05 to 106.16. In the UK, gilts tracked the US and European markets, with the 10-year gilt yield down slightly at 5.172 per cent. Japanese government bond prices rose, sending the 10-year yield to its lowest since late December on falling share prices and a strengthening yen. The yen rose to a two-month high on concern about the US economy, despite comments by Japanese officials, in which they said they were monitoring the US dollar-yen rate and were prepared to intervene if necessary. JGBs were also supported by a fall in the Japanese stock market. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 2 per cent to 11,316.04. The June futures contract rose 0.17 to 138.90. The benchmark 10-year No 238 cash JGB rose 0.130 to 100.390, pushing the yield down 0.015 to 1.355 per cent, the lowest since December 28. US Edition 1. "
447,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Fed continues dispensing medicine to a still-sick economy - Committee leaves rates at ...,"THE AMERICAS - Fed continues dispensing medicine to a still-sick economy - Committee leaves rates at 40-year low, although fears on inflation are beginning to rattle nerves, writes Peronet Despeignes. The Federal Reserve said yesterday inflation remained under control and signalled that short-term interest rates would stay at 40-year lows to help an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the colossal investment bust of the past two years. What the US central bank did not say was that economic data have been increasingly mixed and financial news dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq stock index, barometer of what is left of the ""new economy"", has over the past month sunk to levels not seen since the wake of the September 11 terror attacks. America's economic recovery is, once again, in serious doubt, with inflation brewing as a potential problem over the coming year. The Fed's worst nightmare remains the prospect of a race between inflation and recovery - the possibility it will be forced into a Hobbesian decision to tighten the noose on money and credit to suppress inflation before clear signs emerge of a genuine recovery. That dilemma would leave its chairman Alan Greenspan - widely thought to be on his way towards a triumphant retirement - with an important, final challenge: navigating between the dual threats of renewed economic weakness and inflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) decided yesterday to leave short-term interest rates at a low of 1.75 per cent, where they have been since November. The general consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"" - in other words, adrenalin for a still-sick economy. The big question is how long it can remain so before risking an inflation problem. Mr Greenspan recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations the Fed will end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could wreck this timetable. To the Fed's relief, inflation appears under control despite last year's dramatic monetary easing. According to the consumer price index, the 12-month trailing rate of inflation has slowed sharply in the past year from 3.5 per cent to just above 1 per cent. The implicit GDP deflator and deflator on personal consumption expenditures - considered better measures by Mr Greenspan - suggest inflation has slid below 1 per cent. While some prices - mainly for oil, gasoline and services such as housing, medical care and education - have surged and prices overall have stabilised, inflation appears generally subdued. However, economic indicators are backward-looking. The issue for the Fed is where inflation is heading from here and where markets expect it to go. A key determinant is the nation's productivity miracle. Figures released yesterday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy keeps producing more with less. But the persistence of the slump in stock prices and in investment in labour-saving technologies, and the pick-up in government spending, have raised doubts about how long the productivity surge will last. Mr Greenspan said last month he did not expect high figures indefinitely: ""The world just doesn't work that well."" One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (Tips), has grown to a two-year high. Gold dollar prices have jumped and the dollar itself has slid recently - possible preliminary signs of weakening foreign demand for, and an inflationary oversupply of, US currency. Two prominent economic watchdogs have sent warnings. In its latest quarterly industry survey, the National Association of Business Economics, the largest group of corporate economists, said inflation pressures ""were developing"", evinced by ""widely reported"" price increases in services and raw materials. The Institute for Supply Management said purchasing managers were reporting strong growth in costs, with service-sector executives reporting that their costs ""had increased at the fastest rate in 11 months"". A sign of the emerging confusion and policy tensions was an extraordinarily public confrontation last month between a current and a former member of the FOMC at the April 25 annual economic conference of the Levy Economic Institute. Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, said that amid the unusual uncertainty, Fed policy action ""should be modest and infrequent"" to ""avoid destabilising the economy"". That prompted a stern warning from Laurence Meyer, an economist and former FOMC member, about the danger of being ""reactive"" and complacent on inflation - a possible omen of future divisions that are likely to widen if the ""productivity miracle"" falters and the economy does not recover quickly.

The FOMC meeting had been expected to be a ""non-event"", with no change in policy or bias. The recent fall in stocks and a weak April employment report had reinforced expectations that the Fed would keep the funds rate at 1.75 per cent. The Fed said yesterday that risks remained ""balanced"" between price stability and economic growth. Helping the Fed to keep rates unchanged yesterday were data on non-farm productivity growth. Although growth was stronger than expected, rising 8.6 per cent in the first quarter, unit labour costs fell - indicating that inflation remains benign. The market focused yesterday on the afternoon's quarterly refunding sale of five-year notes, which will be followed by a fresh $11bn in 10-year notes today. The two-year note was unchanged after the decision at 100 13/32, to yield 3.149 per cent, while the 10-year note was down 3/32 to 98 3/8 with a yield of 5.083 per cent.

449,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Heavyweight sectors drag FTSE 100 down again.,"The equitymarket's two-day rally, which was mostly triggered by strong performances from the oil majors and bank stocks, was damaged by London's catch-up after the bank holiday weekend. Monday's trading session in the US saw Wall Street under renewed and heavy downside pressure, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging back through the 10,000 level and the Nasdaq Composite on the slide to its lowest level since October last year. Both were damaged by worries about further casualties in the technology and telecom areas, and concerns about the extent of earnings recovery in the US. And although New York markets staged a rally yesterday afternoon, boosted by strong productivity data, the damage wrought on Monday was too much to repair in one London session. Dealers said the institutions had backed off from the market yesterday, preferring to wait for the outcome of the two interest rate decisions, from the US Federal Reserve's open market committee last night, and the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, expected at midday tomorrow. ""The overwhelming view is that we'll get no change here and no change in the US, but there could well be accompanying comments and the minutes of the last FOMC meeting will come out later this week as well,"" said one trader. At its worst of the day the FTSE 100 dropped below the 5,100 level, hitting a low of 5,082.7, down 120.4, before stabilising and staging a rally to finish the day a net 83.2 off at 5,119.9, its lowest closing level since February 28. The fall-out from the 100 index affected all areas of the market, with the Techmark 100 index, already on its knees because of the latest sell-off in the TMT sectors, sliding a further 14.01 to a record closing low of 1,047.77. The index remains well clear of its record intraday low which saw the measure only just escape falling below the 1,000 level. The FTSE 250 took plenty of punishment too, closing 44 lower at 6,126.2, after 6,119.2, while the FTSE SmallCap dipped 15.9 to 2,567.4. Both indices suffered from marked weakness in tech and related stocks. Leading London fallers yesterday were the heavyweight sectors that provided such stalwart support for the market recently - the oils, banks and pharmaceuticals. Oils were buffeted by selling sparked by the decline in crude oil prices as Iraq said it would resume crude oil sales after its month-long freeze. Weakness in BP and Shell accounted for about 23 points of downside in the FTSE 100, while bearish broker comments drove many of the banks lower. And the gloom surrounding the telecoms arena saw Vodafone shares drift back to their lowest level since January 1998 at one stage. despite support from a handful of brokers.

450,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times (FT.Com),Today's People on the Move.,"Bush nominates two more Fed board members A top adviser to Alan Greenspan and a highly regarded economics professor are to be nominated as members of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, as President George W. Bush extends the biggest reconstitution of the central bank's leadership in 60 years. President Bush will announce soon his intention to pick Fed economist Donald Kohn and Princeton University professor Ben Bernanke to fill two vacancies on the board. If they are approved by the Senate, Bush will have directly selected a third of the Fed's 12-seat, policy-making Open Market Committee. All board members sit on the FOMC. Bush won approval for the appointments of Susan Schmidt-Bies and Mark Olson last year. Not since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who built a reformed Federal Reserve board from scratch after the 1935 Banking Act, has any president had so much influence over the Fed's make-up in so short a time. ""It's unprecedented especially if Greenspan retires under Bush,"" said Tom Schlesinger, an expert on Fed history at the Financial Markets Centre. ""No president in the first two years of his term ever had as many board of governor openings."" Kohn, 59, is an official adviser to the Fed's board. He has worked closely with Greenspan, helping to devise monetary policy strategy. He was previously head of the Fed's Division of Monetary Affairs. Bernanke, 48, is an expert on monetary economics and chairman of the Princeton University economics department. He also sits on the recession-dating committee of the non-partisan National Bureau of Economic Research, which officially declared in November that the economy has slipped into a recession in March. If approved by the Senate, Kohn and Bernanke will fill seats left vacant by the departure of Laurence Meyer and Edward Kelley. Both would serve automatically as non-rotating members of the FOMC which, at full strength, is made up of seven board members selected by the President and five rotating regional Fed presidents elected by their regional boards. Peronet Despeignes Orchestream CEO resigns amid falling sales Orchestream, the UK internet software company, today announced the resignation of Ashley Ward, its chief executive, as it unv eiled three-month figures showing continuing deterioration in revenues. Orchestream said the resignation followed months of disagreement over business strategy between Ward, who had been CEO since mid 1998, and the rest of the Orchestream management which had now come to a head. The company said a successor would be announced within the coming weeks. In the interim period Ward's duties would be taken over by Anthony Finbow, chief financial officer, who was brought in earlier this year to improve cash collection. Alan Bates, chairman, said Ward's resignation was ""in the company's best long-term interests"". Ward's executive record had been mired during a year the company dubbed ""the most difficult year in the history of telecoms"". Full-year pre-tax losses ballooned to GBP35m in 2001 compared with GBP10.5m the previous year, while Orchestream's market capitalisation dwindled to GBP9.2m, compared to GBP873m at its height in 2000. Jonathan Loades-Carter Merrill Lynch creates new post James Quigley has been named senior vice-president of global client strategies at Merrill Lynch, a new position reflecting an emerging sales approach on Wall Street. The state-of-the-art sales pitch is based on offering a variety of solutions to business problems rather than a particular product. The focus is meant to cement relationships so banks can do more business with large clients over the long run. It favours bigger firms such as Merrill which can offer a variety of products. In his new client role, Quigley, 42, will report to the co-heads of the global markets and investment banking group, Arshad Zakaria and Paul Roy. He will also become the sixth member of the office of the chairman and president of Merrill Lynch International, the holding company for international businesses, a spokeswoman said. Quigley, who has worked at Merrill since 1983, was previously senior vice-president and head of client strategies for global debt markets. Before that he headed the global issuer client group in global debt markets, with responsibility for debt origination activities worldwide. Gary Silverman Public policy chief for UBS UBS, the financial services group, has appointed Jonathan Taylor as head of public policy, Europe. Based in London, Taylor will build up and co-ordinate relationships with policymakers, regulators and industry associations at European Union level. Experienced in European financial affairs in the UK Treasury and in Brussels, Taylor was financial counsellor at the UK's representation to the EU. BNP Paribas appoints head of euro corporate syndicate BNP Paribas has appointed Frederic Zorzi head of its euro corporate syndicate, fixed income. Zorzi, 34, who starts on May 27, joins from Lehman Brothers in London where he was a director and syndicate manager from 2000. For five years before that he worked at BNP in London. Earlier this month Hans Lentz was appointed head of BNP's financial institutions syndicate, fixed income.

451,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times (FT.Com),US productivity surges as Fed leaves rates alone.,"The Federal Reserve's policymaking Open Market Committee on Tuesday voted to keep short-term interest rates at a 40-year low of 1.75 per cent, signalling its continuing concern about the growth of the US economy. A statement following the vote said the decision was unanimous. The FOMC said that ""the strengthening of final demand"" over the next few months was ""still uncertain"", employing language identical to that in its March 19 statement. The interest rate announcement came a day before a likely White House announcement concerning the FOMC's membership. Analysts expect President George W. Bush to nominate Ben Bernanke and Donald Kohn to the two vacancies on the FOMC on Wednesday. Mr Bernanke is an economist at Princeton University, and Mr Kohn is a Federal Reserve economist and adviser to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Before Tuesday's rate decision, there had been some speculation the Fed might signal a shift toward raising rates. Instead, the FOMC sent a signal about its concerns over low growth, maintaining its assertion that the ""balance of risks"" facing the US remained evenly divided between economic weakness and higher inflation. The decision shows the US central bank finds it necessary to sustain aid to an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the investment decline of the past two years. It also comes amid renewed doubts about America's economic recovery. Recent economic data have been inconclusive while financial reports, particularly among technology companies, have remained generally dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq Composite over the past month has sunk to levels not seen since right after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"", acting as adrenaline for a weakened economy. The question remains as to how long monetary policy can be used as a stimulus before the Fed risks an inflation problem. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations for the Fed to end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could disrupt this timetable. The Fed's hope is that it will not face such a possibility before the economy is back on a solid growth path. Inflation appears under control in spite of last year's dramatic monetary easing. Inflation has generally slowed, according to most measures, from around 3.5 per cent to roughly 1 per cent. A key influence will be the staying power of the nation's ""productivity miracle"". Figures released on Tuesday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy continues to produce more with less. The US labour department on Tuesday said output per work-hour, outside of agriculture, rose at its fastest pace in nearly two decades through the first quarter. Higher productivity growth blunts the effect of rising costs on prices. The first-quarter productivity surge led to the biggest drop in labour costs per unit of output in 18 years. However, the persistence of the slump in investment in labour-saving technologies and the pickup in government spending have raised doubts about how long the spurt in productivity will last. Inflation jitters have intensified over the past month. One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (TIPS), has widened to a two-year high. "
452,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed dispenses medicine to a still-sick economy.,"The Federal Reserve said inflation remained under control and signalled that short-term interest rates would stay at 40-year lows to help an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the colossal investment bust of the past two years. What the US central bank did not say was that economic data have been increasingly mixed and financial news dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq stock index, barometer of what is left of the ""new economy"", has over the past month sunk to levels not seen since the wake of the September 11 terror attacks. America's economic recovery is, once again, in serious doubt, with inflation brewing as a potential problem over the coming year. The Fed's worst nightmare remains the prospect of a race between inflation and recovery - the possibility it will be forced into a Hobbesian decision to tighten the noose on money and credit to suppress inflation before clear signs emerge of a genuine recovery. That dilemma would leave its chairman Alan Greenspan - widely thought to be on his way towards a triumphant retirement - with an important, final challenge: navigating between the dual threats of renewed economic weakness and inflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) decided on Tuesday to leave short-term interest rates at a low of 1.75 per cent, where they have been since November. The general consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"" - in other words, adrenalin for a still-sick economy. The big question is how long it can remain so before risking an inflation problem. Mr Greenspan recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations the Fed will end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could wreck this timetable. To the Fed's relief, inflation appears under control despite last year's dramatic monetary easing. According to the consumer price index, the 12-month trailing rate of inflation has slowed sharply in the past year from 3.5 per cent to just above 1 per cent. The implicit GDP deflator and deflator on personal consumption expenditures - considered better measures by Mr Greenspan - suggest inflation has slid below 1 per cent. While some prices - mainly for oil, gasoline and services such as housing, medical care and education - have surged and prices overall have stabilised, inflation appears generally subdued. However, economic indicators are backward-looking. The issue for the Fed is where inflation is heading from here and where markets expect it to go. A key determinant is the nation's productivity miracle. Figures released Tuesday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy keeps producing more with less. But the persistence of the slump in stock prices and in investment in labour-saving technologies, and the pick-up in government spending, have raised doubts about how long the productivity surge will last. Mr Greenspan said last month he did not expect high figures indefinitely: ""The world just doesn't work that well."" One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (Tips), has grown to a two-year high. Gold dollar prices have jumped and the dollar itself has slid recently - possible preliminary signs of weakening foreign demand for, and an inflationary oversupply of, US currency. Two prominent economic watchdogs have sent warnings. In its latest quarterly industry survey, the National Association of Business Economics, the largest group of corporate economists, said inflation pressures ""were developing"", evinced by ""widely reported"" price increases in services and raw materials. The Institute for Supply Management said purchasing managers were reporting strong growth in costs, with service-sector executives reporting that their costs ""had increased at the fastest rate in 11 months"". A sign of the emerging confusion and policy tensions was an extraordinarily public confrontation last month between a current and a former member of the FOMC at the April 25 annual economic conference of the Levy Economic Institute. Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, said that amid the unusual uncertainty, Fed policy action ""should be modest and infrequent"" to ""avoid destabilising the economy"". That prompted a stern warning from Laurence Meyer, an economist and former FOMC member, about the danger of being ""reactive"" and complacent on inflation - a possible omen of future divisions that are likely to widen if the ""productivity miracle"" falters and the economy does not recover quickly. "
453,2002-06-26,2002-06-27,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Anxious Fed keeps rates at 40-year lows.,"Beset by economic uncertainty and financial turmoil, the US Federal Reserve decided yesterday for the fourth time this year to keep short-term interest rates pegged at 40-year lows. Futures markets, meanwhile, explicitly priced in a slight possibility of Fed rate cuts. That speculation gained a boost from mounting evidence that the US central bank is focusing on the risk of Japan-style deflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to keep its target for the fed funds rate - which regulates overnight lending between banks - at 1.75 per cent. Officials have consistently voiced mild optimism about a moderate recovery, but have avoided returning short-term rates to pre-recession levels, thinking the US still needs easy credit to recover from last year's downturn. The recovery is clearly reflected in economic data. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for non-military capital goods rose in May at the fastest pace since December 2001 and sales of new homes surged to a record. But the surprisingly good news only moderated growing investor distrust of corporate America and anxiety about threats to the recovery posed by the decline of stock prices, faltering consumer sentiment and still-depressed levels of business confidence, profits, capital spending and hiring. Signalling its concern, the US central bank said, in a prepared statement, that the risks facing the Fed remained ""equally balanced"" between economic weakness and higher inflation, the shift towards stockpile building and growth in demand for goods and services ""appear to have moderated"", leaving the course of future strengthening ""uncertain"". A shift in expectations, under way since March, got more support from growing evidence of the Fed's focus on the risk of deflation, as short-term interest rates and measured inflation in the US linger near zero. Last week the US central bank published a study* of how Japan might have avoided its decade-long struggle with deflation. It involved discussion of ""unconventional"" measures in case interest rate cuts failed to arrest a recession. The discussion appeared to reflect concerns the US could have faced - and might face in the future - a dilemma in which interest rates were so low as to be rendered ineffective as a monetary policy tool. The latest study insists ""that when inflation and interest rates have fallen close to zero, and the risk of deflation is high, stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, should go beyond (convention)."" *Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan's Experience in the 1990s (Federal Reserve working paper, June 2002) London Edition 3.

454,2002-06-26,2002-06-27,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Safe-haven buyers boost prices.,"Investors piled into the safe haven of government bonds yesterday after news of WorldCom's fraudulent accounting practices sent equities sharply lower. The Federal Reserve, as expected, left the Federal funds rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent and kept a ""neutral bias"", saying the risks were still balanced between inflation and economic growth. However, expectations have begun to mount that the Fed may cut interest rates further to prop up stock markets and the US economy. Lehman yesterday said it expected the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the third quarter. ""There's a loss of faith in corporate America,"" said Gary Pollack, director of fixed income at Deutsche Bank Private Banking, adding that investors had now become even more worried about the prospect of a ""double-dip"" recession. The Fed did not, as had been hoped by some, yesterday address the market implications arising from WorldCom's accounting fraud. The 10-year note was up 1 point to 101 13/32 to yield 4.689 per cent after the FOMC meeting. The 30-year bond had gained 1 1/32 to 99 to yield 5.387 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/4 to 101 1/32, yielding 2.695 per cent. In the eurozone, bond prices rose in line with those of US Treasuries. The yield on the two-year German schatz bond fell 8.2 basis points to 3.935 per cent. The 10-year German bund yield fell 6.6 basis point to 4.905 per cent. The 10-year September bund future rose 0.52 to 107.79. Bond prices were also supported by the strength of the euro against the dollar but most investors in Europe were focused on the Fed's decision about interest rates. In emerging markets Brazilian bond prices fell further as risk appetite was hit by the WorldCom scandal. Japanese government bond futures prices rose yesterday, after the steepest fall in the Nikkei 225 Average since last September and another major accounting scandal rocked Wall Street. The buying came as the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to halt a resurgent yen for the second time this week. The technology-sensitive Nikkei 225 Average lost 4 per cent to 10,074.56, while the broader-based Topix index closed below the 1,000 support level for the first time in four months. JGBs provided a safe haven for investors, who were also fleeing export shares hit by a yen that rose to its highest level against the dollar in eight months, in the wake of WorldCom's discovery of $3.8bn in accounting irregularities that inflated the group's profits. Analysts said that if the yen continued to gain against the dollar overnight, the bearish equities sentiment could continue, pushing nervous investors towards more purchases of government bonds. The key September 10-year JGB future contract rose 0.09 to 139.16. The benchmark No 240 10-year cash JGB rose 0.087 to 99.912, pushing the yield down 0.010 to 1.310 per cent. London Edition 1. "
455,2002-06-26,2002-06-27,Financial Times,COMMENT &ANALYSIS - A calm Fed watches the correction.,"COMMENT &ANALYSIS - A calm Fed watches the correction - Gerard Baker on why the central bank does not see pressing reasons in US economic conditions to raise or lower. As the world's investors took cover yesterday from the latest accounting bombshell to hit Wall Street, Federal Reserve policymakers put on a familiar display of phlegmatic order amid the turmoil. The US central bank, as expected, prosaically left its main monetary policy instrument, its target for the federal funds rate, unchanged for the fourth straight meeting of its policymaking open market committee (FOMC). But with US equity markets plunging through the low point they reached in the weeks after September 11, it must have been a troubling thought for policymakers that the combination of Kenneth Lay and Bernie Ebbers had done more damage to Americans' wealth than Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta. Last autumn, the Fed cut interest rates aggressively to shield the economy from terrorist-related blows to confidence. So far, and with not much further room for cuts, it has sat tight as markets have steadily crumbled in the past four months. Fed officials are concerned about equity weakness - and indeed about the steep slide in the dollar that has accompanied it. But, going into this week's FOMC meeting, policymakers remained cautiously optimistic that recovery would not be derailed. The biggest source of comfort is that, despite the big declines in equity values so far this year, the real economy continues to show encouraging signs of life. Overall, output growth in the second quarter of the year, which ends this weekend, will be a little more disappointing than looked likely two months ago but should still be in the range of 2.5 per cent at an annual rate. That is well below the inventory-adjustment-driven 5.6 per cent pace of the first quarter but still consistent with steady recovery. Especially encouraging has been the manufacturing sector, which is several months into a recovery from a two-year slide. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders rose by 0.6 per cent in May, the fifth increase in the past six months. Signs of strength in the capital goods markets are what the Fed has been hoping to see, since they should signal the start of a gradual revival in business investment - the collapse of which was the main factor that drove the economy into recession last year. And for all the concern in markets about the dollar's decline, Fed economists like to point out that the stimulative effect on exports will at least counterbalance the deflationary impact on US financial assets. Consumers hold the key. Fed policymakers have looked with awe on American consumers' resilience in the past few years. But they also know that part of Americans' capacity to keep spending has been provided by the Fed itself. In late 1998, when markets swooned after the Russian debt default and Asian financial crisis, and again after the September 11 attacks last year, Alan Greenspan and colleagues moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates. This time, with the Fed running out of ammunition, falling stock prices could be more problematic for consumer spending. Consumers remain stretched, with heavy debt burdens and historically low savings rates. And this week the Conference Board, an independent research group, reported that June had seen the steepest fall in consumer confidence since last autumn, as Americans seemed to take fright at the events on Wall Street. Yet consumers may receive a shot of adrenaline from the same forces that have been sending stocks lower. As equities have declined in the past few months, bond prices have shot higher, sending interest rates lower. As a result, the housing market - where big gains have, for most Americans, more than offset the impact of falling stock prices - remains as strong as ever. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in May rose by 8.1 per cent from a month earlier. Consumers seem to be in the early stages of another round of mortgage refinancing, which should put hundreds of billions of dollars back into their pockets. This may represent a belated adjustment in longer-term interest rates to the Fed's aggressive easing of last year. Or it may simply show that the market is once again ahead of the central bank in rebalancing financial conditions in the economy. The critical factor is that, as long as inflation stays low, the stimulus from lower interest rates need not be reversed any time soon. That is again the source of cautious Fed optimism. In spite of increases in energy prices this year, consumer prices remain flat - indeed some measures of inflation are showing the lowest rate of price increases in more than 40 years. Though the dollar's decline will push up import prices and some domestic prices, the US is still a relatively closed economy and is not likely to see a generalised and sustained increase in prices as a result of events on currency markets. Against that backdrop the Fed is under little pressure to raise interest rates. This same low inflation is, Fed officials believe, part of the reason for the weakness in equity markets. Policymakers do not appear to share some of the more alarmist views of inter-national investors that the accounting issues at World-Com and elsewhere mean US corporate reports are fundamentally untrustworthy, although clearly there are many significant problems. And it is hard to attribute the entire decline in US equity prices in the past six months, or even the bulk of it, to the corporate governance issue. A large part of it may be the result of the weakness of nominal demand in the economy. Inflation is low or even negative, so the relatively small increases in real demand of the past six months are reflected in very small gains in nominal demand - and in corporate sales and profits. Put another way, companies face a situation, unprecedented in the recent past, in which they have virtually no pricing power, even as real demand starts to recover. Of course, further steep falls in equity prices would complicate the Fed's task, especially if accompanied by a dive in the dollar. But for the moment, a benign inflationary environment and declines in market interest rates are keeping alive hopes at the central bank that a navigable path can be found through the unravelling of 1990s excess.

457,2001-06-27,2001-06-28,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed harboured private worries about US inflation.,"The Federal Reserve fretted over ""rising"" inflation risks during its interest rate-setting meeting in May, even while appearing to dismiss them publicly. Minutes of the May 15 meeting of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee, released on Thursday, say members believed the slowdown ""would hold down inflation"" but ""nonetheless, there were some risks of rising inflation"". At that meeting, one member, Thomas Hoenig, refused to vote with the majority decision to cut rates a half-point, urging a more modest quarter-point cut. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, strives to achieve consensus and is largely successful. Dissent on the FOMC is rare. The minutes raise the likelihood that Mr Greenspan faced disagreement at this week's FOMC meeting. It means Wednesday's decision to cut rates by a quarter-point might have marked the beginning of the end (if not the end) of the Fed's most dramatic monetary easing in at least 14 years. The May minutes show concern that - with US labour markets ""still tight by historical standards"" and falling productivity failing to suppress unit labour costs - an economic recovery might ""put added upward pressure on prices"". This echoes concerns expressed recently by Fed officials Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer, concerns appearing to contradict Mr Greenspan. He has repeatedly played down inflation risks this year, suggesting the Fed, as a body, was not worried about it. In a recent speech in Singapore, he said ""inflation is not a significant problem"", but added, ""at the moment"". In later comments to the Senate Banking Committee, he said: ""We have to be very careful about any evidence of emerging inflationary instability."" To some, tensions were evident in the brevity of the FOMC's statement on Wednesday announcing its latest move.""It was very general, short and less forward-looking, suggesting serious disagreement on the outlook and risks,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""When you do have considerable disagreement, it's easier to agree on fewer words."" The Fed may have less reason to worry. Gauges of inflation expectations, such as the gold price and one of the Fed's internal measures of market inflation expectations (the difference between yields on Treasury bonds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, adjusting for differences in duration and liquidity) surged to 12-month highs in May. But both have fallen in the past month. The Treasuries market appeared to have a strong reaction to the FOMC minutes acknowledging inflation risks. The yield for the inflation-sensitive 10-year bond yield was up 5 basis points and ended the session up 10 basis points. "
458,2001-06-27,2001-06-28,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed cuts rates in bid to head off recession.,"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, extending its six-month campaign to head off the threat of recession to a US economy it has called 'unacceptably weak'. The central bank's policymaking open market committee voted to cut its target for the federal funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent, its lowest level since April 1994. It also cut by a 1/4 point its largely symbolic discount rate, to 3.25 per cent. Hopes for a half-point cut had been weakened by recent positive economic data but it still extended what many consider to be the central bank's most aggressive easing of money and credit in 14 years. The Fed has now reduced its interest rate target by 23/4 percentage points in six months to revive an economy it has called ""unacceptably weak"". Explaining its latest move, the Fed said weakness in profits and investment, slowing growth overseas and emerging weakness in consumer spending were weighing on the economy. It asserted, as it has all year, that long-term economic trends remained favourable. But for now, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"", it said, affirming the possibility of more rate cuts. But - unlike in recent statements - the Fed left out specific language that had signalled rate cuts between scheduled meetings in the past. The FOMC meets again on August 21. Economists are hopeful that the Fed's campaign, which began in January, will eventually have a big impact after the typical six-to-eight month lag. There are also high hopes for added stimulus from recent federal income tax cuts. But Fed officials have privately expressed concern that their work had been undermined by a strong dollar, which has hurt US exports, the recent upward drift in long-term interest rates and weak equity prices. Some investment strategists contend weak corporate profits and profit forecasts - which continue to tumble, threatening, the US with another round of cuts in production, investment and employment - may overwhelm the Fed's efforts. Some economists also fear heavy and rising debt levels among US consumers endanger the continued growth in consumer spending. Another potential worry for the Fed remains the risk that its actions will fuel imbalances that undermine the economy's long-term health. Several top Fed officials - including Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer - have wondered aloud about the possibility of an inflation surge. These concerns may have provoked dissent within the FOMC, possibly playing a role in its decision to reduce rates a quarter-, instead of a half-, point. The Fed might have one less thing to worry about: Several market measures of inflation concerns have subsided. The Fed's internal measure of market inflation expectations - the gap between yields on Treasury bonds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds - has dropped to its lowest level since early April after jumping to 12-month highs in May.

The decision means the Fed has reduced its interest rate target by 23/4 percentage points in six months to jump-start an economy it has described as ""unacceptably weak"". Some expectations of a half-point cut had been undermined by recent positive economic data but Wednesday's action is still widely seen as the central bank's most aggressive easing of money and credit in 14 years. The central bank's policy-making open market committee voted to cut its target for the federal funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent, its lowest since April 1994. The Fed also cut by a quarter-point its largely symbolic discount rate to 3.25 per cent. In a statement accompanying the move, the Fed said declining company profitability and capital spending, weak expansion of consumption, and slowing growth abroad continued to weigh on the economy. It pointed to continuing favourable trends helping long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy. But, despite these, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"". The Fed also said easing pressures in the labour and product markets were expected to keep inflation contained. But, unlike recent statements, the Fed left out language indicating readiness to make a further rate cut before the next scheduled meeting of the committee on August 21. Economists are hopeful the Fed's latest rate-cut campaign, which began in January, will have a significant economic impact after a typical six to eight month lag. Many also have high hopes for added stimulus from recent federal income tax cuts. A potential worry for the Fed remains the risk that its actions have fuelled - or will fuel - imbalances that undermine the economy's long-term health. Several top Fed officials - including Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer-have wondered aloud about the possibility of an inflation surge. It is possible that these concerns led to dissent within the FOMC and played a role in its decision to cut rates by a quarter-point rather than the half-point widely expected. Fed officials have privately expressed concern that their efforts have been undermined by a strong dollar, which has hurt US exports, the recent upward drift in long-term market interest rates and the weakness of equity prices.

Volume of 25,000 in the March 2001 contract was 50 per cent up from Monday's dismal performance and the trading range on the contract doubled to 140 points. March touched a low of 6,226 at one stage but the pressure from a strong rise by US equities on Monday and further buying yesterday ahead of the FOMC meeting on rates pushed it to a high of 6,367. The future ended the day close to its peak and more than 60 points above the cash market. At that level it was at a 20-point premium to the estimated fair value. In options, however, volumes remained muted with only 34,000 lots dealt compared with 33,486 on Monday. Activity was evenly spread between calls and puts while only two stocks - Vodafone and BT - traded more than 1,000 lots. Vodafone, which has a January expiry, traded 5,753 with most of the business seen in the January 240p puts and January 260p and 280p calls. "
461,2000-12-19,2000-12-20,Financial Times,FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Fed hints rate cut may be on the way.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday left short-term interest rates unchanged but declared itself more worried about the risk of recession than of inflation. Amid mounting fears of recession, the Fed's policy-making open market committee signalled a likely end to an 18-month cycle of interest rate increases by suggesting its next move was more likely to be a reduction. It is the first time in at least two years that the committee has been signalling the ""tilt"" in its assessment of the economy that it has skipped a stage. It has moved from leaning towards tightening to leaning towards easing, passing over a neutral stance. In a possible hint it might make a rate cut decision before the next scheduled meeting late in January, it said it would continue to monitor the economy closely. A Fed statement explaining its decision to keep its target rate for Federal funds unchanged at 6.5 per cent said some inflation risks persisted but were reduced by the more moderate pace of economic activity and moderate expectations of inflation. That marks a significant change from the mid-November statement, when the FOMC said labour shortages and high energy prices harboured the ""possibility of raising inflation expectations"" and hence inflation and added that the economic slowdown had ""not been sufficient to warrant a change"" in its anti-inflation posture. The tightening in credit conditions and the drop in equity prices in the past months now threaten the boom in business investment, a hallmark of the nine-year expansion.

463,1990-10-02,1990-10-03,Financial Times,Foreign Exchanges: Dollar held in narrow range,"CURRENCIES TRADED in narrow ranges yesterday, lacking fresh factors. The dollar held comfortably above technical support levels of DM1.5520 against the D-Mark and Y136.60 in terms of the yen, while showing no sign of attacking resistance at DM1.5650 and Y137.50. The Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, amid speculation about an easing of monetary policy if agreement to cut the US budget deficit is ratified by Congress. Minutes of the meeting will not be released until next month, but dealers will be looking for monetary signals from the Fed's money market management. Funds were added to the New York banking system yesterday via overnight system repurchases. This was more aggressive than expected, but analysts doubted whether it was more than a technical move to bring Federal funds down from 8 3/16 per cent. Shortly after the action Fed funds fell to 8 1/8 per cent, nearer to the assumed target rate of 8 per cent. Expectations of lower interest rates pushed the dollar down sharply on Monday, but steadier trading yesterday reflected hopes that a cut in the budget deficit would also indicate determination by the US to improve its overall economic performance. At the London close the dollar was unchanged Y136.90, but had advanced to DM1.5550 from DM1.5515; to SFr1.2920 from SFr1.2890; and to FFr5.2100 from FFr5.2000. Its index rose to 62.5 from 62.4. Sterling was little changed overall, recovering from a slight dip caused by a bigger than forecast fall of Dollars 344m in September UK official reserves. The market expected a drop of about Dollars 80m, but the figure appeared to suggest that Bank of England support for the pound had been larger than previously believed when the currency was defended on September 21. After a brief decline on the news, the pound rallied in fairly thin trading. It finished 10 points lower against the dollar at Dollars 1.8885 and eased to Y258.50 from Y258.75, but improved to DM2.9375 from DM2.9325; to SFr2.4400 from SFr2.4350; and to FFr9.8400 from FFr9.8250. Sterling's index was generally steady, closing unchanged at 93.5. A sharp rise in Japanese share prices failed to have much impact on the yen. Dealers said they were surprised at the lack of reaction, but the currency did improve slightly against most European currencies. The D-Mark fell to Y88.05 from Y88.25. Trading among members of the European Monetary System was subdued. High interest rates kept the Spanish peseta at the top of the exchange rate mechanism and interest rate factors also supported the French franc. The Italian lira steadied after its recent fall, helped by firmer money market rates after Monday's action by the Bank of Italy to drain liquidity. "
464,1990-03-27,1990-03-28,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Dow moves up sharply on programme buying,"AFTER TRADING in a tight range for most of yesterday's session, programme buying pushed leading US stock indices sharply higher in the last hour of business, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 29.28 points higher at 2,736.94 following Monday's tiny gain of 3.38 points. With no dramatics overnight on Japanese markets and with the first quarter coming to an end, nobody had expected any large fluctuations and, despite the size of yesterday's rally, it came in thin volume of only 131m shares. The dominance of futures-related arbitrage as stock index futures rose to large premiums over their underlying cash stocks - so prompting selling of the futures and buying of cash stocks - makes it difficult to tell how much actual demand there was. The background to yesterday's session did not look auspicious. On Monday, the Dow had jumped 20 points in reaction to the second largest rally ever in Tokyo only to fall back to close with a very modest gain in the second slowest day of trading since the start of the year. The inability to draw much sustenance from more stable conditions in Japan reflected some concerns about the next round of quarterly earnings results as well as the fact that any end-quarter buying by institutional portfolio managers has probably now been completed. There is a dearth of economic news this week which is also keeping trading volume low. The only economic figures of any note are today's revisions for fourth quarter GNP which are not likely to inspire much interest. The financial markets are much more concerned about the performance of the economy this month, given that the outlook for monetary policy appears to be finely balanced. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets a target for the Federal Funds rate, started its regular meeting yesterday to review its monetary stance. There appears to be consensus that the Fed will leave monetary policy unchanged until it has seen the economic evidence for March. Trading was dull in the Treasury bond market. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bond was quoted 1/8 point lower for a yield of 8.47 per cent. Among featured stocks yesterday was American Express which dropped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 . The company said yesterday that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to purchase Shearson Lehman Hutton. JP Industries gained Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 . T&N of Britain identified itself as the bidder for the company, which said that it had agreed in principle to be acquired for Dollars 17.30 a share. Bally Manufacturing added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 on a US press report that Mr Arthur Goldberg, the investor, had bought about Dollars 13m worth of shares, or 4.5 per cent. Canada TORONTO closed mixed in light trading. The composite index closed up 11.00 at 3,678.46 but declines edged advances 297 to 289. Volume was just 20.2m shares, down from just under 23m. Golds closed up 1.28 per cent after losing more than 6 per cent, as the price of gold rebounded somewhat from Monday's sharp fall. "
465,2005-12-13,2005-12-14,Financial Times,End to rate rise cycle signalled *Fed committee in quarter-point increase *Policy no longer 'accommodative' *Options freed up for Greenspan...,"The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a final phase in its monetary tightening campaign, as it stopped describing policy as stimulating the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 4.25 per cent, the 13th consecutive increase since June of last year. But the committee removed from its statement the language used on each previous occasion which had said that ""policy accommodation"" would continue to be removed at a ""measured"" pace. The new statement suggested that the committee would continue tightening policy, even though the federal funds rate may no longer be accommodative - a reference to the notion of a neutral rate at which policy neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has suggested the notion of interest rate neutrality is too vague and too difficult to measure to provide a precise guide for policymakers. The Fed's looser formulation on the future path of rate increases suggested uncertainty among policymakers about how much further rates will have to rise and hinted that the central bank is close to the end of its tightening cycle. The statement said: ""The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives."" The new forward-looking language suggested interest rates will rise again in January, at the last meeting chaired by Mr Greenspan - and probably after that - but handed a cleaner slate to Ben Bernanke, who will take over in February and chair his first FOMC meeting in March. Futures markets continued to price in another rate increase in January, bringing the Federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent, and a still good but slightly reduced chance of another rise after that to 4.75 per cent. Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, said: ""It is a gradual step towards a little more flexibility. Inflation, the economy and the markets will dictate how much further they go. They say the economy is strong and that inflation risks are tilted a little to the upside. There is nothing yet in the data that will stop the Fed."" The Fed said economic expansion remained solid in spite of high energy prices and disruptions related to the Gulf coast hurricanes - a more confident note than in November - following a string of encouraging data releases. It said inflation had stayed relatively low and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. But it warned: ""Possible increases in resource utilisation as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" The minutes of the Fed's last meeting and public comments from policymakers have indicated a concern about characterising monetary policy as accommodative now that is no longer obviously the case. Estimates of the neutral rate tend to be centred at about 4.25 per cent. "
466,2005-12-13,2005-12-14,Financial Times,Treasuries make cautious gains GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasuries moved higher after yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee statement signalled its run of 13 consecutive rate rises could be nearing its end. But the Fed still raised rates by a quarter point, as expected, to 4.25 per cent, and said ""further measured policy firming"" was likely to be needed to counter inflationary pressures. The FOMC changed the two most market-sensitive parts of its statement.The reference to existingpolicy ""accommodation"" was removed, suggesting rates may not go much higher. Meanwhile, the reference to ""measured"" future rate rises was retained, but in a changed context. ""The FOMC indicated another rate hike is likelyon January 31, but left the door open for March 28,"" said analysts at Action Economics. ""If inflation pressures remain contained in early 2006, as we suspect, the Fed may be able to moveto the sidelines in March."" Although anticipated by many, the shift in outlook indicated by the Fed's new language sent Treasuries higher. Shortly after the release of the FOMC statement yesterday afternoon in New York, yields on two-year notes were down 2.1 basis points at 4.417 per cent. Ten-year yields were down 2.6bp at 4.527 per cent. Shorter-dated eurozone government bonds slipped as investors bet that the European Central Bank would raise interest rates again after a German investor survey showed confidence in the eurozone's largest economy was at a 21-month high. The yield on the two-year Schatz was up just less than 1bp at 2.776 per cent. However, the longer-dated, less rate-sensitive 10-year Bund saw yields slip 3bp to3.389 per cent. In the UK, gilts firmed after consumer price inflation fell to its lowest level in five months, renewing hopes of a rate cut from the bank of England in the new year. The yield on the two-year dropped 3.5bp to 4.358 and the 10-year was down almost 1bp at 4.248 per cent. Japanese government bonds rose after strong demand for an auction of20-year paper counteredthe impact of overnightrises in US Treasury yields, which briefly pushed the10-year JGB yield up to1.6 per cent. Bids for the Y700bn auction totalled 3.02 times the amount on offer. Yields on benchmark 10-year paper slipped after the sale, ending down 2bp at 1.575 per cent. "
467,2005-12-13,2005-12-14,Financial Times,Fed signals end of rate tightening era.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled the final stage in its rate tightening campaign, as it stopped describing monetary policy as accommodative but highlighted inflation risks. The Federal Open Market Committee raised the Federal funds rate another quarter point, its 13th consecutive move, bringing the target rate to 4.25 per cent. But it deleted the language - used repeatedly since June of last year, when the Fed funds rate was at 1 per cent - that ""policy accommodation"" would continue to be removed at a rate ""that was likely to be measured"". The statement made explicit the Fed's intention of slowing growth in the economy to contain inflation pressures. But it gave a looser formulation on the future of interest rate increases, suggesting uncertainty among policymakers about how much further rates would rise, suggesting the central bank was close to the end of the tightening cycle. ""The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance,"" it says. ""The committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives."" The new formulation suggested the committee would raise rates again in January, at the last meeting chaired by Alan Greenspan, and probably after that - but also handed a cleaner slate to his successor, Ben Bernanke, who will take over in February and chair his firstmeeting in March.

468,2005-12-13,2005-12-14,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Biggest one-day Yen rally for five years.,"The yen rallied sharply, chalking up its biggest one-day rise against the dollar since March 2000 as speculators scrambled to close short-yen positions. The move was sparked by a barrage of dollar-negative news, from a softer monetary policy statement to yet another record US trade deficit, which prompted traders to cash in their lucrative long-dollar positions The yen jumped to Y116.84 against the dollar, 2.7 per cent stronger than its level immediately prior to Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement, as well as leaping 2 per cent to Y140.56 against the euro, 2.5 per cent to Y88.33 against the Australian dollar, 2.9 per cent to Y101.27 to the Canadian dollar and 2.4 per cent to Y207.12 versus sterling. The rally came in spite of poor conditions reported by the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese business, although it was ""consistent with GDP growth of over 3 per cent by the end of this year"", said Keith Gyles at Capital Economics. The prevailing view was that the yen, which had tumbled 10.4 per cent against the dollar since early September, was benefiting from a liquidation of the swarm of short-yen positions that had built up in the market. ""There are short-yen positions against a whole range of currencies as it has been used as a funding currency,"" said Tony Norfield, global head of forex strategy at ABN Amro. ""At the end of the year, people are closing down their book and this could led to a much bigger snapback in the yen."" Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York, also saw hedge funds and speculators locking-in profits from their short-yen trades to guarantee their year-end bonuses. However, few thought that the move was the start of a trend recovery for the yen. Chris Towner, consultant at risk manager HIFX, said technical factors pointed to a target of Y115 in dollar/yen. He saw the catalyst for the move as profit-taking by foreign investors in Japanese equities, which forced them to buy back the yen they had sold to hedge their currency exposure. Others saw the initial driver for the correction as Wednesday's Fed statement. As expected, the Fed raised rates to 4.25 per cent, its 13th straight hike. However, it softened the language of the accompanying statement to suggest that rates were now reaching neutral levels, although ""some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed"". Steven Saywell, chief currencies strategist at Citigroup, said ""cyclical support for the dollar has peaked"", and while most analysts still expect the FOMC to raise rates again in January (and probably March), this opinion is no longer universal. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, pencilled in a 40 per cent chance of a January pause. The news worsened yesterday as the October US trade deficit ballooned to a record of $68.9bn, confounding forecasts for a narrowing of September's $66.1bn gap. Capital Economics raised the possibility that fourth-quarter US GDP growth could actually turn negative as a result. The burgeoning deficit may have held little power over the dollar this year, but James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said: ""There is a risk that concerns about imbalances could start to exert greater influence on the dollar now that the Fed appears closer to the peak in rates."" Mr Woolfolk saw capital inflows into the US continuing to fund the current account deficit for now, but added: ""The risk of a dislocation upsetting this balance is growing larger with time. If and when the wheels come flying off, the dollar will have quite a way to fall."" The dollar fell 0.8 per cent to a six-week low of $1.2038 against the euro but was little changed at $1.7739 to sterling, which was unsettled by soft UK labour market data; unemployment rose for a 10th straight month and earnings growth weakened. "
469,2005-12-13,2005-12-14,Financial Times (FT.Com),"FT.com site : Yen rallies, dollar falls after Fed statement.","The under-fire yen surged higher in European morning trade on Wednesday, becoming the main beneficiary of a dollar sell-off in the wake of Wednesday's Federal Reserve statement. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates for the 13th straight meeting, taking short-term rates to 4.25 per cent. However the FOMC also softened the language of the accompanying statement to suggest that rates were now reaching neutral levels. The regular mantra that ""policy accommodation"" would continue to be removed at a ""measured"" pace was missing from the statement, although the committee did say that ""some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed"". Some softening of language had been expected, but the overall statement was probably more dovish than many had expected, with Treasury yields trending lower. And while most analysts still expect the FOMC to raise rates once again in January, this opinion is no longer universal. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, said the Fed had opened the door for a January pause. ""We deem a 60 per cent chance for a January 25-basis point rate hike to 4.5 per cent, which is to be followed by a rate cut in Q4, bringing down the Fed funds rate back to 4.25 per cent by end of 2006,"" said Mr Laidi. Against this backdrop the dollar fell to $1.2026 against the euro, 1c weaker than its level immediately prior to the statement, 0.7c to C$1.1445 against the Canadian dollar, a 14-year low, and Y1.6 to Y118.53 against the yen. The yen was the major beneficiary, jumping Y0.6 to Y142.49 against the euro, Y0.95 to Y89.60 against the Australian dollar and Y2.2 to Y209.96 versus sterling, despite the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese business conditions coming in below forecasts. The reading for large manufacturers came in at +21, better than the +19 recorded in the third quarter but below forecasts for a rise to +23. However the large non-manufacturers index did rise to its highest level since 1992, and the overall report was ""consistent with GDP growth of over 3 per cent by the end of this year,"" in the words of Keith Gyles, economist at Capital Economics. News that Tokyo department store sales growth jumped to 4.3 per cent year-on-year in November, from 1.5 per cent in October, was a clear yen plus. However the general view was that the yen's sharp rally may have been largely fuelled by speculators cutting long dollar/yen positions in the wake of the FOMC statement. ""Speculative positioning data has for some time indicated significant short-yen positions and these positions are now being pared,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. In contrast sterling was weaker, sitting little changed at $1.7717 against the dollar and falling 0.7p to GBP0.6784 against the euro. The pound was unsettled by soft UK labour market data, with unemployment rising for a tenth straight month and headline earnings growth falling to 3.6 per cent year-on-on-year in October, from 4.1 per cent in September. The data helped strengthen talk of a further UK rate cut, with ING Financial Markets looking for 50 basis points of cuts in the first half of 2006. "
470,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times,Dissenting vote on rate rise fails to ruffle Fed analysts.,"Fed-watchers yesterday played down the importance of a dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, as the US central bank indicated that it has more work to do in raising interest rates. The FOMC raised interest rates, as expected, and acknowledged the increased uncertainty in the economic outlook following Hurricane Katrina. But there was no hint of a pause to come, as the committee said that following yesterday's increase policy remained accommodative and that it expected to continue raising rates at a measured pace. Mark Olson, a Fed governor better known as a banking expert than as an economist, went against Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, voting to leave interest rates on hold. And only seven of the 12 regional Fed branches asked for an increase in the Fed's discount rate, a largely symbolic gesture, though one that has been made with only rare exception as the Fed had increased rates consecutively at the last 10 meetings before yesterday. ""The dissent by Olson is probably not evidence of a split and some of the regional banks might have found it hard to ask for an increase right after the hurricane but I assume they will quickly fall into line behind the next one,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. ""They gave no hint of a pause although of course they could do that in the future."" Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, referring to Mr Olson's dissent and the regional Fed requests, said: ""We do not believe these actions are significant and continue to expect the Fed to raise rates at a measured 25 basis points per meeting through the January meeting, bringing the Fed funds target rate to 4.5 per cent."" If anything, the FOMC statement was a little more hawkish than expected. The committee acknowledged the disruption following Katrina and the potential for energy price volatility. The committee said that while Katrina had increased uncertainty about ""near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat"". By raising rates another quarter point to 3.75 per cent, signalling more to come and focusing on inflation risks than growth risks, the FOMC left little doubt about its greatest concern. In a slight tweak in its language, rather than saying inflation expectations were ""well contained"" it merely said they were ""contained"". Last week's Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed the expected drop - following Katrina - but also showed a rise in inflation expectations. ""The statement represents a real skilful exercise in risk management by the Fed. They acknowledged the increased uncertainty but in their view the risk of higher inflation outweighs the risk to growth,"" Mr Berner said. The last time a Fed governor dissented was in September 2002, when the FOMC left rates on hold, but a former governor, Edward Gramlich favoured easing monetary policy. "
471,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times,Greenback consolidates gains CURRENCIES.,"The US dollar edged higher yesterday as the Federal Reserve, as expected, raised interest rates by 25 basis points for the eleventhsuccessive meeting. Shortly after the decision the greenback was trading at Dollars 1.2130 against the euro, from Dollars 1.2163 prior to the decision, as well as firming up by a similar margin to Dollars 1.8000 against sterling, Y111.89 versus the yen and SFr1.2808 against the Swiss franc. The dollar index strengthened to 88.59, from 88.32 before the announcement. Although a minority of economists had expected the Fed to pause its rate-hiking cycle in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the decision to push rates to 3.75 per cent had largely been priced in to the currency market. The accompanying statement was on the hawkish side with the Federal Open Market Committee saying monetary policy was still ""accommodative"", that rates could be raised at a ""measured pace"" and that Katrina would only set back the US economy in the ""near term"". The FOMC warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher, rather than fretting about the potential hit to economic growth. ""Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures,'' the FOMC said. However, dollar bears were able to take comfort from the fact that, unusually, the FOMC's decision was not unanimous, with one committee member, Mark Olson, dissenting from the 9-1 majority vote. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has already commented on ""froth"" in the US housing market and there was little indication of any slowdown in figures released yesterday showing US housing starts remained strong at 2.009m (annualised) in August, a fifth consecutive month above the 2m mark. The recent push in the gold price to a 17-year high is seen as a sign that the market is becoming more concerned about inflation. The widening spread between 10-year Treasury yields and inflation protected TIPS suggests investors are concerned over how successful the Fed will be in fighting inflation with higher interest rates. The Canadian central bank is due to hold its interest rate setting meeting shortly. Comments from its US counterpart on inflation expectations could have some impact on the outlook for Canadian rates. The Canadian dollar moved in a narrow range against the dollar yesterday, trading at CDollars 1.1700 after the loonie reached a 14-year high against the greenback on Monday. ""The Canadian dollar has been one of our most favoured currencies for some time now, given the mix of rising energy costs, strengthening economic momentum, fiscal and current account surpluses and a central bank in the foothills of monetary tightening,"" said Simon Derrick at the Bank of New York. ""Such is the momentum of late, that further progress towards the all-time high (CDollars 1.1198 set in November 1991) now looks a distinct possibility."" In Germany, the ZEW survey of economic sentiment fell more sharply than expected in September with the decline blamed on uncertainty over the general election. Selling pressure on the euro appeared to be easing amid emerging optimism about the possibility of a agreement between the main political parties. Prior to the Federal Reserve decision the euro had been up 0.3 per cent at Dollars 1.2175 from Dollars 1.2134 overnight. Against sterling, the euro strengthened 0.1 per cent to Pounds 0.6749. In the UK, the housing market showed signs of stabilising, according to a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Concerns over the outlook for consumer spending and economic growth meant sterling remained under pressure against the dollar, trading at Dollars 1.8043 prior to the Fed decision, down fractionally on the day. "
472,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times,Bankruptcy hanging over Delphi WALL STREET.,"Wall Street pulled back modestly after the monetary-policy setting committee of the Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates by a quarter point, as expected. The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged the ""widespread devastation"" inflicted upon the southern US by Hurricane Katrina but said ""these unfortunate events . . . do not pose a more persistent threat"" to long-term economic performance. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 10,544.34, the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent to 1,229.05, while the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.2 per cent to 2,150.36. Away from the Fed's decision, a handful of corporate stories provided an impetus for trading. Delphi tumbled 18.3 per cent to an all-time low of Dollars 2.755 but recovered slightly and was down 11.9 per cent at Dollars 2.97. The company is in ongoing discussions with General Motors, its biggest customer, in an attempt to stave off bankruptcy. Circuit City Stores rose 6.6 per cent to Dollars 16.54 after its third quarter profits beat expectations. The performance followed disappointing results last week by Best Buy, a rival. But Estee Lauder, the cosmetics retailer, fell 11 per cent to Dollars 36.03. After the close on Monday, the company cut its sales forecasts for the second half of 2005, blaming the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the southern US, lower-than-expected sales from promotions and the impact of rising energy prices on consumers. JPMorgan downgraded the stock from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"". Coca-Cola Enterprises was 1.8 per cent lower at Dollars 19.10, Pepsi Bottling Group fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 27.23 and PepsiAmericas fell 3.9 per cent to Dollars 23.30 as Lehman Brothers downgraded the trio, citing rising costs due to energy inflation and the likelihood of sluggish volume growth as price rises are raised to cover these costs. Higher energy costs also took their toll on US Steel, which fell 4.2 per cent to Dollars 43.33 in the wake of a profits warning. Alongside a rising energy bill, US Steel also cited lower shipments and prices for its warning on third quarter earnings. Logistics company Swift Transportation fell 7.5 per cent to Dollars 17.04 as it said higher fuel costs and weaker demand for freight would cause it to miss third quarter earnings' expectations. Maytag fell 2.7 per cent to Dollars 18.04 after it said earnings would fall short of expectations this year. The company is the subject of a takeover approach from Whirlpool, a rival appliance group, which fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 74.03. Tempur Pedic International, the mattress maker, plunged 26.7 per cent to Dollars 12.01. The company cut its earnings guidance, citing consumer reluctance to buy big-ticket items. "
473,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Rita brings weakness to dollar.,"Increasing concerns about disruption from Hurricane Rita led to weakness in the dollar yesterday as the greenback failed to sustain the modest gains that followed the rise in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. The latest spike in crude and oil product prices contributed to dollar weakness after the Federal Open Markets Committee warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher. ""The message from the FOMC was clear,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi: ""Increasingly inflationary pressures are a greater concern within the FOMC than the slowdown in economic growth post-Katrina."" Traders said the reaction of the major currencies to the hawkish tone of the FOMC statement had been surprisingly muted. The dollar weakened by 1 per cent against the Swiss Franc to reach a low of SFr1.2684 before recovering slightly to trade at SFr1.2711. In spite of the rise in US rates, the dollar failed to breach the key support level of $1.21 against the euro. This encouraged the single currency to rally to $1.2230. A modest late rally in the dollar brought the euro back to $1.2211. Dealers said once Rita had passed, the dollar could find support from the widening spread between US and eurozone 10-year bond yields, which has reached the highest level since 1999. European bond yields have sunk to an all-time low amid concerns over the outlook for growth which were underlined by the IMF yesterday. The Canadian dollar continued its strong rally, reaching a new 14-year high of C$1.1644 against the dollar before easing to trade at C$1.1690. Sentiment was boosted by better-than-expected retail sales figures, which reinforced the view that gross domestic product was continuing to gain momentum. Support for the currency has also come from a pick-up in foreign demand for Canadian equities as its stock market is heavily weighted with resources companies. In the UK, the minutes of the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee were much as expected, showing the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. ""We still judge the MPC's growth forecasts are too optimistic,"" said Philip Shaw of Investec Securities: ""However, while the committee frets over inflation, it is unlikely to cut rates and we see policy remaining on hold for the remainder of this year."" Sterling traded 0.6 per cent stronger against the dollar at $1.8090 but 0.2 per cent weaker against the euro at GBP0.6747. High oil prices are boosting the Norwegian krone, which is trading at a 30-month high against the euro. The Norwegian central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent but signalled an increase was likely at the next meeting. The krone initially firmed to NKr7.7805 before easing back to trade at NKr7.7951. In Japan, although the Nikkei recently broke through the 13,000 level, stronger economic conditions appear to be translating into higher capital outflows by Japanese investors, offsetting the currency impact from the increase in foreign equity inflows. ""For the yen to gain more decisively, we need to see a more active rotation in favour of the Nikkei by Japanese investors and not just by foreign investors,"" said analysts at UBS. The dollar fell 0.9 per cent against the yen to a low of Y110.98 before recovering to trade at Y111.36. The euro traded 0.2 per cent stronger against the yen at Y135.91. "
474,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar softens as oil prices move higher.,"Having initially strengthened in response to the rise in US interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, the dollar failed to sustain its gains and softened against other major currencies during mid-morning business in Europe. The accompanying statement was on the hawkish side with the Federal Open Market Committee saying monetary policy was still ""accommodative"", that rates could be raised at a ""measured pace"" and that Katrina would only set back the US economy in the ""near term"". ""The message from the FOMC was clear,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi: ""Increasingly inflationary pressures are a greater concern within the FOMC than the slowdown in economic growth post-Katrina."" Against the euro, after failing to break the key support level at $1.2100, the dollar weakened around 0.4 per cent to $1.2230 before rallying to trade at $1.2204. The latest spike in crude and oil product prices in response to the threat from Hurricane Rita was one factor contributing to dollar weakness on Wednesday after the FOMC warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher. Trading against the Swiss Franc followed a similar pattern with the dollar weakening 1 per cent to reach a low of SFr1.2684 before recovering slightly to trade at SFr1.2712. The Candian dollar remains the strongest performer among the major currencies reaching a near 14 year high against the dollar recently. The currency has received support as Canada is a major supplier of natural gas to the US and has benefitted from higher gas prices following the recent hurricane-induced disruptions. Also foreign demand for Canadian equities appears to have picked up as the Canadian market is resource rich, again providing support for the currency. Against the Canadian dollar, the greenback traded at C$1.1672. More generally, traders said the reaction in the major currencies to the hawkish tone of the FOMC statement was surprisingly muted. The euro was continuing to be held back by uncertainty surrounding the political outlook in Germany following the inconclusive general election. The euro traded marginally stronger against the yen at Y135.83 and also against Sterling at GBP0.6749. However, against the Swiss Franc, the euro lost ground trading at SFr1.5518. In the UK, the minutes of the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee were much as expected showing the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The MPC identified two broad areas of risk. Firstly, that weaker demand could result in lower GDP growth which in turn would put downward pressure on inflation. Second there were upside risks to projections for inflation as energy prices could rise further. ""We still judge the MPC's growth forecasts are too optimistic,"" said Philip Shaw of Investec Securities: ""However, while the committee frets over inflation, it is unlikely to cut rates and we see policy remaining on hold for the remainder of this year."" Sterling traded fractionally stronger against the dollar at $1.8079. The Norwegian central bank meets today with a quarter point increase in interest rates to 2.25 per cent expected by some analysts. Norwegian inflation is on the rise but high oil prices are seen as providing a support for the currency. The Norwegian Krone traded slightly weaker against the euro at NKr7.7810 ahead of the announcement. In Japan, although the Nikkei recently broke through the 13,000 level, stronger economic conditions in Japan appear to be translting into higher capital outflows by Japanese investors which are more than offsetting the currency impact from the increase in foreign equity inflows. ""For the Yen to gain more decively, we need to see a more active rotation in favour of the Nikkei by Japanese investors and not just by foreign investors,"" said analysts at UBS. The dollar fell around 0.7 per cent against the yen to a low of Y111.16 before recovering modestly to trade at Y111.27. "
475,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dissenting vote on rate rise fails to ruffle Fed analysts.,"Fed-watchers on Tuesday played down the importance of a dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, as the US central bank indicated that it has more work to do in raising interest rates. The FOMC raised interest rates, as expected, and acknowledged the increased uncertainty in the economic outlook following Hurricane Katrina. But there was no hint of a pause to come, as the committee said that following Tuesday's increase policy remained accommodative and that it expected to continue raising rates at a measured pace. Mark Olson, a Fed governor better known as a banking expert than as an economist, went against Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, voting to leave interest rates on hold. And only seven of the 12 regional Fed branches asked for an increase in the Fed's discount rate, a largely symbolic gesture, though one that has been made with only rare exception as the Fed had increased rates consecutively at the last 10 meetings before yesterday. ""The dissent by Olson is probably not evidence of a split and some of the regional banks might have found it hard to ask for an increase right after the hurricane but I assume they will quickly fall into line behind the next one,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. ""They gave no hint of a pause although of course they could do that in the future."" Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, referring to Mr Olson's dissent and the regional Fed requests, said: ""We do not believe these actions are significant and continue to expect the Fed to raise rates at a measured 25 basis points per meeting through the January meeting, bringing the Fed funds target rate to 4.5 per cent."" If anything, the FOMC statement was a little more hawkish than expected. The committee acknowledged the disruption following Katrina and the potential for energy price volatility. The committee said that while Katrina had increased uncertainty about ""near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat"". By raising rates another quarter point to 3.75 per cent, signalling more to come and focusing on inflation risks than growth risks, the FOMC left little doubt about its greatest concern. In a slight tweak in its language, rather than saying inflation expectations were ""well contained"" it merely said they were ""contained"". Last week's Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed the expected drop following Katrina but also showed a rise in inflation expectations. ""The statement represents a real skilful exercise in risk management by the Fed. They acknowledged the increased uncertainty but in their view the risk of higher inflation outweighs the risk to growth,"" Mr Berner said. The last time a Fed governor dissented was in September 2002, when the FOMC left rates on hold, but a former governor, Edward Gramlich favoured easing monetary policy. "
476,2004-11-10,2004-11-11,Financial Times,Blue-chips hold steady with all eyes on rates WALL STREET.,"US stocks greeted with a yawn the decision yesterday by the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point. As it became apparent that the Fed's assessment of the economy was similar to the previous time, the indices came down to this week's comfort zone on Wall Street: the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended barely changed at 10,385.48, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,162.90. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged off 0.4 per cent at 2,034.56, under pressure from a disappointing quarterly earnings report from Cisco Systems. The Fed reiterated its view that even after yesterday's rate increase, ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative"". Its policy- making Federal Open Market Committee also reaffirmed its commitment to tightening monetary policy at a ""measured"" pace, barring any changes in the economy that could jeopardise price stability. However, it described inflationary risks as ""well-contained"" in both the long and the short term. While yesterday's rate increase was expected, economists are now debating whether the Fed will repeat it in December, or pause its current cycle of tightening. Rory Robertson, interest rates strategist at Macquarie, said last week's blockbuster job creation data ""have made the need for the pause in December less obvious"". Francois Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Stearns, agreed that ""a tighter labour market only increases the likelihood of more Fed tightenings"" and pushed the thesis further, noting that ""future hikes can only compound the problem for stocks in 2005"". Mr Trahan sees the monetary policy outlook as one of several challenges faced by the US equity market. Another is technical resistance for the S&P 500 index at the 1,160 level. The mix of factors causes him to conclude: ""We expect the equity market rally of the past few weeks to go the way of previous ones and run out of steam shortly."" Meanwhile William Livesey, the chief technical analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned that recent intraday trading moves point to the end of a trend for stocks. ""If the market doesn't show some life soon the recent rally may be in trouble,"" he said. Crude oil futures rose after weekly data on petroleum inventories showed a rise in crude oil inventories but a decline in distillate products such as heating oil. The data raised the possibility of another run-up in oil prices amid fears of a shortage of heating oil as winter approaches. In economic news, the US government reported that the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected last month. Shares in Cisco Systems lost 6.6 per cent to Dollars 18.44 after the networking company reported in-line quarterly earnings and its forecasts disappointed some analysts. Shares in Advanced Medical Optics fell 8.6 per cent to Dollars 38.80 after the medical device maker agreed to buy Visx, whose shares soared 34.5 per cent to Dollars 24.36. Both companies specialise in eye care devices such as vision-correction lasers. The fall-out from the global withdrawal of Vioxx by Merck continued, with reports that a similar drug made by Pfizer caused similar negative side-effects. Shares in Pfizer eased 1.9 per cent to Dollars 27.47. However, Merck added 1.5 per cent to Dollars 26.41 and was among the leading gainers on the Dow. Among internet-related stocks, Yahoo was off 1 per cent at Dollars 36.66 while Google edged off 0.5 per cent to Dollars 167.86 amid news that a competing search service from Microsoft will be previewed this week. Microsoft shares were off 0.1 per cent to Dollars 29.73 by the close. Hewlett-Packard shares lost 3.7 per cent to Dollars 18.97 and those of Dell Computer were 1.6 per cent lower at Dollars 36.85 after analysts at UBS lowered their rating for the two stocks to ""neutral"". D.R. Horton shares put on 0.1 per cent to Dollars 31.80 after the housebuilder reported quarterly results that beat expectations as its profits rose 52 per cent. Federated Department Stores shares put on 0.1 per cent to Dollars 53.85 after the owner of the popular Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores reported quarterly results that exceeded estimates and gave an upbeat view of sales trends.

477,2004-11-10,2004-11-11,Financial Times,Fed lifts rate to 2% and keeps stance.,"* No change in policy which 'remains accommodative' * Italy raises prospect of intervention to stabilise euro The Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 2 per cent, the fourth consecutive increase since June. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that policy stance ""remains accommodative"" and that it expected to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's rate increase and the limited changes to its statement were widely expected, and financial markets were little changed. Italy's government last night appeared to raise the prospect of co-ordinated central bank intervention to stabilise the euro, highlighting European nervousness about the impact of its rise against the dollar on the eurozone's fragile recovery. Domenico Siniscalco, economy minister, was quoted by several news agencies as saying ""a co-ordinated intervention is being talked about again, not a unilateral intervention."" Mr Siniscalco later sought to clarify his remarks, telling the Financial Times he had merely been talking about the need to co-ordinate policy on the euro at the level of the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he meant simply that ""unilateral action makes no sense"" and made clear he had no knowledge of any intervention plans. Rob Nichols, US Treasury spokesman, said: ""I can affirm there has been absolutely no change in US policy in this area. We believe that currency values should be set in open and competitive markets."" In its statement, the Fed said ""output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labour market conditions have improved"". At its last meeting, the committee had indicated that the economy had ""regained some traction"" following the energy price rise and that labour market conditions had improved modestly. Some economists took that as a more positive statement on growth and the labour market. Others noted the Fed's characterisation of output growth as moderate. The Fed in effect left its options open. It provided no hint of an upcoming pause or a change in its strategy, but committee members have made clear that the measured pace language is not a commitment to raise rates at each meeting. ""The most important message is that the committee said that policy remains accommodative,"" said Dean Maki, economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York. There has been widespread speculation that the Fed will leave rates on hold at its December meeting, although following the strong October payroll report released on Friday the futures markets have priced in the probability of another rate in increase at the meeting. Ten regional Federal Reserve Banks requested a quarter-point increase in the discount rate to 3 per cent, but the San Francisco and Dallas Feds did not. This is not necessarily any indication of a dissenting view, although Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed and non-voting member of the FOMC, stressed the downside risks to the growth outlook in a recent speech. The federal funds rate, at 2 per cent, is still seen as well below the level seen as consistent with price stability over time. The central bank is likely to press ahead with rate increases while there is no sign that tighter monetary policy risks destabilising the economy. Lex, Page 16 "
478,2004-11-10,2004-11-11,Financial Times,Italy raises the prospect of intervention on euro: Comments show eurozone nerves over single currency's strength against dollar.,"Italy's government last night raised the prospect of co-ordinated central bank intervention to stabilise the euro, highlighting European Union nervousness about the impact of its rise against the dollar on the eurozone's economic recovery. Domenico Siniscalco, Italy's economy minister, was quoted by several news agencies as saying: ""A co-ordinated intervention is being talked about again, not a unilateral intervention. That would not help."" There had already been an attempt to stabilise the euro at Dollars 1.20, he was reported as saying. The euro briefly touched a new peak at Dollars 1.3005 during the afternoon in London but eased to Dollars 1.289 in late New York trading. The last broad intervention in currency markets by the world's large central banks was in 2000 when the euro was languishing at Dollars 0.86. Mr Siniscalco later sought to clarify his remarks, saying to the Financial Times he had merely been talking about the need to co-ordinate policy on the euro at the level of the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he meant simply that ""unilateral action makes no sense"" and made clear he had no knowledge of any intervention plans. But his comments followed the unexpected change in tone earlier this week by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, when he drew attention to the suddenness of the rise of the euro. Last night the ECB said it had ""no comment"" on Mr Siniscalco's remarks. But Ken Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas, said the Italian government ""had let the cat out of the bag"" and that it was probable that the ECB had discussed the possibility of intervention. Mr Siniscalco's remarks came as the US Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 2 per cent, the fourth consecutive increase since the Fed's June meeting. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement largely unchanged from September's meeting. It said that following yesterday's rate increase its policy stance ""remains accommodative"" and that the committee expected to be able to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's rate increase and the limited changes to its statement were widely expected, and financial markets were little changed. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, has been issuing the most strident warnings recently about the effect of the euro's rise. Italian officials said Rome was in regular ""technical contact"" with the ECB. The eurozone's economic recovery this year has been led by exports but third-quarter gross domestic product figures tomorrow are expected to show a slowdown. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said the existence of half the world with semi-fixed exchange rates against the dollar and others with floating rates was causing big conceptual problems in the management of the world economy. Presenting the Bank's latest Inflation Report yesterday, he said: ""The difficulty is that any adjustment of the dollar is likely to fall against the currencies which float against the dollar, and the biggest is the euro, and this burden of adjustment should be spread more widely.""

479,2009-03-18,2009-03-19,Financial Times,Treasury bonds gyrate as Fed's shock move causes confusion,"Traders struggle to make sense of plan Thirty-year Treasury bond yields gyrated wildly yesterday as traders struggled to make sense of the Federal Reserve's plans for buying government debt. The yield on the 30-year bond plunged as much as 42 basis points to 3.38 per cent after the Federal Open Market Committee said it had ""decided to purchase up to $300bn of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"". But the yield subsequently rose sharply in response to a statement issued 25 minutes later by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that was meant to clarify the central bank's buying plans. The New York Fed said its open market desk - which trades bonds with dealers - ""will concentrate purchases in the two- to 10-year sector of the nominal Treasury curve, although purchases will occur across the nominal Treasury and TIPS yield curves."" Traders dumped 30-year bonds in response, sending the yield back to 3.70 per cent. By contrast, yields for the five-, seven- and 10-year notes did not experience a similar rise. ""A lot of people got twisted up in the curve,"" said Rick Klingman, managing director at BNP Paribas. ""Long-term Treasuries, to dealers, implies securities between 10 and 30 years."" By late yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond had fallen back to 3.52 per cent. That was down 28bp for the day. In contrast, the 10-year note was down 51bp to 2.49 per cent, near its low for the day late in New York, while the seven-year note was down 54bp at 2.08 per cent. ""There is a slight bit of confusion at this point about exactly what part of the curve the Fed will be targeting,"" said Ted Wieseman, economist at Morgan Stanley. In general, the Fed move to buy Treasuries was a major shock for dealers, as Fed officials had downplayed such an action in recent speeches. Moreover, many traders had expected pressure on the Fed to buy Treasuries would only emerge should 10-year yields rise towards 3.5 per cent. John Spinello, strategist at Jefferies & Co said: ""The market had expected the Fed would focus on buying more mortgages and not target the purchase of Treasuries at their current yield levels.""

481,2009-03-18,2009-03-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT interview: Spencer Dale,"The following is an edited transcript of an interview between Chris Giles and Norma Cohen of the Financial Times and Spencer Dale, chief economist of the Bank of England, held on March 19 2009 FT: I suppose we should start with the economy. We're now a month on from the inflation report. What do you think has changed? How bad is it? SD: In absolute terms, it's bad. Output fell by 1.5% in Q4 and it looks like it's going to fall by a similar amount in Q1. So in the absolute sense, it's bad. I don't think the data since the February inflation report has changed the picture that much, and in some sense, I think are consistent with the broad story which was told in the inflation report, which was, first of all, the gradual easing in the rate of contraction during the middle of this year, so it's continuing falls in Q1 and starting to see some sort of easing in the rate of contraction, and with the possibility of some signs of recovery by the turn of the year. And that was the central view in February. And I think the data, since then, has been largely consistent with that. Now, it's one month's data and who knows, but it's been largely consistent with that. FT: The estimates in the February inflation report suggest that at the end of Q1, we are three quarters of the way through the contraction, as far as my estimate of your quarterly path goes. Do you think we are three quarters of the way through the recession? SD: It's very hard to say so I'm not going to, it's difficult to know. A story, in the central view, which is there's contraction coming through and a gradual recovery by the turn of the year as a significant stimulus that plays out would suggest that we've seen a substantial amount of the total contraction we're going to see has come through. But, A, there is a clear downside risk to that and, B, I think your question was framed in terms of recession. And I always get worried about recessions because statisticians can have one view of recessions and if people are losing their jobs or houses, they can have a very different view of recessions. And so I worry about being too particular and too technical about contractions about, but I think in a central view, we would have seen a substantial amount of the contraction that we expect to see by the time we get through the first half of this year. FT: And the IMF forecasts, although this is obviously unofficial at the moment, are worse than the central view, and I think actually worse than the mean of your forecasts. So they had in mind 3.8 and a very small negative number for 2010 which suggests a fall in output, through the whole of this year. Do you feel that's then a slightly too negative view? SD: I don't want to comment on the IMF data because I haven't seen the IMF data. It's one of those worlds where, I think the press think they've seen the IMF data but we certainly haven't because I don't think they're finalised yet. They certainly haven't been published yet so I can't comment on their data. I guess there are two stories here. The fundamental story is that we have a significant amount of stimulus feeding through this economy, partly related to the b monetary and fiscal stimulus we've seen and the support provided by the banking package. And then on top of that, the reduction we've seen in sterling and the reduction that we've seen in energy commodity prices. You add all those up; the scale of that stimulus is significant and significantly greater than that seen in comparable points in previous recessions. So that's why, in some sense, all forecasters are going to have a view of recovery at some point. And then we're asking, how quickly does it come through? And I guess point number one of that is, it's hugely uncertain and there are risks. I think one reason why I think my view is the data, thus far, has come in consistent with the view that we will start to see this easing in the pace of contraction through this year, and there are gradual signs of recovery, are the data since February report have been consistent with that. They saw the basic components of that. One is, we do see, we've seen a substantial de-stocking in the Q4 data, so a significant part of the falling out in Q4, which related to stock building. We know that, for stock building to continue to make that sort of contribution to growth, we need firms to keep running down their stocks at ever increasing rates - we know that can't happen. So just arithmetically, at some point, we would expect that stock cycle to come to an end as stocks get back to more normal levels. I don't know how much thought or what the IMF's view is, or other people's views are on that stock cycle. So that's one aspect. I think some other bits, you can point to some of the indicators which do seem to have started to stabilise and the key output stabilises; CIPS services indicators, they've stopped falling for three months. One can talk about the retail sales data that has held up a little bit better. You know, there are a number of pieces of data which are weak, in any absolute sense, but they're not continuing to get weaker and weaker, which is what you would expect to see. Who knows about the precise pattern? And I think I feel more confident about the fact that we will see a gradual recovery. There's no precise timing, but I think some of these components you can point to. The other thing in the Q4 data which is encouraging was the contribution from net trade, where particularly on the import side, there are signs, when you look at what's happening to the pattern of expenditure and relative to imports, it appears that you start to see some signs of expenditure switching from foreign produced output to domestic output. It's exactly the role we'd expect the exchange rate to play both in terms of imports and exports, and there were signs of that in the data as well. FT: I suppose if you were to play devil's advocate, you would point to other bits of data like the manufacturing or the industrial production data which was very weak at the start of Q1. And the downward revisions to other countries, so we would expect that exports, even if imports are falling very fast, exports are also going to be falling pretty fast. And so our international contribution to growth is probably worse than we thought a little while ago. How do you see the downside risks at the moment? SD: I think there are two or three downside risks. One downside risk clearly is what's happening in the world, and I wouldn't disagree with you that, on balance, the data about the world, the global outlook since February has been to the downside. The somewhat encouraging aspect of that is my impression from going to international meetings, and this was consistent with the governor's read from the G20 which he mentioned in his speech the other day, was when you sit around a table with other policy makers from other countries, you do get the impression that there's a very clear understanding of the need for policy makers to respond boldly and decisively to what's going on. So I think the world economy is a risk but that risk is mitigated somewhat by the determination of policy makers, and I think that was, a good example of that is in terms of the FOMC's decision yesterday. That's one risk. The second risk, which is another global risk, but it's both here and abroad, is in terms of the speed with which we manage to stabilise the banking system and get normal levels of bank lending happening again, and the financial markets stabilised. If we end up with a more sluggish recovery, that could be one strong candidate. If we were at a year's time and it was lower, and you say well, where did you go wrong? That would be one. And I think the third thing where it could go wrong is just the confidence effects. I think a key part of understanding the dynamic of the slowdown thus far is that we've seen a fall off in confidence. And the ability of policy makers, I think at the moment, part of what policy makers do is, they need to do the fundamental policies in the right way to stimulate demand, but also they need to make sure that they communicate those policies in such a way so as to provide reassurance to households and corporates about the future. FT: Was the trans-Atlantic spat between Finance Ministers over whether they were doing sufficient fiscal stimulus and other stimulus last week helpful in terms of communication? SD: I wasn't involved in the G20 thing at all so I can't comment on whether there was a spat or anything about that. FT: What can policy makers do to create confidence? What is the right strategy? You've done a lot of work on communications. What is the right thing to do? SD: One aspect of what to do is to go out and communicate more clearly and more urgently about your view of the economy. I think you have to tell it straight. Things are bad at the moment. Output is falling. Unemployment is rising. I think you have to tell that straight. But then you also have to say this is what we are doing about it and this is why we think we will gradually start to see signs of recovery towards the end of this year. And explain that outlook and explain the policy actions you're doing to that. I think there's also a potential role, and this is more a potential fiscal policy role than a monetary policy role, but you can think about designing policies which help to provide safety nets in the case of bad events. So for example, in a world where confidence is low and uncertainty is high, it makes sense for, households and corporates may start to behave quite cautiously - financial pull back in investments, households increase their cautionary savings, and for some households and corporates, that's a very sensible and prudent thing to do. They should do that. But the risk is, in a world where confidence is low, far more people behave in that way than actually are likely to be affected by the economy, and that acts to exacerbate the downturn. And so one role for policy makers is to find that safety net. An example of that would be the mortgage holiday that the government announced where if you go through a period of temporary hit to income, that you have ability to defer mortgage interest payments for a couple of years. That may end up providing reassurance to far more households than will actually ever use the policy, so it can provide that sort of reassurance aspect. I think the primary thing is for policy makers to do their jobs properly, which is to be clear, set the right policies and be clear and transparent in explaining why they think they will work. But then we also want to think about the design of some policies to help act as a safety net. FT: Can you think that, your characterisation of what some households might be doing, that it's right for some to be cautious but for others, they may actually be exacerbating the downturn. Is that a sense of what is happening at the moment? SD: I'm not sure that you can see, that you would point to many things at the moment to suggest it's happening at the moment. I think, compared with many commentators, and compared to my own priors, retail sales data over December, January period have held up stronger than you would have thought. If you look at consumer confidence measures, they've tended to pick up. And it's striking that the components of the consumer confidence measures, which have picked up most, are the forward looking components. That may help people feel more confident about their own personal situation I don't think I'm seeing it (the detrimental effects of excessive savings) yet, but I think it's a risk. FT: And is there excessive saving among companies, because investments have fallen? SD: Investment has fallen. Investment retention remains very low. Now, in a world where you expect output to be pretty sluggish, your capacity within your firm is pretty comfortable at the moment and credit conditions are tight. It would be odd if investment retentions were bullish. It's not obvious that they seemed to have moved by and extreme amount. And again, you can point to some of the most recent surveys where business confidence has come off its real low levels. All these measures remain absolutely low but they don't seem to be showing continual falls. You're not seeing that in some of those indicators. FT: Both you and the Governor have now said that you're doing more in terms of stimulus than in any time in the bank's history. Do you have a rule of thumb or something that gives us a sense of, in normal times, how much of a boost to both growth and inflation all the bits of stimulus would deliver? These range from monetary, fiscal and everything that's going on, low energy prices - there are a lot of things - how big is that and what would we think about that? And then how have our thoughts changed given the financial crisis? SD: No, is the answer. I don't. And it's hard because a lot of these stimuli are themselves in response to the shocks that we are facing. Therefore, the mechanisms by which they're responding are different. So I don't think it's simple to say that demand shock is doing this, the stimulus is doing that, and you add them up and you get to a number. I'm not sure I can think of a way of doing that. FT: Okay. But in normal times, it is large. And you go around saying it's a largest in 300 years, so you must have a sense… SD: I think the Governor has talked about the actions. It is up to the Governor to say what he says. But the point I made was the stimulus, as a whole, in terms of monetary, fiscal, exchange rate, the falls in commodity prices - we had a nice little table in the last inflation report - when compared with previous recessions and it's just very large. Now, the impact of a bank rate cut when spreads are rising and firms aren't lending is somewhat less. So you have to offset the effect of that stimulus. But in some sense, that's a shock to which you're responding, and that's why I'm reluctant to try and give any rule of thumb because I'm not sure I meaningfully can. FT: Does this mean that it's actually very hard for us and you to have any faith in your monetary [?] output and your inflation and growth forecasts because really, we don't know either the demand side or the stimulus side? Are we pretty much in the dark?. SD: No. All economic forecasts are uncertain. Are you telling me I'm certain about my forecast? No. I'm completely uncertain and if anything, we're more uncertain at the moment than in normal times. And I think the Bank has consistently bored you and many others explaining the importance of thinking about forecasts of distributions and the importance of stressing risks and so on. That remains even more the case now than before. All I'm saying is I think if you ever ask me to tell, at any point, in any forecast, can you separate out, into a forecast where you're taking all the different components together, can you parcel out each of those effects and would you have confidence? I don't think I would. FT: But you are thinking of different interest rates paths, so you do have…? SD: Yes, so I can do that one experiment, yes. FT: If you can't do that, you must have vague rules of thumb in your mind. We know the stimulus is big, and I don't want to belabour the point. But if you're trying to raise confidence and make sure that people don't become depressed about how badly the economy and you want to do it at a time when it does look very difficult, it is important to have some sense of how big it is. And I've been trying to ask a lot of policy makers… SD: Have they already given you an answer yet? FT: They've tried. SD: What I could do, and I don't have the numbers to hand; I could run experiments where I could say suppose, just holding everything else constant, commodity and oil prices fell, that increases purchasing power of families, what would that do to consumption? Hold that. And then I could do the next bit. I could add all that up. I must admit, for a household who is concerned about unemployment and worried about their job, they may find that a bit of an odd thing. They may think it odd to hear that they are better off and that their consumption should rise when they may be completely different in a world where they're thinking about the fact that their house has lost value and the guy down the road has lost his job. FT: I'm not going to continue asking the same question you won't answer. Saving on households, you've said that you've been rather surprised that retail sales have been holding up. Do we trust the ONS retail numbers now? Are we more confident in those relative to the retailers? And is it the time to expect a big rise in savings in more households now? SD: The ONS data, I think the values data for the ONS, the discrepancy between that and the surveys in recent months has lessened, and so I think all data, we tend to place weight on both. But the discrepancy between those two has lessened in terms of the values data. The reason why I'm stressing this value volumes thing is we know that the deflator used by the ONS is, the weights are out of date and they will be revised, and that when they are revised, it is very likely that the volumes data will be revised down. And so in some sense, I know that now and I'm taking that into account, but it's important, so I'm not going to be surprised with the volumes data… FT: It goes down backwards as well [?], will they? SD:Yes. FT: But even though some of the retail sales data and industry surveys were not as bad as expected, it is clear that demand for durable goods and even intermediate goods is still very weak, if not still falling. Does that concern you, the fact that big ticket items are not going on sale? Big ticket items don't appear to be to be moving in this economy.. SD: In some sense, I had expected part of the contraction output I expect to see, and have seen, I think is a function of consumption falling. And relative to that benchmark, the surprising thing is that retail sales haven't come off more. The durables consumption in some sense was part of the story, just as I was expecting to see. And I think what we need to see further ahead is what is going to happen to the savings ratio? Are we just seeing different parts of the consumption basket adjusting in different ways or, as is sometimes the case, that the durables consumption is reacting more quickly to shocks, and you're going to see this permeate into other types of consumption? And I think that's a key risk and that's exactly the key risk I was talking about earlier. If we see a substantial rise in the savings ratio - and we do expect the savings ratio to pick up - or put another way, if we see households reacting to the increasing uncertainty by increasing the levels of savings, they want to save for, buffer stops and save for rainy days, that will cause the recovery to be delayed and postponed. FT: Is there a level of savings rates that you would regard as troubling, say a pattern that emerged similar to that of the 1990s, post the 1990s recession? SD: No, because again, and I know I'm not very helpful here but it all depends on the context in what it's doing, so I don't think there's any one variable. But if we saw it shooting up and up, and nothing else is filling its place, then clearly that's going to mean that demand growth is less than you would otherwise have. And that's, in terms of our desire to stimulate normal demand, that's going to be problematic. FT: You set QE according to your sense of the outlook, and presumably some sense of the most likely outlook? What will you do if things get worse despite QE? SD: We do more. The purpose of QE is just like the purpose of setting interest rates more generally, or the monetary policy more generally. We do whatever it takes in order to hit the inflation target. If the economy does not respond enough, the thought experiment is exactly the same with interest rates. If you learn that the demand shock is greater than you think it is, then you will act on that policy and take the actions accordingly, in order to achieve the objective. FT: What's your sense of how QE is most likely to work to boost nominal spending? There are many channels that you have, which are the important ones? SD: Right. Again, my primary answer to that question is, 'I'm not sure'. I will give you a more helpful answer as well, but my general philosophy going into this is to be incredibly pragmatic and eclectic. We don't know the pace and the relative size of these different channels, and we're going to learn about that. We should enter this as an approach, rather than saying, 'This one is going to work and this one doesn't work and we're going to push on this rather than that.' In my view, we should go in saying, 'We'll see and we'll learn, and we'll adjust accordingly.' Now, let me help you out a little bit more, by saying what sort of different channels am I hoping to see, and I guess mine are a bit hard, because they're not completely distinct. I think that there are three different channels through which this can operate. First, we're buying gilts on the curve, and that's caused yield already on the curve to fall quite significantly. Over time, that's going to lead to a reallocation of investors' portfolios into other types of assets, such as corporate bonds. That will then, in principle lead to a lowering in the yields on those other types of borrowing, and a corresponding increase in the price of assets. That has a story where borrowing rates available to household and corporates should come down in line. The second channel is we've increased significantly the degree of liquidity in the economy. That liquidity by itself may help to stimulate borrowing and lending, so banks' deposits are likely to increase substantially as a result, as a first line of these asset purchases. They now have a ready source of funding to finance additional borrowing, if they wish. As this liquidity permeates out to the corporate sector, companies may feel less hindered by the need to haul liquidity and make them feel more comfortable undertaking certain types of spending, investment decisions. Liquidity is improved, so that's the second channel. And, the third channel is the purchases we're making of private sector assets, to improve the functioning of corporate markets. If they're successful, then you have proven that liquidity in those corporate markets should enable firms to be able to (improve). The availability of credit to corporates will improved, and allows firms to more easily raise finance via those capital markets at lower spending costs. That again has a cost channel effect, and also it helps to take some of the pressure off the banks as well. So, they're my three channels for which…now, I think many people would have other variants, but they're the three that I can fit various other things in. FT: And, in those, how do you think it's going in those three areas so far? SD: I'm afraid we can't say very much. It's a bit like saying when we change bank rates and after a week, we say, how is it going? FT: We've seen corporate bonds [overtalking]. SD: But, there's encouraging bits of news. We can't say much but there are some encouraging signs. I guess I would say there were three encouraging signs. Let me just…the first one isn't quite a price thing, but it relates to some of the communication things we were saying earlier. The reception, the reaction to the announcement, both by the financial markets and the public more generally, I think, has been pretty measured. People seem to understand what we're trying to do and why we're trying to do it, and that, I think, is an encouraging thing. I think it's an encouraging development. Some people have criticised the policy, of course. Some say we do too much, some say we're not doing enough and that's only right and proper. But I think I'm encouraged by the general measured and informed reaction. Secondly, we have seen gilt yields respond to the announcement at our initial purchases. Gilt yields are down, depending on where you look at the curve, by about 60 to 80 basis points, and if you look at non-financial corporate bond yields, they're down 30 to 50 basis points. You've already got some of the impacts feeding through into lower funding costs. The third thing is in terms of our operations within specific credit markets, we announced today our corporate bond scheme, and we put a market notice out today, explaining the operations, and those operations start next week. Within the commercial paper market, it seems to be having the sort of effects we want, in the market intelligence and the analysis we're doing shows people are able to issue commercial paper at tighter spreads than was the case before. We've had companies coming up to us, saying,' I wasn't sure whether to issue my commercial paper directly to you, or into the market, so I've actually decided to do it into the market, because I can actually get the paper away at the same price at which you were offering, which a month ago would have been impossible,'. I think we are starting to see some of those dividends. FT: Are you hearing from businesses in some of the really hard pressed sectors that they are able to finance more easily? SD: The people we're speaking to are those who are registered with our scheme to issue commercial… FT: Those are existing commercial paper issuers, right? SD: They don't have to be existing, because they can join the scheme. They don't have to be. There is no rule here, which I think may have been the rule in some other countries that you'd have to have an existing programme. You have to have a rating, so there's a process you have to go through, but there's nothing stopping a new firm going through that process. FT: There has been some speculation that the Bank might be uncomfortable with certain aspects of the asset purchase facility, because in effect it required you to take on credit risk. I realise that you're talking about high quality bonds, but I've been picking up that there was some discomfort about relying solely on credit ratings, or heavily on credit ratings in making your judgement. To what extent is this weighing on your considerations? SD: There are two issues here. One is, in terms of the credit risk, we have a government indemnity for all the risk associated with these operations, so in that sense, that's only right and proper and so it's not affecting, it won't have any risk to our balance sheet. I think more generally, the general point is many people's interpretation of what are the contributory factors to the general crisis we're going through at the moment is that rating agencies are fallible and that we need to find other ways. We shouldn't rely 100% on ratings. In that world, it would seem a bit odd if we set up new schemes and said,'All we're going to look at is the rating agency and they're perfect.' I think our response is just we know ratings aren't perfect, and we're going to use them, but we use other things as well as cross checks. I hope everybody will get to the point where they all think hard about ratings agencies and stop relying 100% on them. FT: I didn't think of that as one of your natural tasks. Are you going to outsource that in some way, or how are you going to do the analysis? I don't think there are corporate bond analysts at the Bank. SD: No, that's perfectly true. I think we developed some of those skills when we were doing the SLS, and I think we are buying in some of those skills as well. FT: Mm-hmm, from existing investment advisers? SD: Or via hiring people as well. FT: I see. SD: In terms of managing credit risk, you first of all work out the riskiness of the asset. That is the point you're making about the process we're going to use to do that. Then you then go out and you set the appropriate haircuts to cover you for that risk,. There's always clearly uncertainty in these things, so there's always a risk that you may suffer losses. But in principle, those haircuts over a period of time should provide sufficient compensation to cover for any individual losses. FT: Is it possible that the haircut that now exists in the market is exactly what is needed, and that you won't be able to offer spreads any better? SD: Okay, so this is a key point. What we're trying to do here is not affect credit spreads. What we're trying to do here is the over and above credit spreads, liquidity premia look high. For a plausible level of credit spreads, the overall spread just looks too big and what we're trying to do is not directly affect credit spreads, because that would seem an odd thing for us to try and second guess other people. What we're saying is for plausible estimates at credit spreads, the overall credit spread we're seeing is significantly greater than that and that reflects liquidity problems. What we're trying to do in each of these markets is not manage our credit spreads, but reduce the liquidity premium. FT: Can you decompose the spread into credit liquidity effectively, do you think? SD: You can do a whole range of different models. You can use things like Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) as one way of doing it. You can do fundamental analysis about the likelihood of default. You can do historical analysis of defaults in previous recessions and you can do a whole range and then you can cross, and you can get your best estimate. You can't perfectly do it, but there's a range of techniques which you can use to produce different estimates. FT: There have been suggestions, and in fact it said so in the minutes, that actually this asset purchase facility would be a very small part of the sum, and there was some suggestion that small meant 10 to 15 billion perhaps, but not much more than that. Are we right in thinking that? SD: So I think there's a danger of comparing apples and oranges when we're comparing the operation to increase the supply of money in the economy by buying assets and what we're trying to do in terms of the credit markets. What we're trying to do in terms of the credit market is improve liquidity. Now, in lovely textbook models, if a person comes along with huge pockets and said, 'I'm all trading this market and increasing liquidity,', they end up never having to actually buy anything, because just the knowledge that they stand ready means everybody starts trading with each other and its success. FT: And, what do you think you can do? SD: I'm not suggesting that we have unlimited, deep pockets and so on, but part of what we're doing here is, if we're successful, an element of success could correspond to us actually purchasing very few assets over a period of time. If the market has improved, liquidity has improved and (markets) can start to differ again, in that world that would be a definition of success,. It is not a definition of somehow the programme is not pulling it's weight or being important,. The amount of assets we're going to have to purchase to generate that, we don't know that yet. But it shouldn't be seen as an indicator of its relative importance. FT: Now, from your perspective, thinking about QE generally speaking, it's most ideal if the people who tender their bonds to you are not banks, ultimately, they're investors. Do you have measures in place to figure out who the ultimate tenders are? SD: We have a whole range of different indicators. As you well know, via the auctions, we buy it via the gilt-edged market makers so we don't observe (end sellers) that directly. We have a whole range of indicators, including market intelligence, where we're going out and just speaking to people, and finding it out, so over a period of time, I think we will learn who these sellers are. FT: Yes, I had talked to some of the institutional holders of bonds who said that their bids weren't being taken up. They thought that your initial auctions may have consisted of quite a bit of loose stock, and I just wondered whether you had some measures in place to either tilt your auction to ensure that you get it from those who are not the depositors. In other words, to put it into the hands of those who are likely to recycle it in some way? SD: No, so I don't think we're going to tilt the auctions in one way or another, because I think the nature of the auction is it's impossible to know who those investors are, if they're dealing via an intermediary. I guess I'd make two points. My understanding is that bank holdings of gilts are pretty minimal compared to the amounts we're doing. Therefore the risk that we're going to buy a substantial amount of gilts from banks, I don't think is likely. Secondly, to the extent that banks do hold gilts, they will tend to hold shorter maturity gilts. We're not buying gilts with a maturity of less than five years. Part of the reason why we chose the maturity ranges was to ensure that there was less chance of us buying gilts from banks. I think those two reasons mean I am reassured that this is not a first order issue. FT: And, the reason you don't want to buy from banks, is that just because of the money market channel, or the channel that they will buy another asset? SD: Well… FT: Because it's going to end up in a bank anyway? SD: Yes, one way of characterising this is by not purchasing from the banks you know almost certainly you're going to get an increase in bought [?] money and so you can then start with those types of channels, and start to offer that. FT: Yeah, but you get an increase in M4 anyway, if you bought from a bank? SD: No, I don't think you do. But, more generally, by going to non-bank investors, there's less chance that if banks are catching the strain at the moment and aren't keen to lend out, there's clearly some risk that the banks won't actually lend out those funds. If we are able, and if we start dealing with non-banks, that mitigates that issue. We start to see this reallocation of the rest of the portfolio, which we were talking about. FT: One of the things that you were just talking about, brings up the whole issue of exit strategy. If you could just be the guy with deep pockets and you don't actually have to do anything, just the announcement effect solves everything. In terms of exit strategies, how quickly can you roll back QE, do you think? SD: As quickly as we put it in, and I think that's really important. So, the inflation target is symmetric, therefore our behaviours have to be symmetric. We will need to be equally as bold and decisive when we're withdrawing this thing as it is when we put it in. The key point of what we're doing here is trying to hit the inflation objective, the inflation target objective. That's the whole raison d'etre of QE and therefore the amount of QE we've been doing and the automatic purchases we carry out initially will be a function of our view of the medium term outlet of inflation, and how it relates to the inflation target. Likewise, the time at which we start taking the stimulus out, by combination of both reversing the assets with purchases and also by raising bank rates will be a function of the outlook relative to the inflation targets. The good news is as an exit strategy, that's very open, it's transparent and it's open to public scrutiny by people such as yourself. You can hold us to account, to make sure that we are behaving exactly the way we say we are. FT: But you're sort of talking about auctions of five or six billion a week? SD: Yes, but my view is that just because you (used) bank rates at some sort of effective way around and then started QE doesn't mean, I think, you have to go back in the same way. If the market sees ordering reasons, there's a limit on the pace of which you sell back gilts. Then you can raise bank rates at the same time. FT: How will you know when it's time to roll back? What will you look for, to tell you that QE has worked and now is the time to roll back? SD: Our forecast for inflation will be sustained, that if we don't roll back, we'll overshoot the inflation target, so I'm sorry, I know it's a bit of a banal answer to your question, but ultimately all of this will be judged by the outlook for inflation targets, just like all other monetary policy actions. FT: Would you expect, for instance, would you be looking at things like M4 stripped out for interbank transactions? Is it guidelines like that to tell you this is working? SD: I don't think our approach to analysing the economy is going to be substantially different to before, so if you had come to me a year ago and asked what key factors are you going to look at, to decide when you're going to cut rates, I would have said, I can't tell you, because I'm going to look at the whole economy. I am going to look at it in that context, and we'll see what that says about the medium term outlook for inflation and we'll make that judgement. That is true when we're reversing this policy as well. I think there's potential for misunderstanding. That is because particular variables, like nominal demands, having increased in importance and somehow that now becomes a key indicators of what we're trying to do. I don't think that's right. I think at any one point in time in the economy, when you're looking at particular shocks you must try to understand the nature of that shock. You focus on a particular variable. That doesn't mean that variable has suddenly risen in status and has become some sort of intermediate target or some key indicator. Rather it's when you're trying to understand the nature of that shock, you focus on it at the moment. The nature of the monetary and credit contraction we're seeing at the moment means the growth brought of credit, the growth of nominal demand are key features in understanding the nature of the shock. That is why we're going to look at those, but the general approach to policy is exactly the same as always. We look at all the variables and take a view about the medium term outlook. FT: Can you envisage a world…is this impossible, that you could have QE to be very effective on nominal demand and very ineffective on real demand? So, that we get real demand being extremely sluggish, maybe even contracting, but we get a lot of inflation and not much growth? So, the nominal demand doesn't actually have any real effect? SD: I think that what a Central Bank can do is stimulate nominal demand. What it's harder for it to do is control in a dynamic sense, and in a transitional sense the price volume split of that. We can help make sure that the inflation component comes out right by having a credible policy. That means that people's inflationary expectations are anchored around 2%. I think the likelihood of the sort of outcomes you're describing will depend in part on your view about the nature of the shocks affecting the economy at the moment. They depend to what extent are some of the adjustments we're seeing real adjustments. There's an adjustment in household balance sheet, which is the real thing, and monetary policy can make sure that adjustment is a smooth process, but it can't avoid that process. It that is a necessary adjustment in real spending? Will it give you a different path that is more likely than the split here.. FT: If, let's say, in a year or two's time we've had 2% inflation, so the inflation target has been hit perfectly but no growth at all, how would that make you as policy makers feel? SD: We'd be very uncomfortable. If you said to me now, would that be an acceptable outcome, if we hit the inflation target, I think the answer would be no. But then what we'd then have to understand is why that is. What is going on, and what factors are causing the real economy to be so weak, and is there a role for monetary policy to play there. If not, what other policies should we be doing? FT: Well, I just wanted to ask about something else about counter cyclical capital requirements. I don't know of anyone in the world who actually disagrees with the idea of it as the great new hope of banking regulation for the future. I guess it's for regulators to decide who has their fingers on the levers. But in another situation like we've just been in, where monetary policy is control and demand, and let's say everything works as we liked. Wouldn't the body controlling those counter cyclical requirements be in effect setting monetary policy because it would have the ability to control interest rates paid by households and businesses. That is because banks are profit maximising institutions and would price their loans to take account of higher capital requirements. SD: So, I am not sure about the separability proposition. I won't surprise you by being the first person in the world who disagrees with counter cyclical regulation. My view is that in terms of macro policy at the moment, there's a strong literature in understanding about the need for fiscal monetary coordination. I think what will go hand in hand with this developments is that we will bank regulators become more aware of the need for monetary regulatory coordination. I think the appropriate setting of bank rate will be a function of what is going on in terms of the regulatory authorities. If the regulatory authorities are behaving in such a way as to affect the volume and price at which credit is being offered, that will clearly have implications for monetary policy. That is why we need to have coordination. I think that argument is distinct from the idea which I also agree with, that bank rates alone are not a very good instrument to tackle these things with. The fact that it's not a very good instrument or a very effective instrument to try and tackle some of these problems doesn't mean it's entirely independent of it. Does that make sense? FT: So, on the first of those, are you saying that on monetary policy - and tell me if this is wrong - that you would want to lean against the wind, if the regulatory authorities were too lax? That you would want to set the bank rate to move accordingly? SD: What I was saying was in an ideal world, when the regulatory authorities were doing what you wanted them to do, that would have implications, just like the degree of fiscal stimulus has implications for bank rates. Likewise the nature of the regulatory authority and the extent to which that was being changed in response to risks would affect bank rates as well. FT: But, is that really a change from the past? Surely it's always been that way? SD: No, it's not a change from the past but if you move to a world where some aspects of the regulatory regime are designed explicitly in a classical way, that will be a different nature. The nature of the interaction will not fundamentally changed. It's just going to be heightened in importance. FT: So, you're saying that no, you wouldn't particularly see (monetary policy) leaning against the winds if the regulatory authorities fail? Or as we now believe they failed in the recent upswing, then you wouldn't now be thinking of setting tighter policy because bank rates are not the right tool? Do you hope that they would have had some tighter capital requirements or provision or whatever? SD: I'm saying that (monetary policy) remains our tool with contingency at bank rate to hit the inflation target. I remain of the view that bank rate is a pretty poor instrument to try and tackle some of these issues, and I hope as we go forward we learn from the errors we've made in the past that we get to a world where we have a regulatory regime better suited to avoid these sort of problems again. In the future, and all I was saying is, a corollary, an aspect of that will be a need for monetary and regulatory coordination. FT: Just to think through, so if the regulators or the authorities do set banking regulations such that it's tighter in the next upswing, how do you think that will affect interest rates, as faced by companies and households? Do you think that will affect those, if the spread over bank rates rise? SD: So, to an extent it does, to an extent that those regulatory regimes prevent banks or private pricing centres (from aggressive pricing) and that leads to an effective tightening, then yes. In that world, the appropriate start of bank rate would be different to a world where they won't be behaving that way. That is purely the point I was making. FT: Do you think that the channel through which monetary policy has worked in the past is going to be the same after this? SD: Yes, the fundamental structures of the economy can't change. The key channels through which the monetary policy operates won't change, but the appropriate setting of policy will be a function of other types of policies in existence. It is a function of fiscal policy and it's always been a function of the regulatory regime, but if the regulatory regime is being used in a more counter cyclical way, then that will have more direct feedback back onto the other bank rates."
482,1996-05-21,1996-05-22,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - US EQUITIES STEADY AHEAD OF FOMC - AMERICA - WALL STREET.,"US equities hovered near to Monday's closing levels in midsession trade as investors awaited the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.13 stronger at 5,756.95, the Standard &Poor's 500 was up 2.16 at 675.31 and the American Stock Exchange composite gained 3.16 at 612.52. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite added 3.09 at 1,251.20. NYSE volume was 230m shares. Few on Wall Street expected the Fed to change interest rates at yesterday's FOMC meeting, but economists remained divided about the direction of interest rates through to the end of the year. Therefore, many were hopeful that the Fed would release some indication of its view of the economy at the conclusion of the meeting. Stocks derived little direction from the bond market, which was also relatively flat. Among individual shares, oil companies in the Dow gave up some of the strong gains made on Monday after the conclusion of the United Nations deal to allow Iraq to sell oil to raise money for humanitarian aid. Chevron retreated $1 1/4 to $60 3/4, Exxon shed $1 1/2 to $86 and Texaco receded $1 5/8 to $85 1/4. Wellpoint Health Networks, a California health maintenance organisation (HMO), soared $12 1/2 or 48% to $38 5/8 as the HMO's parent, Blue Cross of California, completed its conversion to a for-profit company. Wellpoint retains use of the Blue Cross name for marketing purposes and Blue Cross donated $3bn to two healthcare foundations in order to repay the citizens of California for tax benefits it received while it was a non-profit company. ValuJet shares climbed $1 5/8 or 14% to $12 7/8, regaining some of the ground lost in the days since one of the airline's DC-9s crashed in the Florida Everglades, in spite of news that one of the company's founders had sold 1.5m shares on Monday. The company said the shares were sold to satisfy margin debt. For a second consecutive day, shares in Iomega jumped amid optimism about a two-for-one stock split that took effect yesterday. Shares in the company, which makes computer disk drives, added $6 or 15% at $47 3/8. Dayton Hudson rose $3 or 3% to $105 after the retailer reported stronger than expected first-quarter earnings of 49 cents a share. The mean estimate from analysts was for closer to 43 cents a share.

483,1996-05-21,1996-05-22,Financial Times,CURRENCIES AND MONEY - VERBAL SUPPORT TAKES DOLLAR TO 16 MONTH HIGH - MARKETS REPORT.,"The dollar yesterday rallied to a 16 month high against the D-Mark following verbal support for a stronger dollar from a senior Bundesbank official. Mr Olaf Sievert, a Bundesbank council member, provided the market with a signal to buy dollars when he told an audience in Leipzig that 'a rise of a few pfennigs in the dollar would be good for the German economy.' This took the dollar to an intra-day high of DM 1.5435 in Europe. It later closed in London at DM 1.5415, from DM 1.5347 on Monday. Against the yen it finished at Y 107.06, from Y 107.115. Earlier the dollar had been under some pressure following sceptical comments about European monetary union, which supported the D-Mark, from Mr Wilhelm Nolling, a former Bundesbank official. Sterling was a beneficiary of the firmer dollar, with the trade-weighted index finishing at 84.8, the highest level in the rally since hitting a historic low of 82.2 on November 20. Against the D-Mark it closed at DM 2.3331, from DM 2.3207. Against the dollar it finished at $1.5136 from $1.5122. Analysts pointed out that the three per cent rally in sterling effectively offset the 75 basis point cut in UK interest rates since last December. In Sweden, the central bank trimmed the repo rate to 6.5% from 6.7%. Activity was generally fairly subdued ahead of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the US, although there was little expectation of any shift in US interest rates. * The dollar's rally off historic lows last year against the yen and D-Mark has been so dogged that it has at times been possible to lose sight of the overall trend. But as recently as last October, the dollar was trading around DM 1.38, and in late February it was still down at DM 1.45. The dollar's rally looks more impressive when put into context. Mr Nick Parsons, currency strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, notes that for the first time in ten years the dollar has risen against the D-Mark for four quarters in succession. Against the yen, it has risen for three successive quarters, something not achieved since the dollar's great bull run ahead of the Plaza Accord in 1985. Economists at Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, note that from trough to peak, the dollar rallies of 1988-89, 1991 and 1992-93 each climbed by 20-25%. If the current dollar rally matches these gains, it will reach DM 1.65-70. Mr Brian Martin, economist at Barclays in London, said that while the trend towards 'gradual dollar appreciation' was clearly in place, it was in neither Germany or the US's interest to have the dollar appreciate faster. From the US perspective, there was the danger that it could hit export performance. Germany, meanwhile, depended on foreign bond purchases to finance its budget deficit, and hence 'had to be careful not to show that they favour longer term (inflationary) depreciation of the currency.' * While the market remains in favour of a stronger dollar, Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, advances a speculative thesis as to why the US government might favour a weaker currency. Mr Koo's premise is that the priority of Mr Robert Rubin, the US treasury secretary, is to achieve the re-election of President Clinton. He speculates that this might best be achieved through a 'stable and weak dollar' which would be advantageous to Wall st - 'a weak dollar would encourage Japanese investment in the USA and low long term interest rates' - and to Main st (by making US exports more competitive). A key part of Mr Koo's argument is that unlike in the Eighties, when Japanese investors 'pursued rising values', they now buy when prices are low. Mr Koo presumes Mr Rubin will have noticed this fact, and hence will favour a weaker dollar. 'US investment will not become particularly popular amongst Japanese investors if the dollar merely breaks through the Y 105 level. A fully fledged interest in US investment will only rise amongst domestic (Japanese) investors once the dollar has broken through (below) Y 100.' 'A level between Y 90-100 is the most suitable in terms of its impact both on structural reform and the economy,' says Mr Koo. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
484,2002-09-24,2002-09-25,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Equities depressed by further selling.,"It was another miserable session for investors in London stocks yesterday. Perceptions of a deteriorating global economy, increasing fears of a US-led strike against Iraq and worries about the grim outlook for corporate profitability dragged the main UK indices lower again, writes Steve Thompson, UK Stock Market Editor. Although closing off its lowest levels of the day, the FTSE 100 still closed down 1.8 per cent, at 3,671.1, its lowest level for more than six years. The worst performer among the main indices was the FTSE 250 which lost 106.5 - or 2.4 per cent - to 4,304.8, while the FTSE SmallCap lost 32.6 - or 1.8 per cent - to 1,813.4. The Techmark 100 plunged another 11.18, or 1.7 per cent, to a record low of 635.65. The pain in the market place looked set to continue, according to harassed traders. ""What makes it all the more depressing is that there doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel. If anything, matters are likely to get even worse,"" said one marketmaker. He said the prospect of a war in Iraq had increased significantly after the UK government provided evidence yesterday of Iraq's capacity to launch attacks with chemical and other weapons. Adding to the widespread pain being felt across the stock market was another confidence-sapping slide by Wall Street. The Dow Jones followed up Monday evening's 113 points retreat - having been down almost 200 points at one stage - with a further slide at the opening yesterday. The Dow lost a further 132 points before edging off its worst as London closed for the day, as the outcome of the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting loomed up. Traders expected the FOMC to leave US interest rates on hold again. The US consumer confidence index for September was no worse than the market had been expecting and was said to have helped in slowing Wall Street's slide. The latter has been hit hard in recent sessions by an ever-growing list of profit warnings and disappointing results and news from leading US companies, the most recent of which came from Novellus Systems. The financial sectors of the market continued to take the worst pain, with the banks once again being sold aggressively on the view that a worsening global economy will bring with it corporate casualties and increasing bad debts. Insurance stocks, meanwhile, were hit again by fears that the almost relentless slide in equity markets will leave the insurance groups at the mercy of regulators and trigger forced selling. Confirmation of the rumoured £200m rights issue from British Insurance reminded the market of the need for more fundraising in the sector. Royal &Sun Alliance is expected to tap its shareholders for about £1bn in the very near future. Turnover in equities was 2.7bn shares. Bargain hunters descend Bargain hunters moved in to mop up shares in the UK's life insurers on Tuesday, after sector stocks had sunk to multi-year lows amid fresh fears that plunging equity markets will herald forced selling and more rights issues. But the mood lifted in late trade and Mikir Shah of Fox-Pitt, Kelton said: ""Investors have realised that these companies aren't insolvent, they are continuing to write new business and that valuations look attractive"". As aresult Prudential closed 6 higher at 339p, having sunk to its lowest level since April 1995 earlier in the day. Aviva firmed 4 to 345p, rebounding from levels last seen in January 1989. But composite insurer Royal &Sun Alliance still dipped 1 1/2 to 94p, its lowest since September 1984. Despite the mild fightback, the UK life insurance sector has fallen 53 per cent since January 1. Earlier there had been market speculation that insurers may be forced to sell equities if the FTSE 100 falls to 3,500. ""It is no accident that people are starting to think that 3,500 is going to be magic figure,"" said Chris Rathbone of Williams de Broe. The resilience test set by the Financial Services Authority may force insurers' hands. The FSA relaxed the test in June. Rather than having to be able to remain solvent even if equity markets fall 25 per cent from their current level, insurers now merely have to be able to cope with a 25 per cent fall from the three-month moving average. This gave insurers a temporary respite, but with the three-month moving average on the FTSE 100 now 4,211, compared to 5,066 when the FSA made its ruling on June 28, that respite is over. ""The relaxation gives some leeway in the short-term, but doesn't help in the long-term,"" said Richard Schreuder of Barclays Private Clients. Elsewhere banks suffered again, amid concerns over a rising tide of bad debts if the faltering global economic recovery brings more companies to their knees. Sentiment was further weakened by Lehman Brothers of the US chalking up third-quarter net earnings of just 70 cents a share, compared to consensus expectations of 85 cents. Major fallers included Barclays, off 11 1/4 at 355p, HBOS, down 17 at 624 1/2p, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which slipped 37 to £11.95. Perennial contrarian stock Man Group firmed 47 at £10.18, on expectations that its hedge funds will continue to sell well in the current environment. Asset managers Amvescap and Schroders attracted bargain-hunters after recent steep falls. Amvescap added 3 at 305p and Schroders firmed 19 at 453p. In the telecoms sector, incumbent operator BT fell 9 3/4 to 162 1/2p following a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston. The bank said that the weak economic environment and the consequent curtailing of corporate spending mean BT will struggle to meet its internal growth forecasts. CSFB slapped an ""underperform"" rating on the stock and cut its revenue forecasts for 2004, 2005 and 2006 by 3 per cent, 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Fair value is now 160p a share, CSFB concluded. By Steve Johnson and Adam Plowright US Edition 1. "

486,2002-09-24,2002-09-25,Financial Times (FT.Com),Greenspan praises London's success story.,"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has hailed the success of London in staying ""at the top of the world's financial pyramid"" despite the creation of the euro. Speaking at the opening of the new UK Treasury building, Mr Greenspan said London had continued to thrive as a financial centre despite loss of empire, the revolution in telecommunications and the emergence of the European single currency. ""London has stayed on top in the provision of financial services despite the emergence of the euro, which some expected would divert a significant share of foreign exchange trading to a single centre on the continent,"" he said. ""Although financial sector activity in Frankfurt has increased substantially in the past few years, largely reflecting the growing importance of the euro, trading volumes there are still well below those of London and New York."" He cited as evidence of London's strength its world-leading positions in over-the-counter derivatives and foreign exchange trading. London conducts twice as much business as New York even though the dollar is by far the most heavily-traded currency. The resilience of Britain's financial services industry to staying outside the euro has been widely recognised, but eurosceptics were heartened to hear the points made by such an eminent authority. Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister), was unstinting in his praise for Mr Greenspan and the Fed, stressing the influence of the US model in shaping his plans to make the Bank of England independent. ""You have been a great force for the advancement of the world economy and a great friend of the United Kingdom,"" said Mr Brown. ""The world owes you a debt of gratitude for your stewardship of the world's greatest economy."" George Eustice of the anti-euro group, which will campaign for a ""No"" vote on any referendum on Britain joining the single currency, said London was thriving because of its favourable tax and regulatory framework. Locking into the euro would threaten some of those advantages. But Robert Guy, chair of the City in Europe ""Yes"" campaign and a director of NM Rothschild, said joining the euro would strengthen London's position as Europ e's pre-eminent financial centre and protect against threats such as the loss of exchange-traded derivatives business to Frankfurt. ""Current success is no excuse for lack of concern for the future,"" he said. The visit comes at a time of pronounced uncertainty for Mr Greenspan, the Federal Reserve and the US economy. The Fed decided on Tuesday to keep short-term interest rates unchanged for the sixth time this year, declaring credit conditions sufficiently stimulative to help the troubled economy along. But for the first time in a year, there was publicly declared internal dissent with its decision, highlighting growing disagreement within the Fed over the economy's prospects. Two members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee - Bob McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Edward Gramlich, a member of the Fed's board of governors - argued for a rate cut and publicly registered their disagreement. It was the first instance since May 1998 in which two FOMC members dissented. xref The Maestro, Page 11 Observer, Page 12. "
487,1999-10-05,1999-10-06,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Marseilles in euro-zone debut.,"Marseilles made its debut in euro-zone municipal bonds with an offering that had to compete for attention in a market preoccupied with the FOMC meeting. On asecond consecutive day of paltry issuance, the likely deliberations of the Fed, ahead of similar meetings by interest-rate setting bodies in the UK and the euro-zone later this week, dominated attention. The Marseilles issue was for EUR40m, small even in terms of yesterday's modest activity, but Warburg Dillon Read - joint lead with Dexia Capital Markets - said the aim was to establish the city's name in the market. The 10-year bond was pre-placed and attracted most investor attention from funds in the Benelux countries, followed by buyers in Germany. The borrower's 20 per cent risk weighting, which means it has to set aside less regulatory capital, was one attraction. Another was its triple-A rating, which was enhanced by a guarantee from MBIA, the US insurer. ""This was an opportunity for the city to speak to investors,"" said a banker at WDR. The proceeds will go towards the city's Euromed programme, a project to spruce up the city, one of France's most run-down. The bond is the second offering from French municipalities in recent weeks. Region Ile de France, which includes Paris and is one of the richest regions in the country, launched an eight-year EUR100m bond priced to yield 32 basis points over the OAT curve. The Marseilles offering was priced a little wider, at 36 basis points over the OAT, and traded unchanged in quiet secondary activity. In contrast to German states, French local authorities are relative newcomers to the public debt market, preferring traditional bank financing. The Inter-American Development Bank reopened its 10-year Y100bn bond with a Y50bn add-on. Since its first offering others, such as KfW, have tapped the yen market. The soaring yen has encouraged euro-based investors to buy Japanese assets. They have benefited from the rising currency, though Japanese investors with foreign bond holdings have been hit badly. However, the yen market has been held back because issuers have recoiled at the prohibitive cost of swapping out of yen into another currency. Despite that, bankers say the outlook for yen issuance should improve as anxieties over the millennium subside in the new year. ""We think this basis swap should contract next year after the Y2K problem has eased and that should enable better arbitrage and more issuance in yen,"" said Denis Kelleher at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International, joint lead on the IDB bond with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

488,1999-10-05,1999-10-06,Financial Times,WORLD NEWS - THE AMERICAS - Fed hints at future interest rate rise.,"US ECONOMY FEDERAL RESERVE KEEPS RATES UNCHANGED BUT SHIFTS - POLICY BIAS TO SUGGEST NEXT MOVE MAY BE UPWARDS. The US Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee shifted its policy bias yesterday to suggest its next interest rate move would be upwards. But it decided against an immediate change in rates, saying the strengthening productivity growth that had so far damped inflationary pressures had apparently been sustained. In a statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said members emphasised the tightening bias ""did not signify a commitment to near-term action"". The committee left its federal funds rate - the rate on overnight lending between banks - unchanged at 5.25 per cent and held its largely symbolic discount rate at 4.75 per cent. The statement said that although productivity trends were favourable, ""growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs"". ""In these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy,"" it said. Though this explained its bias towards a tighter future policy, it said it would still need to ""evaluate additional information on the balance of aggregate supply and demand and conditions in financial markets"" before deciding future interest rate moves. The committee raised interest rates by a quarter point at each of its previous two meetings in June and August but maintained its ""neutral bias"" in both cases. Most private sector analysts had not expected the Fed to change interest rates, although they were more evenly divided on whether it would make the shift to a tightening bias. Some economists said that despite indications of a tightening economy, the Fed had reason to be cautious because of factors associated with the impact of the millennium date change on computers. This could lead to a protective build-up in inventories by manufacturers and consumers that could distort the figures. However, some were still expecting the Fed to claw back by the end of the year every one of the three quarter-point interest rate cuts made last year. The focus will now shift to the next meeting, on November 16, as the most likely date for any rate increase. Lex, Page 24 Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

491,1999-10-05,1999-10-06,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Footsie makes progress ahead of US rate decision.,"London stocks enjoyed another reasonably good session yesterday, mostly based on the premise that the US Federal Reserve's open market committee would leave rates alone, and retain its neutral policy bias at yesterday's meeting. The FOMC's decision was due well after the London market closed last night. The assumption of unchanged rates, with the promise of more takeover action, had already helped drive Wall Street sharply higher on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average raced up 128 points, taking it 400 points clear of the 10,000 mark in the wake of the merger news involving Sprint, the US telecoms carrier. Wall Street gave additional support to London from the start of US trading yesterday when the Dow rose sharply, posting a 80-point gain in the first hour of action on Wall Street, following a batch of economic data in line with expectations including the US purchasing managers survey for the services sector which, although a strong figure, was in line with forecasts. London had its own fair share of takeover inspiration as well, with the bank sector accelerating throughout the session on news of the appointment of Warburg Dillon Read and Lehman Brothers as financial advisers to Abbey National. That was interpreted as signalling that bank's intention of becoming involved in the expected consolidation in the banking arena following the initial shot fired by Bank of Scotland at National Westminster. And dealers were quick to point out that United Biscuits' admission on Monday that it was involved in discussions with potential bidders, confirmed long-held expectations that other deals could be in the pipeline. ""There was a view that the new millennium would bring a spate of bids and mergers; it now looks as if the agenda has been brought forward,"" said one marketmaker. By the end of the trading session, the FTSE 100 index had successfully negotiated a handful of awkward passages, which saw it perilously close to slipping into negative territory. Footsie closed 31.6 higher at 6,084.5. At its best, in the middle of the morning, Footsie just managed to penetrate the 6,100 level, before dribbling back over lunchtime. The FTSE 250 also finished well off its best, suffering from a severe setback in a handful of stocks, including two of the UK's leading food manufacturers, Northern Foods and Tate &Lyle. And Morgan Crucible, another leading 250 stock, retreated after Dresdner Kleinwort Benson executed a neat bought deal, buying and selling a 2 per cent-plus stake in the company, netting a cool #250,000 in the process. The FTSE SmallCap ended 5.6 firmer at 2,683.7.

492,1999-10-05,1999-10-06,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Dow drops as Fed holds interest rates.,"US stocks sold off in the minutes after the Federal open market committee decided, as expected, to leave interest rates on hold, writes John Labate in New York. The committee moved to a tightening bias and shortly after the decision, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped and was up just 6.64 on the day at 10,407.87. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was down nearly 2 points at 1,302.62 while the tech-weighted Nasdaq composite was up 21.77 at 2,817.74. Fed policy aside, investors had plenty to occupy their minds. Leading the way was the proposed merger between MCI/Worldcom and number three long-distance company Sprint. The deal would rank as the largest corporate combination ever, but enthusiasm was dimmed by comments by an official at the Federal Communications Commission who cast some doubt on its chances of approval. Shares of both companies traded lower with MCI/ Worldcom down more than 5 per cent at $67 15/16 while Sprint fell back $1/8 to $59 7/8. Investors also saw fit to unload shares in Sprint PCS Group, the company's tracking stock, which tumbled more than 7 per cent to $73 1/8. BellSouth, the group that launched a late bid for Sprint over the weekend, was down as well, falling $11/16 to $41 3/4. In another merger, shares of TV Guide, which on Monday said it would merge with interactive television technology developer Gemstar International, fell $1 3/16 to $44 3/4 after PaineWebber cut its rating to ""attractive"" from ""buy"". Among Dow stocks, financial services company American Express gained $4 3/8 to $141 15/16 after the company said it would redevelop its online brokerage operation. AT&T was also strong, gaining $1 1/8 to $44 3/4. Shares of toy producer Mattel rallied, adding 10 per cent to $12 15/16, recovering some of the ground lost after a near 30 per cent fall on Monday. Semiconductor-related shares also rallied. Micron Technology soared more than 6 per cent to $78 after analysts at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown and Gruntal raised their earnings estimates. TORONTO edged lower in early trading as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Trading volumes were thin and at noon the 300 composite index was off 28.30 at 7,014.00. Banks pushed ahead. Royal Bank of Canada added 20 cents at C$61.15 and Bank of Montreal gained 60 cents at C$52.25. Canadian Imperial rose C$1.10 at C$29.55. In spite of another upbeat day for the bullion price which pressed close to a two-year high at the London fix, golds showed a mixed trend. Among leading producers, Barrick shed 25 cents to C$35.00 on profit-taking. Placer Dome hardened 20 cents to C$24.50. In telecoms, BCE improved 50 cents to C$75.15 while Nortel Networks gave up C$1.30 at C$77.80. Newbridge Networks came off 20 cents at C$37.30. Alcan Aluminium rose 30 cents to C$46.40.

493,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Roll call of voting fuels Fed drive to openness.,"Yesterday's statement by the Federal Reserve announcing its decision to keep interest rates unchanged while adopting a more neutral stance on future action was pretty typical as far as these statements go, except for a strange new addition: a roll call listing who voted for and against the decision. It might have marked a small step toward greater transparency, a move by Alan Greenspan to amass more power as Fed chairman, neither or both. The Fed usually waits until the second day after the subsequent FOMC meeting before releasing the vote tally from its latest meeting. But in a break with tradition the Fed immediately announced yesterday how all 10 members of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee voted, instead of waiting until May 9, two days after the next scheduled meeting. The measure is seen as the latest in a succession in recent years to improve the transparency of central bank decision-making. Economists were generally pleased. ""The Fed has become more transparent since the early 1990s - they didn't used to make public pronouncements, they used to release FOMC minutes much later and they never released full transcripts, and now we get them with a five-year delay - so this represents another move in that direction,"" said Joseph Lavorgna, senior economist with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. An internal analysis published last year by the Fed does suggest the central bank has become more open during Mr Greenspan's tenure - or at least easier to decipher. It cites statistical evidence showing financial markets had become much better at anticipating policy changes from 1994-2000 compared with 1989-1994. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said the central bank faces trade-offs in becoming ever-more transparent. In a speech last October to central bankers and economists in St. Louis, the Fed chairman sought to address occasional criticism that the Fed is too secretive. That secrecy is said to exacerbate financial market volatility and inefficiency and put the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility at unnecessary long-term risk. Mr Greenspan said that duty to become more transparent, and thus more accountable, sometimes conflicted with the Fed's other responsibility: to make good decisions. He said deliberations would be less free-flowing and fruitful if members knew remarks would immediately be made public. Mr Greenspan's past hesitation helped spawn some conspiracy theories about the release of the roll call yesterday. One former senior Fed official, who asked not to be named, called it a power grab by Mr Greenspan intended to stifle dissent from members wishing to avoid media scrutiny. ""The announcement effectively gives more power to the chairman because you don't want to look like a dissenter,"" said one observer.

494,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - US rates unchanged as risks diminish FEDERAL RESERVE ECONOMY EXPANDING.,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday but said for the first time in more than a year it no longer saw US economic risks as skewed towards further weakness. The US central bank's policymaking open market committee left its key overnight interest rate - the target for the federal funds rate - unchanged at 1.75 per cent. But for the first time since November 2000, the FOMC shifted its ""tilt"" of monetary policy - the assessment of the balance of risks between inflation and recession. It said policymakers now believed the risks were evenly balanced. The committee said: ""The information that has become available since the last meeting indicates that the economy, bolstered by a marked swing in inventory investment, is expanding at a significant pace. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" Financial market attention immediately shifted to the question of when the Fed will start raising interest rates. Recent statistics suggest the economy is in the early stages of what looks increasingly like a robust recovery from the most fleeting of recessions last year. Futures markets expect the Fed funds rate to rise by at least 100 basis points in the course of this year, with the first increase coming perhaps as soon as the Fed's next meeting in May. Consumer spending rose in January and in the same month businesses ended the rundown in inventories that was a key factor in the downturn. In February, the economy recorded the first increase in industrial production in nearly two years and the first rise in employment since last summer. But the Fed faces a tricky task of steering monetary policy back to normality after it cut interest rates throughout last year more aggressively than at any time in the last 20 years. If a firm recovery is indeed under way, short-term interest rates will need to rise from the current emergency levels. Most economists estimate that a neutral level for the federal funds rate - meaning one that is neither stimulative nor restrictive - is around 3 to 4 per cent at current rates of inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues have expressed concern about the likely tempo of the recovery. Few economists inside or outside the Fed believe growth in the current quarter, which could turn out as high as 5 per cent at an annualised rate, will be sustained through the rest of the year. * The US trade gap widened in January at the fastest pace in nearly three years as the US rapidly emerged from recession with a renewed appetite for imports, Peronet Despeignes adds. The Commerce Department said yesterday the monthly trade deficit grew by 15.4 per cent in January - the biggest increase since February 1999 - to $28.5bn ( #20bn). Exports dipped slightly, but imports jumped at the second fastest pace since the economic slowdown began in March 2000. The apparent resumption of the import binge is good news for a number of countries, particularly in Asia, which are heavily reliant on exports to the US, but it has revived concerns about the threat the deficit poses to the US economy and trade relations. "
495,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries rise as Fed sits tight.,"US Treasuries were mostly higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left the funds rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent but said that future risks ""are balanced"" The bond market had been expecting the Fed to change its balance of risks assessment to neutral, given positive data in recent weeks suggesting a rebounding economy. Previously the Fed had said risks were titled towards weakness. The Fed said that the economy is expanding ""at a significant pace"" although it warned that the degree of strengthening in final demand ""is still uncertain."" Treasuries fell early yesterday but after the FOMC meeting the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 96 3/4 with a yield of 5.296 per cent and the 30-year bond had risen 3/16 to 95 1/16 to yield 5.718 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 98 29/32 with a yield of 3.585 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat as investors showed little reaction to another rise in the ZEW index, a measure of German economic sentiment, which improved for the fifth consecutive month in February. Instead, bond investors were waiting for the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting to provide further confirmation of the strength of the US economic recovery. The two-year German schatz yield was down half a basis point to 4.249 per cent, while the yield on the 10-year German bund yield was also slightly lower at 5.199 per cent. The 10-year German bund futures price was up 0.05 to 105.22. Nervous trading ahead of the FOMC meeting sent UK gilts down, with the 10-year note yielding 5.252 per cent, just short of one basis point higher than Monday. Japanese government bonds were little changed as traders were reluctant to send the yield down too low ahead of today's 10-year cash JGB auction. The Ministry of Finance will auction Y1,800bn worth of 10-year JGBs today and investors are looking for a 1.5 per cent coupon, dealers said. Bonds may be supported by fresh money after the new financial year begins on April 1. Gains may be capped, however, because of this year's increased bond issuance and a lingering concern that Moody's could downgrade Japan's sovereign debt. The key June 10-year JGB futures contract slipped 0.05 to 137.64; the benchmark No 237 10-year cash JGB edged up 0.043 to 100.524, pushing the yield down 0.20 to 1.44. "
496,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed keeps rates level as economic risks lessen.,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday but signalled there was a growing possibility that rates would rise later in the year. The central bank's open market committee left its key overnight interest rate, the target for the federal funds rate, unchanged at 1.75 per cent. But for the first time since November 2000, the FOMC shifted its assessment of the balance of risks between inflation and recession, saying they were now evenly balanced - a hint that the Fed is moving closer to raising rates. After its meeting the FOMC said: ""Information ... indicates that the economy ... is expanding at a significant pace. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening ... an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" The decision had been anticipated and US stocks were little changed. Market attention shifted to the question of when the Fed will start raising rates.

If a firm recovery is under way, short-term interest rates will need to rise from the present emergency levels. Most economists estimate that a neutral level for the federal funds rate - one that is neither stimulative nor restrictive - is close to 4 per cent at current rates of inflation. In announcing its decision on Tuesday the Fed for the first time also published how each FOMC member voted. Previously, Fed-watchers had to wait for publication of the minutes, six to eight weeks after the meeting, to find out who supported or opposed the move. Tuesday's statement said all 10 members of the committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged. "
497,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,WORLD NEWS - THE AMERICAS - Fed seeks to enforce the speed limit - US RAISES INTEREST RATES.,"The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates yesterday underlined the difficulty the central bank faces in operating monetary policy in the highly unusual conditions that characterise the US economy in the late 1990s. The traditional rules that governed the economy for much of the past 25 years seem to have broken down, complicating the Fed's task of setting a properly pre-emptive policy to guard against the risks of inflation. The problem is that, as Fed officials, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, have repeatedly acknowledged, the old ""speed limit"", the maximum growth rate consistent with stable inflation, seems to have been raised in the past few years. Significant productivity improvements stemming from substantial investments in information technology have raised the productivity of US workers in the past four years. Underlining the importance of these changes, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration shared the Fed's goals of maintaining healthy growth with low inflation. ""Supported by sound economic policies, including budget discipline, the economy continues to grow, with strong investment and higher productivity, creating good jobs and improved living standards for all Americans."" But while almost everyone now agrees that the old sustainable growth rate of 2.5 per cent per year no longer obtains, few have a very good idea of what the new speed limit might be. The US economy will grow by about 4 per cent this year - and, if one thing seems to be clear, it is that the Fed thinks this pace is too fast. In the statement accompanying the quarter-point increase in both the Fed funds target rate and the discount rate, the Federal Open Market Committee said the action was taken to reduce that pace. ""Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential."" That, together with Fed economic forecasts published earlier this year, suggests the central bank's policymakers believe the new sustainable growth rate is somewhere between 3 and 4 per cent. But that provides a wide margin of potential error. If growth cannot in fact be sustained above 3 per cent, inflation will take off. If, by any chance, it can be sustained at 4 per cent, then the Fed may be pressing too hard on the monetary brake. The real difficulty arises from the fact that, even at the current 4 per cent rate, there are no signs of inflationary pressure. Though most Fed economists and officials believe this is probably the result of some benign short-term factors temporarily restraining inflation, no-one can be sure. And, as Mr Greenspan himself acknowledged in a speech last month, it is possible that the improvements in productivity in the past few years may be substantially better even than economists currently think. He raised the possibility that productivity growth could be rising so rapidly that the economy's sustainable growth rate might be even higher than 4 per cent. Few but the most wild-eyed optimists believe the current rate of growth is in fact sustainable. Most are prepared to bet that the Fed's general hunch that the new sustainable rate of between 3 and 4 per cent per year is broadly right. Further, most economists accept that the central bank's three rate increases of a combined 0.75 percentage points should slow the economy by the desired amount in the coming months. That explains why financial markets reacted so positively to the Fed's move yesterday. But the usual statistical fog is especially murky when the economy is undergoing significant change. And until that fog starts to clear, it remains unclear what the Fed will need to do to keep the economy on track. OECD urges higher rates, Page 18. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

498,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Profit-taking takes toll on Tokyo.,"Profit-taking was the dominant factor in TOKYO yesterday where investors eager to cash in on the market's recent rise took the Nikkei average lower for the fourth day running, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Selling activity focused on information and telecommunications issues, which have risen strongly in recent trading. However, the overall correction was moderate, suggesting to analysts that the market will soon return to support these sectors. The benchmark Nikkei average declined 42.95 to 18,155.14 after moving between 18,090.92 and 18,289.41. The Topix index of all listed shares declined 8.77 to 1,580.39. The Nikkei-300 fell 0.42 to 304.30. In spite of the overall decline in the indices, gaining issues outnumbered decliners 657 to 583. Volume was lower at 642.99m against 685.92m. The US Federal open market committee meeting, which was scheduled for later in the day, prompted caution as investors were divided over whether the FOMC would raise rates. The positive view was that Wall Street could welcome an interest rate rise in the US, triggering further rises in Tokyo as well. In the meantime, investors chose to take profits. Telecoms issues were roundly sold with DDI leading the pack. DDI, which unveiled disappointing results on Monday, was the largest loser in percentage terms. Its shares fell 13 per cent to Y1.27m. KDD also lost more than 12 per cent to Y11,800, while the NTT group of companies fell for the first time in days. NTT declined Y40,000 to Y1.84m, NTT DoCoMo Y160,000 to Y2.92m and NTT Data Y120,000 to Y2.41m. High-tech exporters fared better. Sony rose Y40 to Y18,800 after climbing to a record 19,100 earlier. Toshiba rose Y11 to Y670 and NEC gained Y5 to Y2,390. SEOUL rose sharply after rumours of an upgrade of the country's credit rating by Moody's sparked late buying. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 32.99 to 1,007.72, with interest focusing on blue chips and telecom shares. The Moody's delegation visited South Korea earlier this month to review the country's banking sector and sovereign risk. BANGKOK pared early losses to close with the SET index down 3.55 at 423.15 after a low for the session of 416.74. Bank shares ended firmer with the sector index up 0.3 per cent, but there were a number of exceptions to this trend. Bangkok Bank lost Bt1.00 at Bt56 on renewed concerns about a possible share issue. Sansiri, the property group, added Bt0.25 at Bt12.50 after reporting a return to profit. KUALA LUMPUR ceded ground, pulled lower by foreign selling of blue-chip stocks. The Kuala Lumpur Composite index was down 8.95 to 720.34. Volume was a thin 99.7m, with traders reluctant to take fresh positions ahead of November's general election. Concern that US interest rates might be raised after the close of trading also put downward pressure on larger company stocks. Gaming stocks, which had been riding high in previous sessions, were among the biggest losers. Berjaya Sports Toto fell 50 cents to MDollars 7.35. Magnum also lost ground, falling 6 cents to MDollars 2.81. HONG KONG was higher as investors sought out laggards and stocks likeliest to gain from Chinese membership of the World Trade Organisation. The Hang Seng index finished 127.24 higher at 14,689.46, a second consecutive two-year high. Turnover was an impressive HKDollars 17.4bn. Hutchison Whampoa was in demand, helped by recent telecom deals and its WTO-linked potential because of its Hong Kong and China port assets. The company was also seen as a strong contender to be the first non-Chinese telecom entity to gain entry to China. The shares put on HKDollars 2.75 to a high for the year of HKDollars 91.50. Recently underperforming property stocks were also sought. Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HKDollars 2.25 or 3.2 per cent at HKDollars 72, extending its rise since the end of October to 14.7 per cent. SHANGHAI and SHENZHEN edged lower as a brief wave of euphoria over the Sino-US agreement on China's bid to join the WTO quickly gave way to caution. Shanghai's hard-currency B shares eased 0.080 to 41.123 while their Shenzhen counterparts lost 0.70 to 85.89 as investors dumped motor and telecommunications issues.

Mannesmann stayed firm, adding Euros 4.67 at Euros 207.65 in spite of legal moves by the group to block a planned takeover attempt by Vodafone AirTouch of the UK. The shares have risen almost 36 per cent in seven sessions. There was initial disappointment at Bayer's third-quarter results statement, but the stock ended firmer following assurances about trading next year plus news of a $2.45bn US acquisition. Bayer ended Euros 1.19 higher at Euros 40.84 after touching a low of Euros 39.16 in early trading. BASF gained Euros 1.99 at Euros 43.60.

France Telecom fell after ABN Amro lowered its 1999 earnings per share forecast, citing disappointment over non-core businesses. France Telecom, considered a possible bidder for Orange in the event of a takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone AirTouch, was also weakened by the steep fall in Vodafone shares. France Telecom shares closed down Euros 1.90 to Euros 100.90. Overall, however, gainers led losers 20 to 16. Energy and transport group Alstom fell Euros 1.20 or 4.4 per cent to Euros 25.90.

Telecoms network group Versatel jumped Euros 1.90 or 10 per cent at Euros 21. ZURICH was on hold, with traders split on the likely outcome of the FOMC meeting and the SMI index ended with a rise of just 3.4 at 7,419.2. Life sciences group Novartis continued to give ground after the recent run-up on merger speculation. The company said that an e-mail to at least one Swiss bank, purporting to announce that the group was bidding for Monsanto, was a hoax. Roche certificates, again benefiting from switching within the sector, put on SFr80 to SFr18,710. Food and beverages group Nestle, hit in the wake of Unilever's weak performance figures, put on SFr22 to SFr2,900. Some switching was reported out of the Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group. MADRID pushed to its highest closing level of the year. The all-share general index ended up 5.33 at 937.19. Banco Santander Hispano Central, the biggest bank, was up 16 cents to Euros 11.10. Telcoms group Telefonica recovered from early losses. Disappointment over nine-month profits, which fell slightly below analysts' expectations, sent the shares lower but they rebounded to end 5 cents up to Euros 17.85. MILAN saw a subdued performance by internet and utility stocks, but solid gains elsewhere in Europe and on Wall St helped lift the broad market. The Mibtel index finished 82 higher at 23,935. Banco di Napoli saw volatile trade after a hint from the Sanpaulo chief executive that he would prefer to gain control of the Naples bank through a partial spin-off from Ina, rather than launching a takeover bid. Napoli finished 3.2 per cent higher at Euros 1.28 while Sanpaulo lost 1.6 per cent at Euros 12.28. Olivetti jumped 2.1 per cent to Euros 4.10 as Dresdner Kleinwort Benson resumed coverage of the stock with a buy recommendation. But trade remained cautious ahead of the unveiling of the financial terms of the Telecom Italia restructuring plan. STOCKHOLM forged to another life-time high, powered by a late rally in telecoms giant Ericsson. The general share index rose 47.55 to 4,485.95. Ericsson traded up SKr5.50 at SKr384. Celsius rose SKr36 to SKr172.50 after an agreed bid by rival Swedish defence group Saab. Written and edited by Jeffrey Brown, Christopher Swann and Peter Hall. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

501,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Issuers wait for Fed outcome.,"The primary market almost ground to a halt yesterday as potential issuers awaited the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. General sentiment was firm, however, with swap spreads little changed and underlying government bond prices remaining strong. In one of few significant deals, International Business Machines launched a $300m five-year bond via Japan's Daiwa Securities. The offer was targeted at Japanese retail investors and aimed at capturing a flood of cash from redemptions falling due in November and December. Many corporate borrowers have chosen to fulfil most of their funding requirements earlier in the year due to the potential impact of the millennium bug on prices in December. According to Lehman Brothers, there will be unusually large volumes of redemptions in sterling-denominated bonds - about #3.6bn of eurobonds will be redeemed in December alone, compared with an average monthly total of about #1.5bn. Coupled with the increasing scarcity of gilt supply, as the UK government keeps a cap on issuance amid a budget surplus, corporate sterling-denominated paper should become increasingly popular towards the end of the year.

502,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries fall on rate rise.,"US Treasuries fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised its Federal Fund rate 25 basis points and returned its bias to neutral. In midday trade on Wall Street, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 1/8 to 101 3/16, pushing its yield up to 6.038 per cent. Similarly, the 10-year note fell 5/32 to yield 5.943 per cent, while the two-year note lost 1/8 to yield 5.839 per cent. No further adjustments are expected until the Open Market Committee February meeting at the earliest. However, analysts warned that the central bank would remain vigilant about the US economy's continued growth. ""The Fed's going to focus on growth,"" said Jeffrey Palma, economist at Warburg Dillon Read. ""If the economy continues to charge ahead, they're going to be willing to knock it down."" The market had closely debated Fed policy since the FOMC left rates unchanged but adopted a tightening bias at its October 5 meeting. The US economy has continued to grow robustly since then, leaving unemployment at its lowest levels in nearly 30 years. However, tight labour markets have yet to generate much inflation. While Gross Domestic Product increased at a 4.8 per cent annual pace in the third quarter, for example, recent data show hourly wages have barely budged. The 25 basis point increase effectively reverses the three incremental rate cuts the Fed enacted last year to limit the drag on the US economy from the financial crises in Asia and Russia. Most had expected Treasuries to turn in a modest rally on the increase, viewing it as a pre-emptive strike. ""If they don't tighten now they will have to tighten early next year,"" said William Quan, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston before the decision, citing the tightness of the labour market and falling Treasury yields. The FOMC next meets in December, although no action is expected then because of concerns about the millennium changeover. European government bond prices were higher but the moves were exaggerated by the thin trading volumes. The German bund future close 0.62 higher at 108.20. Market observers said the activity was extremely subdued as most large investors waited for the decision from the FOMC. The European bond markets were also supported by the Germany's council of economic advisers cutting its forecast for German economic growth from 2 per cent to 1.4 per cent for 1999. In the UK, gilts were also higher, despite signs of higher inflation. The underlying rate of inflation which excludes mortgage interest payments rose by 2.2 per cent in the twelve months to the end of October, compared to 2.1 per cent in the previous month. Observers said this could spark new fears of the Bank of England raising interest rates, but would not alter the generally benign inflation outlook, highlighted yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The 10-year gilts future rose 0.5 to 111.04. In late trading the gilt future rose further to 111.30. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved. "
503,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,US AND CANADA - US central bankers reveal their bias.,"For years the ""policy bias"" of the Federal Reserve's open market committee has been one of those arcana of monetary policy-making that fail to break out of the more rarefied corners of public debate. Everybody knows that every six weeks or so the members of the policy-making body of the world's most powerful central bank decide at their meeting whether to raise or lower short-term interest rates. But until yesterday few people had heard much of the other policy decision the members routinely vote on - deciding the ""bias"" in the directive they give to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in conducting its market operations. That was because the decision was not announced publicly until the release of the minutes of the meeting - a day or two after the subsequent FOMC gathering, by which time it was stale news. Yesterday, however, the Fed's policy bias took its bold bow on the world's international economic stage, and with it the central bank inaugurated a new character in the drama of monetary policy-making. Announcing that the FOMC had decided not to raise interest rates, the Fed said for the first time that it had, however, decided to shift from a neutral to a ""tightening"" stance in its policy directive. In recent years the bias has had little or no practical significance. According to Fed insiders its primary purpose has been to maintain a solid consensus among the committee's 12 voting members. If, for example, a significant minority wanted to raise interest rates, while the rest wanted no change, the minority could usually be bought off by a change in the bias - towards tightening, in this case - maintaining the impressive near-unanimity of the committee. But by announcing the decision straight away the Fed has changed the function of the policy stance. And with a lengthy explanation of its move yesterday it made that function clear; it has become the latest weapon in the Fed's policy arsenal - less decisive than an interest rate change, but more emphatic than the often Delphic public ruminations of Alan Greenspan, the chairman. Yesterday's announcement was a warning to financial markets that, after months of tolerance of rapid growth and low unemployment, the Fed has not taken its eye off the inflation ball. It was the first change in the direction of the stance since autumn, when the central bank cut interest rates three times in rapid response to the crisis in international financial markets. The statement accompanying the announcement of the bias change was clear about the risks to the economy. ""Against the background of already-tight domestic labour markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognises the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation."" The explanation seemed to be that the shift in the bias marked a return to something approaching normality in policy-making. In any usual circumstances, a prolonged period of truly extraordinary growth and record low unemployment would have the Fed on full alert for inflation. But because of the global crisis of the last year, these have not been normal times. The reason the Fed had not already been on tightening alert was that global conditions were still volatile. With the shift back to near normality, for the central bank not to return to a cautious stance would have seemed almost reckless. As the statement put it, ""domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall"". But, as some economists pointed out, the Fed's move did not necessarily mean an interest rate increase was imminent. ""There have been many occasions in the past when the Fed has adopted a tightening stance and not tightened. It doesn't mean they will tighten this time,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. In fact, in the last three years the Fed has moved from a neutral to a tightening bias three times before yesterday. The first time interest rates were eventually raised, but not until a year after the adoption of the bias. The second time there was no increase and the bias returned to neutral a few months later. The third time the bias quickly reverted to neutral and rates were cut - three times - soon afterwards. This time few economists expect the Fed actually to increase rates until it has evidence of wage or price pressures. And the beauty of it is that if the central bank's new early warning system works, that may not be necessary. By more clearly signalling its mood to the markets, it may scare investors enough to achieve a de facto monetary tightening though higher bond yields and lower stock prices - a virtual monetary policy for the cyber age.

504,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,Fed signals concern over inflation.,"FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Fed signals concern over inflation - Central bank keeps US interest rates unchanged but hints at tighter policy. The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled its concern over rising inflationary pressures in the US economy by announcing a shift in its policy stance towards a greater readiness to raise interest rates. The US central bank's policymaking open market committee left short-term interest rates unchanged at its meeting yesterday but said its members had agreed to move to a ""bias"" towards tightening monetary policy. The move does not necessarily prefigure an increase in interest rates but indicates where the Fed's policymakers see the overall direction of the economy and the policy response that might be needed. ""While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential for a build-up of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favourable performance of the economy, and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy,"" the Fed said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed little changed at 10,836, down 16.52, on the news. Bond prices held mostly steady, following some sharp falls in recent weeks in anticipation of the change, although the price of the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell. It was the first time the Fed had chosen to make its policy bias public immediately after the committee meeting. In the past the stance had not been known until publication of the committee minutes, at least six weeks after the meeting. In a move aimed at improving transparency, the Fed said earlier this year it would begin announcing immediately changes in policy stance when it deemed it important for markets to know of the shift. The announcement came against a background of continuing strong growth in the US economy. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent in the six months to the end of March, and unemployment has fallen to 4.3 per cent, close to its lowest level in 30 years. Until yesterday's meeting, the Fed had not seemed unduly concerned about the inflationary risks of such rapid growth and tight labour markets. The central bank cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points last autumn in response to international financial turmoil, and since then the open market committee has maintained a neutral policy stance, indicating it felt the risks to the economy were evenly balanced between inflation and recession. But last week, in what some economists saw as an ominous sign that the long-feared inflationary upturn had arrived, the Commerce Department said consumer prices rose 0.7 per cent in April, the largest monthly leap in nine years. In some ways that figure was an aberration, apparently distorted by exceptional factors. There have been no other firm indications of meaningful inflationary pressures. But yesterday's decision indicates that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and most of his colleagues believe the balance of risks has shifted and inflation has become a significant threat again.

505,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Indices blow hot and cold ahead of rate decision.,"A confidence-boosting opening performance by Wall Street - ahead of the crucial meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee resurrected what looked like being another poor performance by London's equity market yesterday. Wall's Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 50 points as London closed. At the finish of an erratic trading session, the FTSE 100 was finally 40.6 ahead at 6,206.4, having swung in a 70-point arc that saw the index up almost 60 points at best before retreating equally quickly to post an 18.2 decline. Similarly, the broader FTSE All-Share index gave up good early gains and posted a minor fall over the lunchtime period, only to rally strongly later in the day to close a net 15.24 firmer at 2,887.91. The FTSE 250 index managed a minor 5.5 gain at 5,706.7, but the FTSE SmallCap was never able to shake off the effects of persistent selling pressure and ended 6.4 down at 2,556.9. ""Everything hinges on the outcome of the FOMC meeting. It's as simple as that,"" said one marketmaker, adding that a rate rise or an indication that the next move in US rates would be upwards, could open the way for more pressure to be put on Wall Street and global markets. Earlier, the market had kicked off in good heart, responding to Wall Street's late rally, which saw the Dow finish only 59 points off, having been down more than 150 points at worst, plus some encouraging domestic corporate and economic news. On the economic front, there was a warm welcome for the April consumer price index data, which showed headline inflation at 1.6 per cent year on year and core inflation dipping back below the government's 2.5 per cent target to show a 2.4 per cent increase year on year. Adding some spice to the day's events was the revelation that Allied Domecq has been the target of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which has accumulated a 2.2 per cent stake in the drinks group. Allied shares spiralled upwards, topping the FTSE 100 performance table with the market adopting the view that Mr Buffett would substantially increase his stake. And there was considerable relief with the news that Marks and Spencer's preliminary results revealed no unexpected horrors. Profits were down 42 per cent, but were no worse than expected. There was more good news for the sector from Next, the fashion group, which reported a big jump in sales. The news invigorated the rest of the stores area of the market and boosted the FTSE 250, which contains many retail companies such as Arcadia, Storehouse and Debenhams. A couple of takeover bids produced some spectacular gains in smaller companies. Crown Leisure almost doubled on the management buy-out, while Portsmouth &Sunderland Newspapers raced higher after an agreed bid from Johnston Press. Turnover in equities picked up strongly from Monday's 856.1m, reaching 1.1bn by 6pm. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
506,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unruffled by FOMC warning.,"The US dollar was initially unchanged yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned it was moving to a tightening bias. Following the announcement the dollar shot up against the yen but then surrendered its gains after a sell-off in US asset markets. ""The market has been slow to decide whether the prospect of higher interest rates will be dollar positive or not,"" said David Bloom, currency economist at HSBC. ""Ultimately the argument will turn on the response of the asset markets, where the initial reaction has been negative."" During the London session the dollar paced within a narrow range against other major currencies as the market awaited the decision. * The Israeli shekel firmed yesterday after the Labour party's electoral victory kindled hopes of progress in the middle east peace process. The shekel initially strengthened by just under one per cent against the dollar to Shk4.07. Analysts said the market's relatively guarded response reflected uncertainty ahead of the US rate decision. ""Part of the news had been priced in over the past few days,"" said Mike Wallace, manager of currency analysis at Standard and Poor's MMS. ""Caution about the prospect of a right-wing backlash and the difficulty of forging a coalition able to negotiate a deal with the Palestinians and Syria may have also played a part,"" he added. But most analysts believed the peace dividend expected under Ehud Barak, the new prime minister, would boost regional trade and re-start delayed investment projects. * A rating upgrade from Standard &Poors yesterday gave the Australian dollar a fresh turn of speed. David Beers, managing director of sovereign debt at the US credit rating agency, added to the optimism by saying that the upgrade of Australia's foreign currency rating from AA to AA+ did not preclude another step up. The Aussie burst up to $0.6720 on the news, recouping loses last week when uncertainty over the passing of the government's tax reforms cast the currency under a cloud. Analysts said the Aussie could meet resistence as it approached $0.6750, where some investors were said to be protecting positions. ""If this level is breached then technical factors could lift it up to $0.6820,"" said James McKay, global markets strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He added that the continuing sale of state assets, including the remaining stake in the telecom group Telstra, could further strengthen the ratings outlook for Australia. Merger and acquisition activity gave added impetus to the currency, with Telecom New Zealand emerging as a bidder for AAPT, the Australian telecom group. ""Telecom New Zealand have already bought close to 10 per cent of the Australian group and a successful bid should further stoke demand for the Aussie,"" said Chris Furness, head of currency analysis at economic consultancy 4Cast. * Malaysia moved yesterday to quash suggestions that it should revalue the ringgit. Daim Zainuddin, finance minster, said that although some analysts had argued for a M$3 per dollar level, the government was comfortable with the M$3.80 peg. Recent initiatives replacing some capital controls with a 10 per cent ""outflow tax"" raised expectations that Malaysia would take a more flexible approach to foreign exchange. But speaking to a group of fund managers, Mr Daim also dampened hopes of a further relaxation of capital controls in the near future. Analysts said the recent rally in the region's currencies left considerable scope for a rise in the ringgit. ""The currency is still about 52 per cent below its pre-crisis levels compared to 21 per cent below for the Singapore dollar,"" said Mr Wallace. However, Gene Frieda of economic consultancy 4Cast, argued that with the yen looking fragile the authorities were unlikely to judge this an ideal time to revalue.

507,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Fed sends Treasuries lower.,"The Federal Reserve's decision to change it bias towards interest rates, while keeping rates unchanged for now, led US bond prices to lose early gains. US Treasury prices were higher leading up to the announcement, but sold off quickly soon after, especially at the short-end. Morning prices had been helped by a new round of overseas buying, especially from Japan. In the hours prior to the announcement investors were less concerned about the threat of higher inflation and interest rates than in previous sessions, helped by the latest report on the US housing market. As a result the long bond yield dipped below 5.9 per cent. In the minutes after the Fed decision, the benchmark 30-year bond was just 1/32 higher at 91 3/32, yielding 5.887 per cent. Among short-term issues, the 10-year note was down 5/32 to 98 25/32, yielding 5.661 per cent. The two-year note yield rose to 5.358 per cent on a 1/8 fall in price. There had been little expectation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates but opinions were divided on whether the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee would move to a tightening bias, a decision that could have been revealed in a policy statement later in the day, or in the coming weeks. ""The two key engines of growth, housing and consumer spending, seem to be moderating,"" said Richard Gilhooly, at Paribas Capital Markets in New York. A morning economic report confirmed the trend. New house projects for the month of April were at their lowest level in nearly a year. European bond prices moved in line with US Treasuries. Dieter Wermuth at Tokai Bank in Frankfurt said euro-zone bonds had behaved as if they were part of the US economy. The 10-year German bund future closed 0.37 higher at 114.24. UK gilts continued to underperform euro-zone markets. The 10-year gilt future fell 0.14 to 114.14 and the 10-year yield spread between German bunds and UK gilts widened three basis points to 91 basis points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

508,2000-05-16,2000-05-17,Financial Times,Fed raises rates by half-point to damp US growth.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a new urgency in its attempts to damp the blazing American economy, raising short-term interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest level since the US emerged from recession in 1991. The Fed's policy-making open market committee lifted its key interest rate, the target for the fed funds rate at which it lends to the banking system, to 6.5 per cent. The central bank also raised its largely symbolic discount rate by half a point to 6 per cent. The move marked the abandonment of the gradualist approach to monetary policy that has been the Fed's hallmark for the past five years. It was the first time since early 1995 that interest rates have moved by other than a quarter of a percentage point. Explaining its decision, the FOMC repeated its now familiar concern that the rapid pace of demand growth was outstripping supply, and hinted that there might be more rate rises to come. ""Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."" Financial markets had anticipated the more aggressive tightening after a string of reports indicated the US economy was continuing to grow at breakneck speed and that long-subdued inflationary pressure may be on the rise. Bond and stock prices slipped a little after the announcement, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed 126.79 points higher at 10,934.57. Attention now shifts to the next Fed meeting at the end of June and to whether there will be any evidence to prevent another rate rise. The Fed has lifted short-term rates by 1.75 percentage points in the past year in an attempt to slow growth. In the last six months of last year, the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 6 per cent. That barely slowed in the first three months of 2000 to 5.4 per cent. In recent months there have been signs of inflationary pressures - notably a 4.3 per cent increase in employment costs in the year to March, and a 0.4 per cent leap in consumer prices excluding food and energy costs in March, one of the largest increases in the past five years. Some analysts think Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues will wait a while to see if their actions have been sufficient to slow growth. The lags associated with monetary policy changes mean clear evidence of a deceleration may not emerge until the second half of the year. In the past week some reports have suggested the inflation risk is less than previously thought. Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that seasonally adjusted consumer prices were unchanged in April. Excluding food and energy, prices rose by just 0.2 per cent. But the tone of yesterday's announcement suggests the Fed thinks it may need to do more. Editorial Comment, Page 22 Lex, Page 24 Bonds, Page 38 Currencies, Page 39.

509,2000-05-16,2000-05-17,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Floating rate deals take centre stage.,"Primary activity in the international bond market was light yesterday, as issuers and investors waited for the verdict on interest rates from the FOMC meeting. Bank issuers favouring floating rate deals were propelled to the fore. Portuguese state savings bank Caixa Geral de Depositos launched a five-year FRN deal worth $750m, and is expected to use the proceeds to refinance its acquisition of insurer Mundial Confianca. Euro-denominated issuance was confined to two floating-rate deals, from Germany's DG Hypothekenbank and Comptoir des Entrepreneurs of France. Proctor &Gamble priced a two-tranche Y65bn deal yesterday, launched on Monday, and its success illustrated the relative health of the yen market. A Y50bn 10-year tranche carries a 2 per cent coupon, and was priced at the tight end of the initial range to yield 30 basis points over JGBs. A Y15bn five-year tranche, an increase of a Y40bn deal from November last year, was priced to yield 26 basis points over JGBs. ""Compared to the dollar and the euro markets, the yen market still has pretty good conditions,"" said Denis Kelleher, a syndicate member at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International. ""There is plenty of demand for paper in Japan, but domestic issuance is low because companies are in the middle of the reporting season,"" he added. ""It is a good time to bring foreign issuers into the yen market, and will continue to be so into next week."" Argentina is poised to take advantage of the low cost of borrowing in the Japanese market, and has announced plans to launch several samurai issues. Officials in the Argentine ministry of finance have said that the sovereign will try to develop a larger retail and institutional investor base in Japan. Merrill Lynch and Nomura have been appointed joint lead managers for a yen issue, possibly later this month. While European corporate issues are scarce because of interest rate worries and volatile credit spreads, the number of companies preparing deals is mounting. The roadshow circuit is as busy as ever, but borrowers are waiting for signs of more benign market conditions before deciding to launch. Bankers predict a very busy period during June and July, as issuers try to get deals out of the way before the summer vacation season. Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, Rhodia, the French speciality chemicals company, and French property company Unibail are a few of the corporate borrowers putting the finishing touches to bond deals. The European high yield market is also very active, although the efforts of bankers and borrowers has yet to push through into a high volume of deals. UK bingo operator Gala Group is carrying out a roadshow across Europe, hoping to launch a #100m 10-year issue next week with lead manager CSFB. Gala is raising funds to partly refinance its leveraged buy-out by CSFB Private Equity. Weigh-tronix, a Dutch company that makes industrial and household scales, is marketing a Euros 135m 10-year issue with Lehman Brothers as lead manager. The funds will finance part of the company's acquisition of Avery Berkel from Marconi. Copyright Financial Times Limited 2000. All Rights Reserved. "
510,2006-10-25,2006-10-26,Financial Times,Fed news causes a stir GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasuries rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve gave what appeared to be a sanguine assessment of the inflation outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate unchanged at5.25 per cent. It said inflation was likely to moderate over time, adding only that ""some inflation risks remain"". The committee also said the economy ""seems likely to expand at a moderate pace"". ""The dovish statement reflects the recent correction in energy prices and investors are now focusing on confirmation of weak third quarter growth later this week,"" said Kevin Cronin, head of investmentsat Putnam Investments. Earlier, weak housing data threw support behind the view that growth is slowing. Existing homes sales in the US last month were weaker than expected. The yield on the two-year Treasury was down 5.4 basis points at 4.854 per cent in late trading in New York. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell 6bp to 4.767 per cent. A stronger US market helped stem falls in the eurozone government bond market. However, Bunds remained weaker in late trading, following strong regional economic news. A key indicator of German business sentiment, as measured by the Ifo research institute, was unexpectedly strong, and it fuelled concerns that interest rates in the eurozone would continue to rise. In late trading, the yield on the two-year Schatz was up 1.2bp to 3.745 per cent and the yield on the 10-year Bund was up 0.7bp to 3.887 per cent. UK gilts took their cue from the rest of Europe and prices were weaker, with the yield on the two-year gilt up 0.5bp to 5.087 per cent and the 10-year gilt yielding4.705 per cent, 0.8bp higher. Japanese government bonds fell in response to a weaker stock market. The yield on the 10-year was down 3bp to 1.800 per cent. Analysts said the bond market continued to benefit from mobile carrier Softbank's announcement on Monday that there was a ""price war"" beginning among Japan's telecoms carriers. This is because some investors think it could push inflation down. "
511,2006-10-25,2006-10-26,Financial Times,Data cheer Treasuries GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasuries made gains yesterday after weak housing data reinforced the view that growth in the world's largest economy was slowing and the Federal Reserve slightly softened its language about the inflation outlook.  Investors were relieved after the Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent, and said ""some inflation risks remain"".  ""The dovish statement reflects the recent correction in energy prices and investors are now focusing on confirmation of weak third quarter growth later this week,"" said Kevin Cronin, head of investments at Putnam Investments.  The housing data, for its part, threw support behind the view that growth is slowing. Existing homes sales in the US last month were weaker than expected.  This cheered US Treasuries, and the yield on the two-year Treasury was down4 basis points at 4.866 per cent by late trading in London. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell 5.2bp to 4.775 per cent.  A stronger US market helped stem price falls in the eurozone government bond market. However, Bunds remained weaker in late trading, following strong regional economic news.  A key indicator of German business sentiment, as measured by the Munich-based Ifo research institute, was unexpectedly strong, and it fuelled concerns that interest rates in the eurozone would continue to rise.

512,2006-10-25,2006-10-26,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed statement initiates dollar sell-off.,"The dollar extended its losses on Thursday after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep US interest rates on hold. The US central bank's decision to keep the main Fed funds rate at 5.25 per cent was not a surprise, but it was the accompanying statement that triggered the dollar sell-off. Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York, said investors led into long dollar positions by hawkish rhetoric from Federal Open Market Committee members in the run-up to its decision were disappointed that the statement merely echoed its previous policy stance and did not ratchet up inflationary fears. ""The dollar bulls have really thrown in the towel,"" said Mr Woolfolk. ""We are at a stage now when the market is trying to decide whether to turn negative on the dollar."" By mid-afternoon in New York, the dollar was 0.5 per cent lower against the euro at $1.2665, off 0.3 per cent against the yen at Y118.70 and 0.5 per cent weaker against the pound at $1.8870. Ashraf Laidi, chief FX analyst at CMC Markets, said that with the dollar falling against the euro for a third successive day - a pattern not seen since August - the question was whether the dollar was at a turning point. ""The current turnaround in the dollar is symptomatic of a major reassessment of monetary policy expectations, reinstating probabilities that the next rate move will be a cut, not a hike,"" he said. Mr Laidi said he expected the Fed to cut US rates either at its meeting in January or in March, and that experience showed the dollar would fall between 4 to 5 per cent in the run up to the move. He argued the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar were the currencies with the greatest potential to benefit, due to expectations of at least one more rate rise in Australia and his belief that oil prices would sustain their recent rally. ""Although the Bank of Canada has signalled the end of its tightening cycle, steady growth and a likely modest bounce in oil prices should help support the loonie,"" he said. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 per cent to a six-week high of $0.7620 against the dollar. However, the Canadian dollar dropped 0.4 per cent to C$1.1280 against the dollar after a business conditions survey showed Canadian industrial orders were at their lowest level since mid-2003. Meanwhile, the euro received support from a number of directions. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, sounded a hawkish tone on eurozone interest rates, saying inflation risks for 2007 remained on the upside and the ECB should remain vigilant for price pressures. Elsewhere, the GfK market research group said its German consumer sentiment index was set to hit its highest level in five years in November. Even Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, got in on the act, telling a conference in Washington that not only the private sector, but also central banks, were starting to switch from the dollar into the euro. The euro gained 0.2 per cent to Y150.26 against the yen and put on 0.1 per cent against sterling to GBP0.6715. The New Zealand dollar tumbled 1.1 per cent to $0.6545 against the dollar after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand left interest rates unchanged at 7.25 per cent after a policy meeting. Nick Bennenbroek, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said the fall was hardly a shock even if the RBNZ did not rule out further rises since the market was evenly divided as to whether it would raise rates or keep them on hold.""You would have got a sharp reaction whatever happened,"" he said. ""The central bank was bound to surprise half the market."" The Swedish krona fell after the country's central bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 per cent, but signalled any further tightening would be gradual. Traders had expected the Riksbank to signal a more cautious stance on inflation, given strength in the country's housing and labour markets. The krona fell 0.2 per cent against the euro to SKr9.2335.

Earnings warnings for several stocks were offset in part by upgrades for the likes of Intel and Cisco, which provided a boost for the technology sector.  Airline stocks were also higher after JPMorgan upgraded six airlines and said valuations were low given the outlook for consolidation in 2008.  KB Home After the Federal Open Market Committee statement was released, stocks rallied further and reached new highs for the day.  All 10 leading sectors in the S&P 500 index were in positive territory.  ""A Fed that describes the economy and inflation in friendlier terms than before is generally treated bullishly in the markets, particularly the stock market,"" saidTony Crescenzi, strategistat Miller Tabak &Co.  At mid-afternoon, the S&P was up 0.5 per cent at 1,513.47 points. While oil prices had risen above Dollars 70 a barrel yesterday, their highest level in 10 months, the energy sector was lagging behind broad market gains.  At mid-afternoon, theNasdaq Composite was leading the broad benchmarks with a rise of 0.7 per centto 2,623.40. Brokerage upgrades for Intel, up 1.5 per cent at Dollars 24.14, and Cisco Systems, up 3.4 per cent at Dollars 28.19, boosted technology stocks.  Also helping the sector was a 2.3 per cent rise to Dollars 28.59 in Dell. Amazon rose 2.2 per cent at Dollars 69.64, taking its gain for the year to 76.5 per cent.  RBC Capital Markets raised its price target for the online retailer from Dollars 45 to Dollars 75.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per centto 13,478.94.  Leading the blue chips was General Motors, up2.5 per cent to Dollars 38.36 with shares reaching their highest level in two years. The carmaker agreed to sell its Allison Transmission commercial and military business for about Dollars 5.6bn to the Carlyle Group and Onex Corp, two private equity firms.  The American stock exchange airline index was up 2.6 per cent, trimmingits loss for the year to13.6 per cent.

514,2007-06-28,2007-06-29,Financial Times,Fed holds steady and keeps focus on inflation.,"Oil prices rose to their highest in 10 months yesterday while global stocks were mainly firmer and bonds came under pressure as the Federal Reserve signalled a continued focus on inflation.  In the currency markets, the yen went into reverse after three days of gains as a rally in global equity markets eased investor concerns over risky assets and triggered renewed appetite for carry trades.  Investors were largely on the sidelines early yesterday as they awaited the Federal Open Market Committee meeting's decision.  As expected, the FOMC left the overnight interest rate of 5.25 per cent unchanged, marking a full year of steady Fed policy.  Economists had expected the FOMC to remain vigilant about inflation risk, a stance that would keep the chances of a rate cut later this year below 50 per cent.  The FOMC delivered on that forecast when policy makers said: ""A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBS Capital Markets, said: ""The Fed noted the improvement in core inflation, but remained unconvinced that inflation pressures would moderate on a sustained basis.""  As concerns over how troubles in the US mortgage market would ultimately play out across structured credit markets lingered, investors were reminded yesterday that inflation potentially remained an issue.  Money supply in Germany rose more than expected yesterday, while revised first quarter growth in the US was accompanied by an upward revision in core inflation measures.  In commodities, US crude oil futures moved above Dollars 70 a barrel for the first time since the start of September amid supply concerns. High energy prices raise the risk that consumer spending could slow down over the summer, and could also feed into higher core inflation later this year.  Although US first quarter growth in gross domestic product was revised up to0.7 per from a previously reported 0.6 per cent, the main talking point was the price index for personal consumption. The core PCE, excluding food and energy, rose an annualised 2.4 per cent, above a previous estimate of a 2.2 per cent gain for the quarter.  The rise increases the likelihood that the May core PCE reading for the past year, due today, will remain above the Fed's preferred ceiling of 2 per cent.  Economists at Bear Stearns said the revision could entail a significant reduction in ""the chances that May's core PCE inflation rate slips to 1.9 per cent"".  At mid-afternoon, stocks on Wall Street had rallied further. The S&P 500 index was up 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher amid upgrades for bellwether stocks such as Amazon and Cisco. European stocks were broadly higher before Wall Street opened and largely held those gains. In London the FTSE 100 index closed up 0.7 per cent at 6,571.30 points. The Eurofirst 300 index ended the day 1.03 per cent higher at 1,595.82.  In Asia, stocks mainly rallied, with Hong Kong rising 1.1 per cent to 21,938.22, just shy of its recent record close.  Singapore was up 0.9 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 per cent. The volatile Shanghai Composite fell 4 per cent.  Global bond yields were generally higher yesterday, with the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond up 5 basis points at 1.91per cent.  The yield on the German 10-year Bund was up 2bp at 4.56 per cent. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was 2bp higher at 5.10 per cent, and the market weakened after the FOMC statement was released. The policy-sensitive two-year note fell sharply in price, with its yield rising 6bp to 4.94 per cent. While traders said the US bond market stayed in a range, the risk of renewed haven buying could no be ruled out.  ""We remain worried that credit perceptions may race ahead of reality and force a longer term pendulum swing away from risk-seeking and toward risk conservatism,"" said William O'Donnell, strategist at UBS. In the currency markets, the dollar was little changed. The yen was more volatile. Against the high-yielding New Zealand dollar, a favourite target of carry trade investors, the yen tumbled 1.5 per cent to Y94.50.  "

The two main talking points were the risks of wider financial stress from exposure to US subprime mortgages and worries that a recent decline in US core inflation pressures may prove fleeting. Against this backdrop, risk appetite as measured by the yen carry trade, equity market volatility, government bonds and credit spreads fluctuated over the course of the week. These barometers continued to reflect investor angst on Friday.  Although problems at two Bear Stearns hedge funds that own collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) based on subprime mortgage debt appear contained, investors fretted that this could reflect an impending credit crunch.

The CDX index of US investment-grade credit derivatives was at 40.75 basis point on Friday, out from 40 basis at the close of business last week.  In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.4 per cent higher after five volatile sessions to 1,605.33, dominated by the banking sector, as investors became cautious over the potential exposure of European investment banks to the subprime debacle.

517,2007-06-28,2007-06-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Cure US inflation falls below 2%.,"Core inflation fell below 2 per cent for the first time in three years after a modest increase in prices last month, according to new government figures.  A key index of consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy, climbed only 0.1 per cent in May, which brought the rate for 12 months to 1.9 per cent. High petrol prices drove the headline rate up 0.5 per cent.  The slowdown in core inflation will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which on Thursday left interest rates unchanged and kept a resolute focus on risks of future inflation.  In its statement at its June policy meeting, which kept rates at 5.25 per cent, the Fed dropped its description of core inflation as ""somewhat elevated"" and acknowledged that ""readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months"".  But it warned that ""a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  Gary Bigg, economist at Bank of America, said of the Federal open market committee: ""The FOMC should be quite pleased with recent inflation developments.""  Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said the economy was ""evolving as the Fed expected"" with inflation easing and growth projections also being reined in.  The report from the commerce department on Friday also showed consumer spending and income lower than expected in May.  Personal income increased 0.4 per cent. Consumption spending increased 0.5 per cent for the second consecutive month.  ""The slender gain in income will restrain consumption spending,"" said Gary Bigg, economist at Bank of America. ""Income and spending gains were weaker than expected, suggesting that spending for the quarter will be soft.""  Economists said higher fuel prices explained much of the spending increase.  Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight, said: ""Although consumer spending rose by what looks like a robust 0.5 per cent in May, more than half of the increase in spending went into gasoline tanks as consumers were hit by higher gasoline prices.""  ""Spending should improve in the second half of the year, with gasoline prices easing back, but not back to the runaway first-quarter pace, as the downturn in the housing market will weigh on consumers,"" he said.

Both the Dow and the S&P reached record closes early in June, and sentiment has been dented on a number of fronts.  ""Through June equity investor worries have ranged from inflation angst to an unwinding of expectations that the Fed will ease in 2007 to outright fear that the LBO [leveraged buyout] spigot will dry up, among many others,"" said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. ""But it all began with a spike in the 10-year bond yield, which continues to be symbolic of investor fears if not a cause of them.""

The ABX index, a credit derivative benchmark that tracks US subprime mortgage bonds fell to a new low on Thursday  ""The recent regulatory pressures have made accurate markets in the subprime/credit markets of significance, so we expect focus to return to the ABX/credit space as the week winds down,"" said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  Among the major sectors in the S&P, the energy sector has risen 13.7 per cent in the second quarter and remains the leading industry group this year with a gain of 15.7 per cent.  Information technology gained ground in the second quarter with a rally of 10.55 per cent, and is up 9.3 per cent in 2007.  As bond yields rose in recent months, the utility sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.5 per cent during the second quarter. It is the only S&P sector to record a negative return for the three months since the start of April.  For the year so far, financials are the only major sector to be in negative territory, down 1.3 per cent. During the second quarter, financials have risen 2.3 per cent.  Consumer discretionary and staples sectors are both under 5 per cent higher for the year to date. Analysts say the sectors have been hurt by higher interest rates, and oil prices, and the rise in non core inflation.  On Thursday, the S&P closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,505.71 points, after it rose to a high of 1,514.84 after the FOMC statement was released. Financials, utility and energy sectors closed lower. Nasdaq Composite led the broad benchmarks during the day and closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,608.37.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4 per cent lower at 13,422.28.  "
520,2009-09-23,2009-09-24,Financial Times,Dollar and equities volatile after Fed meeting,"global overview US interest rates are left on hold Oil prices tumble by nearly 4% US stocks and the dollar were volatile yesterday after the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, with a big drop in oil prices hitting equity market sentiment. The dollar, briefly dropped to its lowest level on a trade-weighted index after the FOMC meeting, only to claw back those losses as oil prices tumbled nearly 4 per cent and sank equities. The US central bank left interest rates on hold and pledged to keep them at record lows for an ""extended period"". The Fed also said that it would slow the pace of its purchases of mortgage-backed securities, ending the $1,500bn programme three months later than scheduled. It added that the economy was recovering after a ""severe downturn"", although it warned that household spending, while apparently stabilising, remained constrained by, among other factors, continuing job losses and sluggish income growth. Late in New York, the S&P 500 closed 1 per cent lower, after rising 0.8 per cent in the wake of the FOMC statement. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 4 basis points lower at 3.41 per cent. Yields had earlier risen after a disappointing auction of five-year paper. Central bank exit strategies were in focus elsewhere after the release of the minutes from the Bank of England's meeting this month . The Bank of England's monetary policy committee noted the recent improvements in economic and financial data as it voted unanimously to keep the asset purchase programme at £175bn in September. However, the door was left open for further easing, with the minutes also saying that for ""those members who had preferred a larger stimulus at the August meeting, a larger asset purchase programme could still be justified"". Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the minutes had validated the view that an increase in the quantitative easing limit was still possible. ""With two [MPC] members [Mervyn King, governor, and David Miles] continuing to see a case for more aggressive action, a further 'upping of the QE ante' come November remains a clear possibility,"" he said. Mr McGuire added: ""Notable by its absence, meanwhile, was any discussion on a possible reduction of the deposit rate. One might surmise that such action will remain on the back burner until the Bank is satisfied it has done as much as is necessary in terms of pumping liquidity into the system."" On the currency markets , news of the unanimous vote pushed sterling higher against both the euro and the dollar. The Norwegian krone enjoyed even bigger gains after Norges Bank left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 1.25 per cent. ""A rate hike in October looks very likely,"" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. The euro rose to a fresh one-year peak of $1.4844, only to slip below $1.48 late in New York. European government bonds were mixed. The 10-year Bund yield rose 1bp to 3.38 per cent after an issue of five-year German debt attracted reasonable demand. UK Gilts rose after the release of the Bank minutes, with the two-year yield down 2bp at 0.85 per cent. European equities edged higher, with the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rising 0.2 per cent. The mood in Asia was subdued as Japanese markets were closed for a third day. Hong Kong fell 0.5 per cent while Shanghai fell to three-week closing low. In commodities , the oil price fell below $69 a barrel after US data showed an unexpectedly large rise in domestic crude and refined product inventories last week. Nymex November WTI was down $2.79 at $68.97. Copper also fell on news of rising inventories and faltering demand from China. The Baltic Dry index, a gauge of shipping costs for commodities, fell for a ninth session. Analysts said the slide partly reflected an increase in shipping capacity, but also signalled that demand for commodities was starting to wane. Gold edged lower to $1,012 an ounce as the dollar stabilised."
521,2009-09-23,2009-09-24,Financial Times,Fed eyes money market fund link to beat inflation,"The Federal Reserve is looking to team up with the moneymarket mutual fund industry as part of its strategy to ensure that its unconventional policies to stimulate the economy do not produce a bout of post-crisis inflation. The central bank envisages eventually draining liquidity from the financial system by engaging in trades called ""reverse repos"" with the deep-pocketed money-market funds. In these, the Fed would pledge mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries acquired during the crisis as collateral for short-term loans from the funds. The discussions about the strategy form part of a Fed effort to ensure it will be in a position to raise interest rates when it decides the moment is right - even though most officials believe it is still many months away from having to do so. The US central bank yesterday said it would complete its planned $1,450bn purchases of securities and debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a reduced pace, allowing it to stretch out the buying to March 2010. In its policy statement, issued after a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated it is slowly retiring some of the tools used to fight the crisis. The Fed said it would ""continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote recovery"" rather than ""all available tools"" in past months. However, the central bank reiterated it expects to keep interest rates near zero for an ""extended period"". The Fed said activity has ""picked up"" and noted signs of a rebound in activity in the housing market. But policymakers still appeared very unsure about the prospects for household spending - which they said ""seems to be stabilising, but remains constrained"". Nonetheless, the Fed signalled it does not expect a double-dip recession, looking instead to a ""strengthening of economic growth"". Most policymakers presently ancitipate that the first rate hike will not come before the second half of 2010. However, the Fed wants to establish the mechanisms for doing this well in advance, which is why it is exploring the idea of transactions with money funds now. In the course of the crisis, the Fed created roughly $800bn of additional bank reserves to finance asset purchases and loans. This total is likely to rise in the coming months as the central bank completes its asset purchases and the Treasury unwinds financing it provided to the Fed. Fed officials think they could raise interest rates even with this excess supply of reserves by offering to pay banks to deposit their surplus funds with it rather than lend them out. However, they also want to use reverse repos in tandem to soak up some of the excess reserves - policymakers call this a ""belt and braces approach"". The obvious counterparties for reverse repo deals are the Wall Street primary dealers. However, the Fed thinks they would only have balance sheet capacity to refinance about $100bn of assets. Hence the interest in dealing with money funds as well. The sector has $2,500bn in assets, which means it could plausibly refinance as much as $500bn in Fed assets. Officials think there would be appetite on the part of the funds, which are under pressure from regulators and investors to stick to low-risk liquid investments."
522,2009-09-23,2009-09-24,Financial Times (FT.Com),The Fed,"""Stop, children, what's that sound, everybody look what's going down"". The Kinks knew what was what back in 1966, and Ben Bernanke knows what is going down now. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee left the target interest rate near zero and told investors to expect it to remain low for some time yet. What is the Fed so worried about? What's going down are broader measures of money supply. Notes and coins, as well as deposit, savings and money market accounts, or M2, has been falling since the end of June, for example. That fall hardly seems possible given that the so-called monetary base (currency in circulation plus bank reserves) has more than doubled in the last year, almost entirely due to the Fed's emergency lending programmes. Bank reserves have exploded from $50bn to almost $850bn in 12 months. But the frightening reality is that bank lending is now contracting faster than the Fed is buying assets from the non-bank private sector, as part of its efforts to lower yields and revive failed markets. No matter how much the Fed seems to do, banks are not extending loans. US consumer credit, for example, fell at an annualised 10 per cent in July. Total debt outstanding is where it was a year ago. Some wonder about the wisdom of attempting to mend the wreckage of a debt-bubble with yet more debt. Even so, the economic consequences of shrivelling broad money do not bear thinking about - the long-term growth rate of M2, for example, is normally about 10 per cent per year. So forget about inflation. Goldman Sachs notes that inflation has the highest correlation to broader measures of money supply. Best ask for that pay rise now."
523,1997-11-12,1997-11-13,Financial Times,MARKET REPORT - FTSE 100.,"Nervousness after falls in Asian markets overnight, coupled with tension ahead of decisions from the FOMC meeting in the US, led to a bearish tinge to trading the FTSE 100 December future yesterday. In pre-trading December was indicating a level of about 4,780 but in the event it opened below this, at 4,757. This was down 65 on the previous close and 17 points below cash, with fair value estimated at a premium of about 31 points. But the bears were still not happy with this and December was knocked down to touch the low of the day, 4,700 at 10.35am. But this psychologically important support level was not breached despite the strong downward trend and December rallied slightly, only to test this area again at 1.30pm when it reached 4,705 as nervousness on the direction of the US market came to the fore. But in the event, Wall Street was not in such poor shape and December found a spring in its step in afternoon trading, and it outperformed the cash market. The contract managed to get its head above water and settlement was at 4,751, a slight premium to fair value. This less bearish stance continued into after-hours trading as December moved on about 14 points. Volume at 14,400 lots was more than double the 6,500 seen on Tuesday, while in Footsie options the 20,000 was 3,000 up.

Weakness in Asian and European markets added to the stress on US equities, especially in the financial and technology sectors, in early trade. The Federal open market committee's decision not to change interest rates had little immediate effect on the Dow and it was down 63.60 at 7,495.13 shortly after the announcement. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 index slipped 9.03 to 914.75. ""We had a fairly decent rebound, and the selling never got very intense,"" said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Connecticut, referring to the early falls. ""It's encouraging that some of the technology stocks that have been weak have begun to firm a bit."" The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index was down 23.32 to 1,561.54 by early afternoon. 3Com, the networking firm, plunged more than 7% or $2 9/16 to $32 9/16 on concerns over competition from Intel. Other networking stocks fell as the industry leader, Cisco Systems, lost $1 1/4 to $79 3/8. US Treasury bonds were higher due to turmoil in Asian equity markets and while US stocks plunged, but then changed direction as Wall Street recovered from morning lows. By early afternoon, the 30-year Treasury bond had fallen 1/16 at 99 5/8, sending the yield up to 6.148%. The banking sector was hit by a swift sell-off after an analyst downgraded his ratings of Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica due to Asian weakness. Chase shares fell $2 15/16 to $109 5/16 while J.P. Morgan lost $1 7/16 to $112 5/8.

526,1997-11-12,1997-11-13,Financial Times,Treasuries firmer as Fed holds rates.,"Frayed nerves ahead of yesterday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee sent bond markets into a tail-spin in late European trade after US Treasuries opened weaker. Though the Fed was thought unlikely to raise interest rates - for reasons including stock market volatility - some analysts said a rise would be timely because of domestic US factors. ""Everything says they should go for it,"" said Kevin Adams, bond strategist at Barclays Capital Group in London. ""The lack of a rise would suggest the Fed was behind, or about to get behind, the curve."" Putting off any rise would require a higher increase in interest rates next time, he added. In the event the FOMC left rates unchanged and, having moved lower in early trading, US TREASURIES began to firm on the news. Soon after the announcement the 30-year Treasury had risen 3/16 to 99 7/8, yielding 6.130%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 11/16, yielding 5.885% while the two-year note gained 1/32 to 99 27/32, yielding 5.692%. The Federal Funds rate was 5 9/16%. Trading was active on the market's first day back after the Veteran's Day holiday and turmoil in Asian markets had affected prices earlier in the day. ""Bond prices were up overnight as overseas equity markets declined, but that ...reversed as US equities came back from earlier lows,"" said David Ging, market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette. ""The main talk is about Japanese repatriation,"" said Tom O'Connell, senior government trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The belief is that money is being moved out of US Treasury securities to be invested in Japan in order to raise capital, and putting downward pressure on bond prices. UK GILTS took a hammering in late trading, with the December future dropping nearly a full point from its overnight close. Analysts said the fall was prompted by stop-loss selling and by one big trade. The gilt contract settled at 116 21/32, down, in heavy volume of nearly 130,000 contracts, while the yield spread over bunds widened to 124 basis points. Earlier the market had reacted well to another fall in unemployment and in earnings growth - the future at one point touched 118 1/16. However, the Bank of England's warning that inflation had not been tamed implied more interest rate rises on the horizon and gilts began to fall. Nevertheless, was no heavy cash selling, despite evidence of a switch from longer-dated securities into the five-year range. ""It was a general nervousness, a marking down of prices across the board,"" Mr Adams said. GERMAN BUNDS also retreated in late trading, dragging down other European markets. The December bund future settled in London at 102.20, a drop of 0.36, in good volume, with most activity in the five-year range because of a Bobl auction, said Heinz Gunasekera, bund specialist at UBS. The market had moved ahead earlier but was unsettled by both the FOMC meeting and a potential clash between the government and the Bundesbank over interest rate swaps. The German parliament yesterday gave the government the green light to use interest rate swaps to cut the cost of servicing the federal debt. But Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, warned the move would increase reliance on short-term financing and create more volatility in interest rate movements. However, parliament limited the amount of debt that can be swapped to DM 95bn, half what the finance ministry wanted. The move will allow the fixed-rate debt to be swapped for floating-rate debt, saving up to DM 1bn on interest payments. ITALIAN BTPs weakened but outperformed bunds as volumes picked up from previous sessions, with the December future settling 0.27 lower at 111.26. The 10-year spread over bunds narrowed to 61 basis points, with the market waiting for domestic data due tomorrow that is expected to show no disruption to the country's generally good economic outlook. SPANISH BONOS also outperformed bunds, with the 10-year spread falling to 41 points as the December future settled 0.25 lower at 103.00.

531,2008-08-05,2008-08-06,Financial Times,Equities rally amid weakening commodities,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Fed opts to keep rates unchanged US services sector data improves US and European equities rallied strongly yesterday, as investors took their lead from weaker commodities prices and strong economic data, largely ignoring the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to keep interest rates unchanged. The widely expected decision to keep the target for the federal funds rate at 2 per cent came as the Fed reiterated that the financial markets remain under ""considerable stress"". It also said that the outlook for inflation remained highly uncertain. ""Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee,"" the Fed said. Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said: ""They pretty much issued the same statement [as last month],"" ""If I had to guess the direction of the Treasury curve, you probably get it steepening. You probably get risk assets, like stocks, moving higher because any hint of a move higher in rates would have been bad for stocks and two-year Treasuries and that didn't happen."" Further support for equity bulls came from better-than-expected data on the US services sector - which accounts for about 90 per cent of the economy. Oil led a broad sell-off across the commodities spectrum, helping to soothe concerns about inflation in spite of the Fed's statement. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark US crude price, settled at $119.17 a barrel, down $2.24, having earlier touched a three-month low of $118 - nearly 20 per cent below the all-time high of $147.27. Gold retreated below the $900 an ounce mark to touch its lowest for six weeks, copper and zinc hit multi-month lows and agricultural commodities remained under pressure. Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, senior analyst at Danske Bank, said there was a clear possibility that in-creased pessimism on global growth in the next couple of months could drive commodity prices even lower. ""However, we very much believe that the commodity bull run has been fuelled by fundamentals,"" he said. ""And while the June peak in oil price might have been an exaggeration, we have to remember that non-Opec oil supply problems, Opec's hawkish stance and strong oil demand in Asia and the Middle East remain intact. Supply problems are also growing in base metals, and the costs push in agricultural is evident."" Meanwhile, the US Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index edged up to 49.5 in July from 48.2 in June - still below the 50 level which indicates contraction but a higher reading than expected. The prices-paid component fell from June's record high of 84.5 to 80.8. ""The ISM non-manufacturing measure has held within two points on either side of 50 for six consecutive months, which neatly captures the sluggish nature of the economy,"" Omair Sharif, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said. But ""the concern is always about future trajectory, and on that point, July's data were not necessarily reassuring."" Meanwhile, Eurozone service sector activity fell to a five-year low in July while retail sales in the region suffered their biggest-ever drop in June. Howard Archer, at Global Insight, said yesterday's data added to the mounting evidence the eurozone economic downturn was deepening. ""Nevertheless, stillelevated price pressures mean that the ECB will not be cutting interest rates any time soon to support economic activity and could yet raise them further."" In the UK, the services purchasing managers' index inched up to 47.4 in July from 47.1, a better-thanexpected reading. Equity markets , however, were in an uncompromisingly bullish mood on both sides of the Atlantic. At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 2.6 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average slipped 0.1 per cent, while Hong Kong tumbled 2.6 per cent. In government bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose 6 basis point to 4.02 per cent, while in Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 2bp lower at 4.31 per cent. On the currency markets , the dollar hit a seven-week high against the euro on the back of oil's early decline and barely moved following the Fed's decision."
532,2008-08-05,2008-08-06,Financial Times (FT.Com),Dollar hits 7-month high against yen,"The dollar was mixed on Wednesday, hitting a seven-month peak against the yen but easing slightly from a seven-week high against the euro and sterling as traders digested the Federal Reserve's decision on US interest rates. On Tuesday, the US central bank, as expected, kept its main Fed funds interest rates on hold at 2 per cent. Analysts said the accompanying statement was clearly designed not to rock the boat, with no clear bias between the assessment of upside US inflation risks and downside growth risks. However, it was the vote that moved markets, revealing only one member of the Federal Open Market Committee wanted to raise interest rates, against expectations for two, or possibly three, dissenters. This saw investors marginally pare back expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates by the end of the year, halting the dollar's recent rally against european currencies and boosting equities. The dollar eased 0.2 per cent to $1.5479 against the euro, lost 0.1 per cent to $1.9540 against the pound and edged 0.1 per cent lower to Sfr1.0528 against the Swiss franc. The greenback advanced against the yen, however, rising 0.3 per cent to a six-month high of Y108.60 as a solid performance from global equities boosted risk appetite and drove investors away from the safe haven of the low-yielding Japanese currency. John Normand at JPMorgan said the Fed had left little doubt that US monetary tightening was some way off. However, he said this stance still stood in stark contrast to other major global central banks which were either easing, such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, about to ease, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, suspected of easing next year, like the European Central Bank, or permanently on hold, like the Bank of Japan. ""With the US the only major economy that is not sliding into recession, the expected direction of Fed policy should sustain the dollar's gains versus the euro and commodity currencies,"" said Mr Normand. Analysts said the euro was receiving support, however, ahead of the European Central Bank's interest rate decision on Thursday, at which the central bank was widely expected to reiterate its concerns over inflation and hawkish monetary policy bias. Stuart Bennet at Calyon said with the ECB 's focus on above-target inflation, the FX market had been surprisingly indifferent to recent weak activity data from the eurozone. But he said that might change next week if growth figures showed an expected marked slowdown. Indeed, he said the EU Commission sentiment indicator was signalling a strong chance that the region's economy contracted in the second quarter. ""If correct, the spectre of a eurozone recession should finally force the FX market to sit up and listen, pushing the euro lower."" Nevertheless, the euro rose 0.1 per cent to £0.7921 against the pound and gained 0.1 per cent to SFr1.6285 against the Swiss franc. Elsewhere the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6 per cent to $0.7219 against the US dollar and lost 0.3 per cent to Y78.41 against the yen as traders awaited the New Zealand second quarter employment report. Sue Trinh at RBC Capital Markets said the figures would crucial in judging whether the country's economy was already in recession and whether market had underestimated the pace of monetary easing from the RBNZ, which was expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting. ""A greater than expected jump in the unemployment rate would increase the risk of a 50 basis-point cut, and hence weigh on the New Zealand dollar,"" she said."

The Nikkei average index dropped another 620.14 points to close at 14,309.41, its lowest close since March 1986. Dealers said the bond market rallied steadily in response to the stock market's free-fall. 'People are pouring money into the (Japanese) government bond market as they expect to see an easing in interest rates,' said one dealer. Short-term interest rates edged lower, with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit slipping from 3.90% to 3.88% yesterday. The price of the December futures contract for 10-year government bonds traded as high as 106.10, the highest level for the since August 1989. The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 4.80% to 4.71% before closing at 4.725% in Tokyo. The No 129 continued to rally in London trading, taking its cue from the strong opening in the US treasury bond market. Dealers said yesterday's announcement by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, of a package of emergency measures yesterday to restore confidence in the stock market had little impact on the bond market. AN unexpected decline in July housing starts lifted US Treasury prices across the maturity range yesterday, temporarily eclipsing the market's concerns about politically-motivated tax cuts. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 3/8 at 98, yielding 7.328%. The two-year note was markedly firmer, up 1/8 at 100 7/16, to yield 3.996%. Prices gained ground after the Commerce department reported that housing starts fell 2.8% last month, and that June's housing starts fell a revised 3.8% (they were originally reported to have declined by 3.2%). Analysts had predicted a modest upturn in housing starts for July, so the figures immediately triggered a spate of buying, especially at the short end of the yield curve. Short-dated securities were also buoyed by speculation about another policy ease. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee began its monthly meeting yesterday, and investors were hoping that continued economic weakness would persuade the FOMC to sanction another interest rate cut. AUSTRALIAN government bonds staged a strong rally following the government's annual budget announcement and promises of further cuts in interest rates. The government forecast a budget deficit for the 1992/93 fiscal year of A$13.39bn, towards the low end of expectations. The statement added that 'further reductions in interest rates will be possible if the decline in inflation and expectations of inflation is sustained,' prompting a surge in the bond market, with shorter-dated issues showing the biggest gains. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, forecast that inflation would average 2% in the year ending June 30 1993, from 1.9% last year. The government expects the economy to grow by 3% this year. The three-year bond futures contract, which had traded at around 93.08 before the announcement, climbed to 93.24. In the cash market, the yield on the 10% bond due October 2002 moved to 8.28% after the budget, from 8.37% before the announcement. GERMAN government bonds ended slightly weaker with the market awaiting today's Bundesbank tender allocation and the release of the July money supply figures. The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a fairly narrow range of 87.64-87.78, ending the day at around 87.68. Dealers warned the market would be watching the Bundesbank's tender allocation for signs of any move in interest rates. STERLING'S weakness in the foreign exchange markets depressed the UK government bond market yesterday with gilts ending the day slightly lower.

535,2008-12-16,2008-12-17,Financial Times,Upbeat news about financials bolsters equities,"global overview Goldman's loss not as bad as feared US consumer prices dip largest on record Better news on the banking front offered support to US and European equity markets yesterday although activity was subdued ahead of a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Goldman Sachs' fourth-quarter loss of $2.1bn was the investment bank's first shortfall since going public in 1999, but was not as bad as some in the markets had feared. Meanwhile, the federal open market committee was widely expected to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points from 1 per cent. Analysts said the key to the market's response would lie more in comments from the central bank on quantitative easing - a policy where the banking system is flooded with money to promote lending. US economic releases yesterday did little to undermine the view that interest rates were heading further towards zero. US consumer prices tumbled by 1.7 per cent last month - the largest drop since records began in 1947 - taking the annual rate of inflation down to 1.1 per cent, as commodity prices continued to plunge. ""With gasoline prices still falling, there is now a real chance that deflation could be a reality by the end of the year,"" said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. ""By the middle of next year inflation could be at minus 2 per cent."" Meanwhile, housing construction collapsed to a record level in November, heightening concerns about the potential depth of the US recession. The figures helped drive US government bond yields to fresh historic lows. The yield on the 30-year bond touched 2.91 per cent, the lowest for five decades, while the 10-year yield briefly fell to 2.47 per cent. A narrowing gap between the two and 10-year yields underscored investors' concerns about a protracted recession and a deflationary spiral. European government bonds also maintained a firmer tone, with the 10-year Bund yield down 7bp at 3.14 per cent and the 10-year UK gilt yield 6bp lower at 3.40 per cent. UK consumer price inflation fell by less than expected last month, but the markets paid little heed to the figures. ""This is very much yesterday's news regarding the problems facing the UK economy,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Indeed, inflation seems set to plunge over the coming months."" On the currency markets , sterling steadied following its recent slide against the euro as the focus remained firmly on the dollar ahead of the FOMC decision. The US currency set a fresh two-month low against the single currency and hovered near a 13-year trough against the yen. The euro was helped by ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet's comment that eurozone interest rates could not be cut forever. ""President Trichet app-eared very marginally to restate the view that the ECB was not preparing for a further policy rate cut at its January 15 meeting,"" said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital. Goldman's earnings helped buoy financial stocks on both sides of the Atlantic, driving equity markets higher. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.9 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.9 per cent higher. But Asian bank stocks put in much less positive performances ahead of the Goldman results. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average fell 1.1 per cent, while Australian shares shed 1 per cent. The better tone in equities allowed US and European cred it spreads to tighten. The iTraxx Europe index - a gauge of the cost of insuring against investment-grade companies defaulting on debt - dropped 9bp to 198bp while its US counterpart, the CDX North America index, fell 9.5bp to 254.5bp. In the money markets , interbank lending rates generally continued to ease although two-week dollar and euro Libor rose sharply, reflecting year-end tightness. Oil continued to dominate commodities markets ahead of today's Opec meeting, which is expected to result in hefty output cuts. There was much talk that Russia could also reduce supply in tandem with an Opec move. The benchmark US crude price was up 59 cents at $45.10 a barrel, after briefly spiking above $50 on Monday. Gold fell 0.3 per cent."

There was little economic news of substance yesterday, and attention was fixed on the monthly meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee.

538,1995-02-01,1995-02-02,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - SHARES CLOSE STRONGLY IN AN OPTIMISTIC MARKET - MARKET REPORT.,"The London market closed firmly yesterday, still awaiting news on interest rate policies from the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Wall Street was 10 Dow points up as the UK market ended trading for the day, and the FT-SE 100-share Index showed a final gain of 25.7 at 3,017.3. Setting aside the uncertainty surrounding the FOMC meeting, the UK stock market looked confident, showing a gain of 32 points at the day's best. After opening firmly behind the generally good reception from world markets for President Clinton's new support plan for Mexico, UK equities received further encouragement from British government bonds. Bonds welcomed news of a fall in the January manufacturing index of the UK Purchasing Managers Association, which seemed to indicate slower economic growth and thus reduced pressure for higher base rates. Today, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England hold their regular discussions on interest rate policy. Corporate developments took a back seat in the early part of the trading session. Glaxo, with its trading statement now due, moved forward as investors looked for the next development in its #9bn plus bid for Wellcome, which also gained ground. Sandoz, the Swiss group, appeared to rule itself out as a possible white knight for Wellcome, strengthening the view that a new contender will prove hard to find. Utilities turned down, against the market trend, reacting sharply to reports that the electricity regulator would call for Trafalgar House to refloat 25% of Northern Electric's equity, should its bid succeed, in order to maintain regulatory influence. Such a move would have implications across the utility sectors, which are regarded as bid targets, but turnover in these stocks was not heavy yesterday. Bid speculation also returned to the merchant bank stocks, with investors not put off by recent bid denials. SG Warburg, regarded as in play since the collapse of its merger talks with Morgan Stanley, advanced, as did Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank thought likely to attract interest. But the highlight of the day came when Vodafone, the cellular phone group which is one of the market's favourite growth stocks, said profits will fall short of market expectations. Heavy trading in Vodafone saw the shares lose ground sharply before rallying. Seaq trading volume, swollen by the late spurt in corporate activity, jumped to 616.4m shares from under 500m in the previous session. Tuesday's retail business was worth #1.15bn but recent trends in the marketplace suggest that good retail business overall has not spread across the full range of City firms. Turnover has been regularly swollen by large portfolio trades which tend to be handled by a select few of the larger houses. Hints of further staff cutbacks among London-based securities firms have begun to circulate once more. Yesterday, Nomura, the Japanese securities house, made severe cutbacks among its UK stock market staff. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
539,1995-02-01,1995-02-02,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - DREDGING COMPANIES SUSTAIN TOKYO ACTIVITY.,"Tokyo Buying of dredging companies helped to sustain trade, and the Nikkei 225 average closed higher after moving in a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was ahead 89.65 at 18,739.47 after a low of 18,609.90 and high of 18,868.93. Share prices advanced in the morning on purchasing of construction related stocks and arbitrage buying. However, profit-taking by companies and individuals later eroded some of the gains. Volume came to 731m shares, against 838m. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 0.30 at 1,464.14 and the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.04 to 268.85. Gainers led losers by 555 to 487, with 148 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.61 at 1,196.70. Arbitrage buying helped high-technology issues, which saw profit-taking by foreign investors on Tuesday. But expectations that export-orientated companies would be hit by a slowdown in the US economy prompted profit-taking later in the sector. Dredging shares fluctuated heavily on speculative activity: Penta-Ocean Construction, the day's most active issue, rose Y 13 to Y 946. The Tokyo stock exchange temporarily suspended trading in the stock in the afternoon following its climb above Y 1,000 for the first time since June 1992. Traders said the bulk of activity came from individual investors. Construction stocks headed the list of most actively traded issues. Aoki, however, ended unchanged at Y 695, while Toyo Construction gained Y 20 at Y 795. General contractors retreated on profit-taking, with Obayashi slipping Y 20 to Y 785. Some truck makers advanced on hopes of higher demand linked to the rebuilding of Kobe, the city damaged by last month's earthquake. Tokyu Car added Y 24 at Y 609 and Nippon Sharyo moved up Y 20 to Y 1,000. Banks, which had posted strong gains earlier in the week on reports of Sumitomo Bank's bad loan write-off, lost ground on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y 40 to Y 2,630 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y 50 to Y 1,810. Electronic stocks rebounded. Hitachi gained Y 4 at Y 858 and Fujitsu Y 22 at Y 879. Consumer electronic maker Sony advanced Y 110 to Y 4,700 and Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y 50 to Y 1,430. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 54.83 at 20,610.70 in volume of 123.9m shares. Roundup The region offered varying responses to US President Bill Clinton's new initiative on aid for Mexico. Hong Kong, Seoul, Taiwan, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur remained closed for the lunar new year holidays. MANILA welcomed the Clinton package with a 2.3% gain, the composite index climbing 56.76 to 2,476.88. Philippine Long Distance Telephone rose 50 pesos or 3.9% to 1,325 pesos, while Petron appreciated 1 peso or 5.7% to 18.50 pesos in the heaviest volume of the day. Turnover soared from 590m pesos to 2.49bn pesos. B shares in another blue chip, Manila Electric (Meralco), rallied 10 pesos to 278 pesos after being badly hit by foreign selling over the previous week. BANGKOK rose on the prospect of a US interest rate increase at yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington. The finance sector gained 2.4%, energy stocks 5.1% and banks 1.6% as the SET index put on 20.79 or 1.7% at 1,238.53 in 50.1m shares traded valued at Bt3.3bn, up from Bt1.7bn. KARACHI advanced 1.3% on short-covering, the KSE 100 index rising 23.82 to 1,810.75. Dealers also saw some buying in telecoms and synthetic fibre shares. BOMBAY reversed early gains on rumours that exchange officials had ordered some traders with large outstanding positions to reduce them. The BSE 30-share index finished 48.88 or 1.35% off at 3,569.66. COLOMBO's all-share index dropped 14.47 or 1.5% to 945.51 as turnover nearly doubled, from Rs 17.74m to Rs 33.3m. Dealers said continued retail selling more than outweighed some selective institutional buying interest. SYDNEY ended broadly mixed, banks surging on the back of recent positive reports by the Standard &Poor's, Moody's, and IBCA rating agencies, while gold stocks continued their downward slide after a $2 fall in the bullion price.

540,1995-02-01,1995-02-02,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL BONDS - ATTENTION SWITCHES TO MINOR CURRENCIES.,"Eurobond issuance slowed to a trickle yesterday as investors waited for the expected rise in dollar interest rates from the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Borrowers' attention has switched to minor currencies, which are less affected by changes in dollar rates. For instance, the European Investment Bank is believed to be entering the drachma sector with a floating-rate five-year bond. Yesterday saw developments in the peseta, Ecu and D-Mark sectors. The European Investment Bank brought a Pta25bn, three-year deal carrying an 11.2% coupon through book-runner Banco Santander de Negocios and joint lead UBS. The banks worked together on the EIB's Pta20bn offering last October and its increase in November. Yesterday's issue was sold in Switzerland and the Benelux region to retail investors. Commerzbank Overseas Finance used Commerzbank to bring a floating-rate issue in two tranches of DM 250m, over five and 10 years. The market-maker will be Commerzbank Financial Products (CFP), the bank's derivatives arm, which started operating in October. The coupon is reset each year and linked to an index of 10-year bonds. Mr Paul Mizrahi, head of interest rate derivatives at CFP, said this allowed investors to diversify portfolios while reducing volatility. He said the bonds were sold to retail and institutional investors in Germany, Austria and France. Commerzbank said this was the first DM bond with a coupon reset annually and linked to an index. There has been a market since 1986 in such bonds in France, where FFr 130bn worth have been issued. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
541,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times,Investors focus on inflation comments.,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW By Dave Shellock The US Federal Reserve gave global financial markets exact ly what they wanted yesterday, raising the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent and, more crucially, retaining its vow to keep its ""measured"" approach. The central bank also referred to more robust growth while hinting at greater concern about inflation risks. ""These discreet changes by the FOMC reflect the Fed's increasing concern over disrupting the liquidity of the US economy by pressing too hard on the brakes - at a time when the US engine risks facing obstacles from rising oil and from spillover effect from a GM downgrade,"" said Laidi Ashraf, chief currency analyst at MG Financial in New York. The rate rise - the seventh consecutive tightening - was widely expected and had been factored into share prices. Investors took the view that the wording of the accompanying statement implied a continuation of the Fed's modest quarter-point rate increases. However, Wall Street wobbled in the immediate aftermath of the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.4 per cent shortly before the news, fell briefly into negative territory before recovering to stand 0.1 per cent higher at 10,578. The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher while the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.3 per cent. European stock markets - which closed before the Fed delivered its statement - made modest progress, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rising 0.2 per cent to 1,081.66. Asian stock markets had a generally negative day, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Average slipping 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong 0.4 per cent. The dollar moved to its best level of the day following the Fed's announcement. Earlier, its recent rally had stalled in spite of strongerthan- expected US inflation data. US consumer price data for February are due for release today. Treasury bond yields spiked to their best levels in eight months immediately after the announcement. US oil futures fell sharply as the market pondered the possibility of further quota increases by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Elsewhere in commodities, the price of gold managed to stay above key support at the Dollars 430-an-ounce mark as the dollar's recent rally slowed. On Monday, gold fell to its lowest level for two weeks, triggering demand for the metal from jewellers. "

The rise was widely expected, and the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated in its statement that it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace, generally interpreted to mean quarter point increases. But the central bank held out the possibility that it might have to move more aggressively to curb inflationary pressures, or at least to continue with quarter-point increases for longer than investors had been expecting. ""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,"" the statement said. The FOMC said it saw the risks to growth and inflation as roughly equal. But, in contrast to its statement in January, it made clear that this judgment was based on ""appropriate monetary policy action"". The Fed also said output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view of ""moderate"" growth, despite rising energy prices. Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ""They got about as hawkish as they could without changing the key policy language. They are inclined to continue with 25 basis point increases, but wanted to reassure the market they would do more if necessary."" Bonds and stocks sold off on the announcement, with the yield on the 10- year Treasury note rising above 4.6 per cent, an eight-month high. The dollar strengthened against the euro and yen. Yesterday's rise was the seventh consecutive quarter-point move since the Fed started tightening policy in June. Each time, the Fed said it expected to continue raising rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Some Fed policymakers say the forward-looking guidance should be dropped altogether because it constrains their room for manoeuvre. While some regional Fed presidents have become increasingly concerned about inflation risks, others fear structural drags on growth from the trade deficit and the low savings rate might dampen the economy. Yesterday's statement made it clear that a shift to 50 basis point increases was more likely at this stage than a pause in tightening. The FOMC also repeated that after yesterday's move, the stance of monetary policy remained ""accommodative"". The so-called neutral or equilibrium federal funds rate - where monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with price stability - is typically described by policymakers in a range centred about 4 1/4 per cent over time. Data released since the February meeting have confirmed the Fed's bank consensus forecast of robust, above-trend growth this year. As confidence in the economy's strength has increased, Fed policymakers have turned their attention to inflation risks. While policymakers are confident continued rate increases will prevent inflation rising, at a time when strong growth is using up spare capacity and labour market slack there is greater sensitivity to inflation risks. The core producer price index, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.1 per cent last month, data out yesterday showed. It was below January's 0.8 per cent rise, but in the year to February, the core PPI was up by 2.7 per cent. Lex, Page 16 Short view, Page 17 World Stocks, Page 28 "

Data released since February's meeting have confirmed the Fed's forecast of robust above trend growth this year. However, there is increased sensitivity to mounting inflation pressures, shown in the producer price index and also in some measures of consumer inflation, at a time when strong growth leaves less slack in the economy. The core producer price index, excluding food and energy, rose only 0.1 per cent after January's 0.8 per cent rise, it was announced yesterday. In the 12 months to February, the core PPI was up by 2.7 per cent. Peter Kretzmer, economist at Bank of America, pointed to a ""continued upward tilt"" in core producer price inflation. ""For the Fed, the report gave little reason to further ratchet upward inflation concerns but also did little to reduce concerns that are already present,"" he said. The Fed, in its Beige Book released before the meeting, had noted reports of increased pricing power from manufacturers, though this was not yet showing up in retail prices.

546,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar rallies after Fed statement.,"The dollar rallied to a one-month high against the euro in European morning trade on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve made hawkish noises about monetary tightening and a key measure of the state of the German economy disappointed. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent overnight, and reiterated its view that policy accommodation can be removed at a ""measured"" pace. But the FOMC warned that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident"", and said output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view of ""moderate"" growth. The comments led to renewed speculation that the Fed, which has raised rates by 25 basis points at each of its last seven meetings, may decide to slip in a 50-point hike at some point - boosting yield support for the dollar by pushing Treasury yields higher, and potentially making dollar-funded carry trades more expensive. ""Although the measured reference was left intact, the Fed's increased inflationary vigilance coupled with a discreet upgrade in its growth assessment promise the cusp of further interest rate hikes along with the possibility of faster rate hikes,"" said Ashraf Laidi chief currency analyst at MG Financial. Monica Fan, global head of forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the tightening cycle could now extend beyond January, with rates potentially exceeding RBC's forecast of 4 per cent by the year-end, although an acceleration in inflation would be needed to produce a 50-point rate hike. ""The risk to our year-end Fed fund forecast of 3.75 per cent is now clearly to the upside,"" added James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. This sentiment allowed the dollar to strengthen to $1.3037 to the euro, 1.6c better than before the Fed statement, Y105.68 against the yen, Y0.6 better, $1.8794 against sterling, 1.85c better, and $0.7768 versus the Australian dollar, 1.4c better. The New Zealand dollar was particularly badly hit, falling 1.4c to $0.7255 as New Zealand's current account deficit widened to NZ$3.1bn in the fourth quarter, against expectations for NZ$2.4bn. The deficit equalled 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2004 as a whole. The euro's cause was not helped by the Ifo index of German business sentiment, which fell to 94 in March, from 95.4 in February, with the retail and manufacturing sectors both gloomier. The euro drifted Y0.3 to Y137.75 against the yen, although it held firm at GBP0.6933 against sterling. The pound was little affected by the release of the March monetary policy committee minutes, which showed the MPC voted by a 7-2 majority to keep interest rate on hold at 4.75 per cent. Despite the vote being narrower than of late, the consensus was that the minutes were broadly dovish. ""The minutes noted that for most members, the evidence on the two pivotal issues of consumer demand and inflation had not changed substantially since the February meeting. On balance, and given the slightly softer run of the data since this meeting, it is not clear that the next move from the MPC will necessarily be up, even if this is the direction that some committee members have been moving,"" said Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets. ""To judge by the largely dovish tone of these minutes, the doves are going to take considerable convincing if they are to flip and vote for a hike. 'Wait and see' remains the order of the day. Thus, the market will have to revisit their expectations for a hike, and the current sell-off in sterling has further to run,"" added Daragh Maher, senior forex strategist at Calyon. "
547,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed shows first signs of becoming less friendly.,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday left the key policy language unchanged in its statement accompanying the latest quarter point increase in interest rates. But the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee sent the signal that it was alive to growing inflation risks and would act, as needed, to prevent accelerating inflation. ""This may be the beginning of the less friendly Federal Reserve,"" said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers. Speculation before the meeting had centred on whether the Fed would drop its forward-looking guidance that it expects to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. Instead the committee maintained that assurance, generally seen as pointing to quarter point increases, while changing the rest of the statement, including more upbeat language on growth. The statement, which spoke of a pick-up in inflation pressures in recent months and more evident pricing power, echoed the Fed's recent Beige Book report that manufacturers were finding it easier to pass on higher commodity prices. While accelerating inflation is not an immediate danger, commodity price increases continue to feed into higher producer prices, compounded by pressure from a weaker dollar. The high oil price is seen as an inflation risk, in contrast to last year's concerns that it would sap growth. Modest increases in unit labour costs are not a reason to worry but the prospect that wages may pick up over the next year is a cause for vigilance. The wild-card is productivity growth, which is helping to keep a lid on inflation but may not continue to do so. While the Fed on Tuesday stuck with its judgment that the risks to the inflation and growth outlook remained balanced, it placed a new stress on the fact that this depended on ""appropriate monetary action"". For now the appropriate response is seen as continuing quarter point rises. The committee may have maintained the ""measured"" language so as not to signal a 50 basis point increase when it meets next in May. But it can be seen as a warning to investors to expect a longer tightening cycle. Some committee members have also expressed concerns about structural drags on growth, though Tuesday's statement confirmed that those worries have diminished. At some point, attention may also turn from removing what is seen as unnecessary policy ""accommodation"" from a still low 2.75 per cent federal funds rate to seeking to dampen growth at a time when spare capacity and labour market slack is being used up. ""If you are going to worry at all about inflation then you have to start restraining growth,"" Mr Harris said. When Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, gave testimony on behalf of the committee last month, he expressed surprise that the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was only 4 per cent, in spite of the Fed rate increases since last June. Since then the 10-year yield has risen to 4.5 per cent still low based on past experience, economists say. Tuesday's signal of a less friendly Fed was enough to push it above 4.6 per cent. "
548,1995-12-19,1995-12-20,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - US TREASURIES RALLY SHARPLY AS FED CUTS RATE.,"US Treasury bonds rallied sharply yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced that it had cut the target short-term interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5 1/2%. Short term notes soared on news of the rate cut, while longer term bonds were not able to regain all the ground lost in Monday's sell-off. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1 1/4 higher at 110 11/32 to yield 6.110%, still below its levels of late Friday. At the short end of the market, however, two-year notes added 1/4 to 100 3/32, yielding 5.305%, well below the 5.356% they were yielding on Friday. Bonds began rising in the early afternoon before the Fed announcement, amid growing optimism that the Fed would move and that President Bill Clinton and Congress were making progress toward passage of a balanced budget agreement. The yield curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year bonds steepened by more than 4 basis points from its level of late Monday, as the short end of the market rallied. Initial reaction to the Fed's move was muted as some investors used the initial rise to take profits, according to Mr John Spinello, a government bonds strategist at Merrill Lynch. Bonds had seen a sharp sell-off on Monday as growing acrimony over the budget worried many investors that the Fed would not cut rates this month. Investors were still looking to Washington for indications of progress on a budget package. Mr Clinton and Congressional leaders began a negotiating session yesterday afternoon. European government bond markets were generally softer yesterday as dealers awaited news from the FOMC meeting in the US. There was no sign that the Fed funds rate would be lowered. Trading remained thin across the board as markets wound down for the long holiday break over Christmas and the new year. UK government bonds saw their spread over Germany widen slightly to 157 basis points from just under 150 basis points on Monday as several support levels were breached, causing technical selling in the futures market. Analysts said profit-taking was inevitable after the market's strong performance over past weeks. On Liffe, the March contract of the long gilt future fell 9/16 to 109 13/16 in modest volume of just over 50,000 lots. Some data scheduled for today are unlikely to provide the market with fresh direction. The market is expecting non-EU trade figures for November, which should show a deficit of #800m, provisional M4 data for November, expected to show a rise of 0.8% on the month and 8.7% on the year, and November net new commitments by building societies, forecast at #3.1bn. German government bonds recouped some of Monday's losses but still ended the day lower. On Liffe, the March bund future traded between a low of 98.14 and a high of 98.75 before settling down 0.19 points at 98.60 in volume of 141,000 contracts. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
549,1995-12-19,1995-12-20,Financial Times,MARKETS - SYDNEY LEADS GENERAL RETREAT BUT SEOUL RALLIES 2.7% - ASIA PACIFIC.,"Tokyo Monday's heavy fall on Wall Street unnerved investors, and the Nikkei 225 average declined for the third consecutive day on technical selling and profit-taking of high-technology stocks, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 170.59 at 19,140.49 after moving between 19,077.12 and 19,242.03. Worries over US shares prompted a fall in futures prices, triggering arbitrage unwinding. The delay over the solution for jusen, or housing loan companies, also eroded investor confidence. Volume was 370m shares, against 340.7m. Overseas investors sold high-technology shares, while investment trusts also unloaded holdings. However, domestic institutions were seen bargain hunting at lower levels, preventing a large sell-off. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 11.54 to 1,520.12, while the Nikkei 300 shed 2.01 to 285.79. Declines outnumbered advances by 820 to 246, with 155 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 5.02 at 1,320.38. High-technology issues were heavily sold: Hitachi dropped Y 22 to Y 968 and Toshiba Y 6 to Y 761. NEC declined Y 20 to Y 1,200 on rising fears of a slowdown of personal computer sales in the US, as well as a fall in semiconductor prices. Selling by foreigners also prompted profit-taking by domestic investors, who had actively bought the sector earlier in the year. Banks were mixed as negotiations over the jusen solution continued. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y 20 to Y 3,100, but Bank of Tokyo gained Y 10 at Y 1,750. Analysts do not expect shares to rise on an eventual solution, since the use of public funds in dealing with the housing loan companies' bad loans are already factored into share prices. Brokers, which had been bought on the rise in trading volume on the Tokyo stock market, were lower. Nomura Securities retreated Y 30 to Y 7,430 and Yamaichi Securities lost Y 20 to Y 700. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 170.43 to 20,588.80 in volume of 133.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gave up Y 170 to Y 7,770 and Rohm, the semiconductor maker, shed Y 260 to Y 5,530. Roundup The overnight drop on Wall Street was a major influence in the movement of the region's equity markets yesterday. But Seoul followed its own agenda. SYDNEY fell sharply as investors unwound positions ahead of the expiry of December futures and caution ahead of the US FOMC meeting. The All Ordinaries index was off 24.9 at 2,182.80 after an intra-day low of 2,172.10. Turnover came to 220.64m shares worth A$801.2m. Leading the active stocks was BHP, down 20 cents at A$18.76, while CRA dipped 19 cents to A$21.32 and News Corp 10 cents to A$7.51. The banking sector index slid 66.80 or 2% to 3,220.70, with Advance Bank ending 11 cents cheaper at A$10.25, ANZ off 8 cents to A$6.22, Westpac 6 cents lower at A$5.60 and Commonwealth down 3 cents to A$10.68. Tubemakers rose 45 cents to A$4.05 following BHP's offer for the shares in the company it does not already own. SEOUL brought an end to its seven-day streak of steep declines to finish on a high note, after a strong technical rebound and buying interest sparked by Dacom's auction. The composite stock index added 23.61 or 2.7% at 890.79 in volume of 20.9m shares. LG Semicon, an unlisted affiliate of the LG Group, bought 1.3m shares of Dacom from Korea Long-Term Credit Bank at Won280,100 per share. This sent LG shares up strongly. LG Electronics climbed Won1,500 to Won26,600 and LG climbed Won600 to Won11,300, both up the day's limit. Dacom closed limit down, falling Won7,500 to Won120,500. Korea Long-Term rose Won500 to Won23,300. HONG KONG finished 1% lower, but analysts suggested that the day's fall had purged the market of inflated expectations of a US rate cut following the FOMC meeting. The Hang Seng index was down 100.72 at 9,705.86 after climbing off a morning low of 9,647.74. Turnover improved but was still thin at HKDollars 2.9bn. HSBC topped the losers, ending HKDollars 1.50 weaker at HKDollars 113.50, though off the day's worst of HKDollars 112. WELLINGTON weakened but recovered quite strongly from the session's low. The NZSE-40 index lost a net 15.68 at 2,097.08 after falling to 2,080.07. Fletcher Challenge was the hardest hit, falling 7 cents to NZ$3.52 but recovering from its trough of NZ$3.44. Telecom shed 5 cents to NZ$6.45. TAIPEI was in retreat but brokers said overall sentiment remained optimistic after recent buying from brokerages and institutions. The weighted index finished a net 30.75 down at 5,082.17 following an intra-session low of 5,048.85. Turnover amounted to TDollars 50bn. Electronics led the falls, following a plunge in Wall Street's high-technology issues, but brokers said the sector was also encountering a correction after its previous rises. Paper and cement shares were the only gainers. SINGAPORE was weak, awaiting the outcome of the FOMC meeting, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 13.20 down at 2,187.34. HeShe Holding was again the most active stock, in volume of 12.5m shares, following news that a large investor, First Capital, was getting out of the loss-making company. HeShe shares ended unchanged at 49 cents. KUALA LUMPUR was lower, with overseas funds unable to find compelling reasons to buy in the market, and analysts noted that the run-up in second line and second board issues seen in recent days also appeared to have run out of steam. The composite index finished 6.51 down at 977.49. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
550,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,Hint of rise as US Fed holds rates.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday but suggested further rate rises might be needed to curb inflation. In a statement accompanying the widely expected decision that followed a two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed pointed to data suggesting economic growth was moderating towards a more sustainable pace. While underlying inflation had risen slightly, it said gains in productivity were continuing to contain price pressures. But it said these signs of slowing growth were ""still tentative and preliminary"". Referring to the continued tightness in the jobs market, the Fed said the committee believed ""the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future"". The Fed has raised rates by 1 3/4 percentage points since it began its current monetary tightening last year to put the benchmark federal funds rate at 6.5 per cent, its highest level in nine years. In May the Fed lifted the funds rate - the interest rate at which prime banks lend to each other overnight in the New York money market - by a half percentage point, the first time it had made a move of that magnitude in more than five years. However, the decision to leave rates unchanged yesterday does pose some risks for the Fed. The FOMC's next regular meeting is not until eight weeks' time. By then, the US presidential election campaign will be well under way and interest rate increases then could see the Fed becoming embroiled in the campaign.

551,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unmoved by Fed rate decision.,"The dollar showed little reaction to the widely expected decision by the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged yesterday. The decision follows a series of figures suggesting that the US economy is slowing. Durable goods orders from the US, however, released prior to the rate decision, cast some doubt on the notion of a rapid cooling of the US economy. But there was little reaction in the foreign exchange markets to the news. With activity minimal ahead of the FOMC decision, many analysts were focusing on the potential impact of Deutsche Telekom's bumper bond issue. Since the lion's share of the $15bn has been in US dollars, there has been speculation that some of the proceeds will be swapped back into euros - providing welcome support for the currency. But Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast, said the effect was far from certain. ""It is also quite possible that Deutsche Telekom will wish to keep the bulk of the money in dollars to provide for forays into the US market,"" he said. * Economists who charged the European Central Bank with being too aggressive several weeks ago in its 0.5 percentage point rate rise are now being forced to eat a little humble pie. Inflation data out of Europe provided ample retrospective justification for the move and may even warrant further action in the short term, analysts said yesterday. Most alarming was the rise in German import prices, which leaped into double figures. But the 2.7 per cent rise in Italian consumer prices for June also topped analysts' expectations. The figures had only a marginal effect on the euribor strip, the market's best guess of future interest rate movements. However many economists suspect that ECB claims that it had cleared the horizon for some time may have proved premature. ""The several month rate pause that many had expected after the last rise may end up being shorter than anticipated,"" said Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast. This could bode well for the euro, analysts said. Interest rates are back in the driving seat in the foreign exchange markets, said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street, the Boston-based investment bank. ""As risk appetites recovered in May, the focus has changed in the foreign exchange markets from looking for safety to looking for value and yield,"" said Mr Persaud. ""Interest rate differentials have increased in importance as a determinant of foreign exchange movements."" He added that the differential between US and European rates now looked likely to narrow still further. * While the market is becoming ever more convinced of the cyclical arguments for a euro revival, yesterday's current account figures from the euro-zone offered a reminder of the structural barriers which remain. The net outflow of direct investment funds from the euro-zone, which hit Euros 149bn in 1999, has been cited as one of the main weights on the euro. For the first three months of the year, this trend appeared to have abated with a series of positive figures. But with the massive inflow arising Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann now removed from the figures, the euro-zone once again has a direct investment deficit. According to yesterday's figures Euros 6.2bn of direct investment left the zone in April. The basic balance - a measure of the balance of payments which excludes short term flows - still looks negative for the euro, said Tony Norfield, global head of foreign exchange research at ABN Amro in London. ""In the first 4 months of the year the euro-zone ran a basic balance deficit of Euros 17.3bn, which may help explain why the recovery in the euro has not yet fully taken hold,"" he said. "
552,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Equities spend anxious day watching the Fed.,"London's equity market remained gripped with anxiety over the course of US interest rates ahead of the FOMC meeting. The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged came at 7.15pm, long after London closed for the day. ""The market has been spooked by worries over what the statement with the interest rate news will say,"" said one marketmaker. He insisted that there had once again been no really heavy selling pressure in the market, and that the institutions had simply shut up shop until the US decision was out of the way. The end of the second quarter on Friday was another factor inhibiting market operators. Already suffering from the long-standing interest rate jitters, London dipped further in the afternoon as the latest US economic data showed that durable goods orders rose 6 per cent in May, compared with a consensus forecast of 3 per cent. The market's super stocks, which carry enormous impact because of their weightings, were given a rough ride, driving the index sharply lower. Vodafone AirTouch, the UK's biggest stock by market capitalisation, accounted for more than 30 Footsie points. BP Amoco wiped another 13 points off the index, while Shell was similarly depressed as was BT and Cable &Wireless. By the end of the session the FTSE 100 was looking extremely weary, down 61.8 at 6,313.5, after 6,310.8. But the weakness in the heavyweight stocks did not extend across the board. There remained plenty of winners in the top 100 stocks, including many of the recently weak banks, and Freeserve, the internet service provider which was so badly damaged by the withdrawal of T-Online from bid negotiations. Dealers pointed out, however, that Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which forecast the steep decline in Freeserve shares, had cut its price target again, down to 280p. The rest of the stock market was much better behaved. The FTSE 250 nudged up 5.3 to 6,578.4. The FTSE SmallCap eased 3.5 to 3,364.5 despite the emergence of a couple of bids. The Techmark 100 settled 13.93 off at 3,400.10. James Montier, strategist at Old Mutual Securities, delivered a bullish assessment of London equities. ""The UK stock market has firmly refused to celebrate the increasingly consensual view that UK short-term interest rates will not have to go much higher. Both the interest rate futures market and the bond market have shown no such qualms and have enjoyed substantial rallies. ""Perhaps the UK market has been suffering an earnings headwind. However, this has now turned and analysts are upgrading forecasts. We can find no fundamental cause for the market's current malaise. ""Valuations against bonds appear very supportive of stocks. With earnings momentum now favourable it is time to overweight UK equities."" "
553,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Investors cautious before Fed decision.,"The news from the Fed that it was keeping US interest rates on hold this month took nobody by surprise, writes Michael Morgan. And just as important, neither did the Fed's hint of another rate rise to come later in the year. Many analysts have already pencilled in a 25 basis points rise at the FOMC's next meeting on August 22. ""This is precisely what the markets had been expecting,"" said James Barty at Deutsche Bank. ""The markets will now start looking for a steer from the NAPM and payrolls data which come next week."" Even though the consensus had been for inaction by the Fed yesterday, the very threat of a rise in US rates this month has been casting an increasingly long shadow over European markets in recent sessions. Yesterday was no exception, with most bourses still stymied by investors' reluctance to commit funds ahead of a clear Fed statement. Nonetheless, the chemicals and healthcare sectors had a good day. There was some action in Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms group, as the chairman, Juan Villalonga, his future in doubt because of an insider trading investigation, faced a board meeting. However, the company said after the five-hour gathering that only routine matters had been discussed. Tech stocks had a tough time, with Nokia closing at its lowest since May 30, after failing to impress analysts at a meeting on Tuesday. Wall Street was higher in morning trade helped by Hewlett-Packard, which bounced higher after Lehman Brothers added the company to it list of 10 ""uncommon value"" stocks. Asia charted its own course, edging slightly higher after another day of wary trade, awaiting news on US rates. Tokyo endured a jittery session as attention began to shift to next Tuesday's quarterly tankan survey of business confidence from the Bank of Japan. Fed caution added to the problems facing Taipei, already hit by Taiwan-China tensions, Wall Street's volatility and lending irregularities involving some local financial institutions. "
554,2004-01-28,2004-01-29,Financial Times,Fed's signal fuels expectations of interest rate rise.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday but tweaked the accompanying statement, leading investors to conclude that it was softening its signal that rates would remain low for some time. In the statement, the Fed's open market committee dropped the expression it has used since August - that policy can remain accommodative ""for a considerable period"". Instead, it said: ""The committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" Long-term interest rates and the dollar rose sharply as soon as the statement was released while stocks fell. The futures market began to price in a better-than-evens chance of a quarter-point increase as soon as June. The markets concluded that dropping the expression ""considerable period"", which caused controversy on the FOMC when it was first introduced, gave the Fed more leeway to tighten policy in the near future. Most economists had expected the phrase to stay in. ""It is easier for the Fed to drop the 'being patient' phrase when they think they want to hike than for them to drop 'considerable period,'"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. Further clues to the Fed's thinking are likely to arise when Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, gives his semi-annual testimony to Congress on February 11. The rest of the statement was largely unchanged from December's meeting, with the FOMC retaining a neutral balance of risks around economic growth and a marginal downward risk to inflation. The Fed appeared to play down weak jobs data released this month, arguing: ""Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labour market"". Since its last meeting in December, data have been released showing an unexpected fall in inflation. But consumer sentiment has been strong and the Fed is confident that the US economic recovery remains on track. A small cloud of doubt was cast over the recovery by the release of data yesterday suggesting that business investment fell unexpectedly in December. Official figures from the Commerce Department showed overall orders for durable goods were unchanged between November and December, while economists had on average expected a 2 per cent increase. Non-defence capital goods spending excluding aircraft, which many economists take as a close proxy for business investment, fell 0.4 per cent. Lex, Page 14 Background, www.ft.com/useconomy"
555,2004-01-28,2004-01-29,Financial Times,Dollar rises as Fed leaves rates unchanged OPEN MARKETS COMMITTEE.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday but tweaked the accompanying statement, leading investors to conclude that it was softening its signal that rates would remain low for some time to come. In the statement released with the decision, the Fed's open market committee dropped the expression it has used since last summer - that policy can remain accommodative ""for a considerable period"". Instead, it said: ""The committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" Long-term interest rates and the dollar rose sharply as soon as the statement was released, with investors bringing forward their expectations of when rates would rise. The 10-year Treasury bond yield regained the levels it was trading at early this month before weak payroll jobs data for December drove it lower. The markets concluded that dropping the expression ""considerable period"" - which caused controversy on the FOMC when it was first introduced - gave the Fed more leeway to tighten policy in the near future. Most economists had expected the phrase to stay in. The rest of the statement was largely unchanged from December's meeting, with the FOMC retaining a neutral balance of risks around economic growth and a marginal downward risk to inflation. The Fed appeared to play down the jobs figures, arguing: ""Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labour market"". In each of the past two meetings, the Fed has made modest shifts which have reduced expectations of rates being left on hold. In the December meeting, it shifted the balance of risks around inflation almost to neutral. Since its last meeting in December, data have been released showing an unexpected fall in inflation. But consumer sentiment has been strong and the Fed is confident that the US economic recovery remains on track. A small cloud of doubt was cast over the recovery by the release of data yesterday suggesting that business investment fell unexpectedly in December. Official figures from the commerce department showed overall orders for durable goods were unchanged between November and December, while economists had on average expected a 2 per cent increase. Non-defence capital goods spending excluding aircraft, which many economists take as a close proxy for business investment, fell 0.4 per cent. The figures underline the fact that despite encouraging signs the US economy has yet to enter a period of strong, sustained recovery in investment. But the data are highly volatile from month to month, and financial markets read little into the figures. "
556,2004-01-28,2004-01-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),Bourses rattled by Fed's unexpected move.,"European stock markets remained on the back foot on Thursday afternoon as Wall Street got off to an uncertain start in the wake of comments by the Federal Reserve that prompted concerns that US interest rates could soon heading higher. The FTSE Eurotop 300 index was down 0.7 per cent at 989.27, off a low of 985.14. On Wednesday, the index of Europe's leading companies closed at its best level in 17 months ahead of the Fed's statement. The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt slipped 0.9 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris shed 1 per cent while London's FTSE 100 was 1.1 per cent lower. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 10,484.07 but well off an initial high of 10,522.04. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.5 per cent. ""The Fed provided a major surprise for the markets with the latest twist in its post-FOMC semantics,"" said Alan Ruskin at 4Cast, an economics research house. ""We had always felt that the change would come when it was fairly obvious that it should, and when the Fed had softened the blow, by alerting the market to such a change. As it was there was no such warning, and the sharp market reaction is testimony to just how far it caught asset markets 'off-side'."" Back in Europe, STMicroelectronics came under pressure after Europe's largest maker of microchips reported lower fourth-quarter profits after the close on Wednesday. The Franco-Italian group also cautioned that margins could continue to deteriorate and the shares fell 4.4 per cent to E21.91. More on STMicroelectronics ""This looks like a set of results that may disappoint aggressive investors expecting more of a cyclical recovery from Europe's premier semiconductor company,"" wrote Sean Murphy at Nomura in a note to clients. Nomura maintained its neutral rating on the stock. JP Morgan also retained its neutral rating on STMicro and pointed out that the chip group has now reported three consecutive quarter of earnings disappointment and highlighted the 17 per cent rise in sequential operating costs as a worry. Life assurers Axa and Allianz were among the biggest fallers after the two companies agreed to settle a lawsuit with Deutsche Bank over the World Trade Center attacks. Deutsche Bank filed a lawsuit against the two life assurers for $858m to cover the cost of replacing the building but the companies declined to give details of the settlement. Axa shares fell 3.9 per cent to E18.37, while Allianz was 2.6 per cent lower at E103.43. Swedish fashion retailer H&M rose in Stockholm despite reporting lower fourth quarter profits. For the September-to-November quarter the company said pre-tax profits fell to SKr3.27bn from SKr3.4bn a year ago but it said it would pay a bonus dividend to compensate investors and the shares moved 7.1 per cent higher to SKr182. Adidas-Salomon, the German sportswear maker, unveiled a 14 per cent rise in 2003 earnings despite slowing sales. The world's second largest sportswear maker said sales slipped to E6.27bn down from E6.5bn in 2002, but stripping out the effects of the stronger euro the company said it met its target of a 5 per cent sales rise. Despite this Adidas shares fell 2.4 per cent to E92.40. In the pharmaceutical sector, Aventis, the Franco-German group that is the takeover target of smaller rival Sanofi-Synthelabo, said its rival would have to increase its bid by at least 40-50 per cent to make it interesting. Late on Wednesday Aventis's management board unanimously rejected the hostile bid from Sanofi. Aventis shares gained 0.8 per cent to E61, while Sanofi's shares were 0.2 per cent lower at E55.45. "
557,1995-09-26,1995-09-27,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - CONFIDENCE RETURNS TO EQUITIES AFTER WALL ST RISE - MARKET REPORT.,"A confident performance by Wall Street overnight and again when US markets opened for business yesterday, plus healthy gains across international bond markets, saw UK equities make good progress. Dealers said that they expected no change in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy after yesterday's FOMC meeting. 'After the turbulence in the market over the past few sessions, the last thing the Fed would want is to see a small interest rate reduction trigger another bout of dollar weakness,' was the view of one trader. At the close of what dealers said was a difficult trading session, with marketmakers said to have been caught short of stock in many areas, the FT-SE 100 index ended at the day's high of 3,523.3 for a net gain of 16.3. The second-tier index, the Mid 250, kept pace with the 100 index, closing 15.1 higher at 3,931.6. Although there was an element of disappointment among traders at the level of activity in the market, there were strong hints that a number of domestic and overseas institutions have been moving cash into UK equities. That theory is borne out by the recent increase in the value of customer business in London. The value of customer activity in London on Monday came out at #1.61bn, the lowest figure for six trading session, but still well ahead of average value figures in recent weeks. Trading volume was 623.3m shares. The impressive showing by the Dow Industrial Average on Monday - it rallied from being around 20 points lower at the opening to stand some 5 points up on balance by the close - gave initial encouragement to UK equities, prompting marketmakers to open prices moderately higher. The FT-SE 100 kicked off some 8 points firmer and maintained its good form for the rest of the morning session, sustained by a modest but constant stream of buying orders. The afternoon brought more good news from the US with the Dow Jones Industrial Average putting on more than 25 points shortly after the opening, and bonds moving in the right direction ahead of the auction of two-year Treasury bonds. Economic data from the US showing a lower than expected consumer confidence index had little impact on markets. There were no great surprises in the day's corporate news, although Brent International, the chemicals group, was a serious casualty, after announcing a steep decline in interim profits and a dividend cut. Utilities stocks staged a strong rally, shrugging off the threat of a one-off windfall profits tax to be imposed by the Labour party if they win the next general election, and instead responding to the ever present chances of more bids from home and abroad. Swalec, East Midlands and Seeboard were all put forward as takeover targets, while Manweb continued to reflect the probability that a bid for the company from PacifiCorp is just around the corner. Another suggestion in the market yesterday was that Harrisons &Crosfield, the diversified group, could be about to bid for building products group Meyer International.

558,1995-09-26,1995-09-27,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - DAIWA BANK'S Y 110BN BOND LOSSES,"Hit futures prices. Tokyo Activity remained slack on the first trading day for October settlements, but share prices closed higher for the first time in five trading days on last minute technical buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average gained 355.55 or 2% at 17,921.98 after extremes of 17,595.32 and 17,921.98. Brokers, who had refrained from trading over the past week, resumed buying on the first trading day of settlements in the second half of the fiscal year. A rise in the futures market prompted arbitrage buying, and a last minute incursion by an overseas broker also helped the index. Volume totalled 220m shares, against 268m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 12.48 to 1,420.48 and the Nikkei 300 gained 2.88 or 1.1% at 266.29. Advances outscored declines by 648 to 349, with 176 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.72 at 1,218.02. In spite of the rise, traders expressed concern over large arbitrage positions. 'There are about 2.2bn shares in long arbitrage positions, and people are concerned about arbitrage unwinding,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Futures prices were hit briefly in the afternoon by an announcement by Daiwa Bank of its large losses stemming from bond trades. Trading of Daiwa Bank shares was suspended due to reports about its Y 110bn loss. Bank stocks were mixed. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y 20 to Y 2,920 and Fuji Bank gained Y 30 at Y 2,140, but Sumitomo Bank fell Y 30 to Y 1,870. A rally in drugs shares in overnight trading on Wall Street triggered buying in the sector. Takeda Chemical rose Y 10 to Y 1,380 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical added Y 30 at Y 2,110. Brokers were higher on active buying, the sector rising 2.7%. Nomura Securities climbed Y 60 to Y 1,930 and Nikko Securities Y 69 to Y 1,030. High-technology stocks gained ground on buybacks. Semiconductor shares saw Advantest up Y 460 to Y 5,790 and Tokyo Electron Y 260 better at Y 4,300. Electronics makers advanced, with Sharp ahead Y 10 at Y 1,370 and Matsushita Electric Industrial appreciating Y 20 to Y 1,480. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 89.58 to 19,165.42 in volume of 78.7m shares. Roundup Profit-taking left TAIPEI 1.3% down after Monday's 3.4% rally, but many brokers still saw a gradual uptrend developing. The weighted index receded 65.74 to 5,094.42. Turnover amounted to TDollars 44.2bn. Constructions and financials, which had impressive gains on Monday, were among the heaviest losers as profits were booked. Chang Ku Building, for instance, lost the daily maximum of 7% to TDollars 15.7 and Chinatrust suffered a drop of 90 cents to TDollars 40.7. HONG KONG decided that the market already reflected the consensus that the FOMC was unlikely to cut US rates later in the day and investors bought stocks selectively. The Hang Seng index picked up 85.46 to close at the day's high of 9,583.34 in turnover that improved to HKDollars 2.40bn. Brokers said the Hong Kong government's decision to put the brakes on its interest rate deregulation programme, after removing the cap on seven-day time deposits, was positive for banks. Hang Seng Bank moved ahead HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 64, Bank of East Asia gained 25 cents at HKDollars 24.70 and HSBC Holdings rose 50 cents to HKDollars 107. BOMBAY was again driven higher by widespread speculative buying triggered by expectations that carry-forward trading would be revived shortly. The BSE 30-share index ended 29.51 stronger at 3,518.11. Takeover activity brought a surge in Ahmedabad Electricity, up Rs 23 to Rs 140, after Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing said that it would petition the central government against the Securities and Exchange Board of India's decision last week rejecting its bid for AEC. A rival bid by the Torrent group was given the go-ahead. Bajaj Auto jumped Rs 30 to Rs 836 on speculative and foreign fund buying, on expectations of sharply higher first-half profits. SEOUL paid minimal attention to news that the government had passed its 1996 budget plan and shares finished easier as the consolidation in blue chips outweighed a late rebound focused on large asset shares. The composite index ended 1.35 lower at 983.85. KUALA LUMPUR was softer as activity continued to be led by second-liners, and the composite index closed 1.26 down at 1,011.67. Promet picked up 2 cents to M$3.16 on speculation that a prominent corporate buyer was accumulating the shares. Dealers noted that the rumours had been reinforced by the sale of large blocks of 3m to 5m shares in off-market transactions recently. Shares in the Renong group, including Faber and United Engineers, were down on talk that a proposal for a rise in tolls for its north-south expressway had not been approved. Renong fell 18 cents to M$4.50, United Engineers lost 50 cents at M$16.50 and Faber shed 7 cents to M$2.32. SYDNEY closed slightly lower ahead of the US FOMC meeting. The All Ordinaries index was off 2.1 at 2,128.60 after trading in a narrow range throughout the session. Turnover came to A$427.8m. BHP again led the actives, in turnover of A$62.24m, as it declined 6 cents to A$18.14. MANILA remained nervous about the possibility that inflation was increasing, while a fall in a number of blue chip stocks left the composite index below the 2,700 support level, down 35.04 or 1.3% at 2,683.55. The index hit an intra-day low of 2,667.43 before recouping some of its loss. WELLINGTON was supported by some bargain hunting which lifted the market off the session's lows by the close. The NZSE-40 Capital index shed 5.48 to 2,092.46 as turnover nearly doubled, although most brokers forecast that the current consolidation phase would continue. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
559,1995-09-26,1995-09-27,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW EASIER AFTER FOMC MEETING.,"Wall Street Blue chip shares slipped slightly and technology issues fell victim to a bigger sell-off in afternoon trading yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee concluded its meeting without lowering interest rates or issuing any statement, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.33 easier at 4,765.60, the more broadly based Standard &Poor's 500 lost 0.40 at 581.41 and the American Stock Exchange composite was down 1.85 at 542.53. New York SE volume came to 363.6m shares. Bonds moved higher in early trading after the Conference Board, a private economic think tank, said that its index of consumer confidence levels had fallen to 97.4 in September from 102. But in late trading, bonds were also mostly lower in the wake of the Fed's decision not to change monetary policy. Few economists believed that the Fed would lower interest rates at yesterday's FOMC meeting, but some expressed hope that the weak consumer confidence figures might spark the central bank to lower rates again in the near term. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite shed 8.10 to 1,038.05 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index slid more than 1% amid losses from some bellwether issues. Microsoft fell $2 to $88 1/4 and Dell Computers dropped $4 3/4 to $82 1/4. The Brooke Group gave up 18% or $2 1/8 to $9 1/4 to reverse most of the gain made yesterday and on Friday. The shares have more than doubled since late August, when New Valley, controlled by the Brooke Group, won permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to acquire up to 15% of RJR Nabisco. Late last week, the shares rose again on speculation that RJR might try to take over the Brooke Group or offer to buy back its shares at a premium in order to prevent a takeover attempt. Norand plunged more than 50% or $17 3/8 to $17 1/4 after reporting that it had lost $6.8m in the fourth quarter, primarily because of irregularities in its Italian subsidiary. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell $1 1/2 to $68 after the airline's baggage handling union voted against accepting a six-year contract. Biogen added $4 1/2 or 8% at $59 3/4 in the wake of news that a panel from the US Food and Drug Administration would meet to review a drug that the company was developing to treat multiple sclerosis. Canada Toronto stock prices closed flat for the second straight day, giving back early gains as the US Federal Reserve held its ground on interest rates. The TSE 300 composite index slipped 1.40 points to 4,519.90, while declining issues outnumbered advances by 425 to 366. Volume increased to 71.8m shares from Monday's 49.5m, while trading value was up to C$954m from C$678m. Stocks in both Canada and the US were up earlier in the session in quiet trading, as dealers stuck to the sidelines due to the Jewish Rosh Hashanah holiday and ahead of word from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

560,1995-09-26,1995-09-27,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR CONTINUES TO FIRM AHEAD OF FOMC MEETING.,"Foreign exchanges yesterday enjoyed a further day of relative calm following the frenetic activity seen last week. Trading was clearly inhibited by the meeting of the policy making open market committee of the US Federal Reserve. Although there was little expectation of a rate change, the risk was sufficient to encourage caution on the part of traders. The central banks were again absent from the market, perhaps in part due to the outside chance of a cut in US interest rates. The dollar continued its rally off recent lows, finishing at DM 1.4413, from DM 1.4278, and Y 101.1, from Y 99.65. In New York it ended at DM 1.4377 and Y 100.87. In Europe the policy discussion about monetary union continued, with a steady stream of bankers and politicians entering the fray. Speaking in Berlin, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, rejected any discussion of a delay in Emu, saying that the date and number of participants would be decided after a Maastricht-2 treaty had been agreed, probably in the first half of next year. The D-Mark continued to rally against the Swiss franc, but declined against other European currencies such as the French franc, Italian lira and Swedish krona. It finished at L1,115, from L1,133, against the lira, and at SKr4.865, from SKr4.920. The Swedish central bank was seen in the market supporting the krona. Sterling lost ground against the dollar, closing at $1.5689, from $1.5716, but was firmer against the D-Mark, finishing at DM 2.2612, from DM 2.2439. The message that emerges from the markets is that while last week's volatility is over for now, sentiment remains nervous, with the possibility of further turbulence not ruled out. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said: 'Sufficient damage has been done to Emu credibility that investors will be more cautious.' He said he suspected the equilibrium level of some European currencies had now changed, with investors likely to raise the risk premium required to hold them, and money market rates in these countries likely to rise. Mr Hawkins said that whereas the lira had looked like settling around L1,085 against the D-Mark, before last week's ructions, it now looked more likely to settle around L1,100 to L1,110. This view is endorsed by the economics team at Goldman Sachs in their latest Forex commentary, with the three and six-month forecasts for the lira adjusted to L1,100, from L1,080 and L1,090 previously. This view is not shared by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian prime minister, who said he thought the lira could 'return before long to the levels that it had before last week'. Mr Hawkins said that while a semblance of calm had returned to the markets, 'a sufficient chink in the Emu armour has been exposed that we probably will not return to the sort of quiet we had a few weeks ago'. A symptom of the easing currency tensions is the recovery of the D-Mark against the Swiss franc, assisted by comments from Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, that the franc was overvalued. Some analysts believe fair value is 85 to 90 centimes, compared to 81 now. With reasoning that is fairly typical of current market thinking, Goldman said it was now only 'modestly bullish' about the dollar over the next month or two. 'The lack of trade improvement, and of significant undervaluation, as well as a bumpy road for the efforts to reduce the budget deficit, suggest that the upside from here is limited.' It added: 'We do not view last week's sell-off as foreshadowing a renewed period of dollar weakness. Much has changed since the dollar's plunge in March. The US has indicated a renewed resolve to protect the value of the dollar; Japanese authorities have taken significant steps to break the yen bubble through massive intervention, monetary easing, and more fiscal stimulus in last week's supplementary budget; and interest rate surprises over the past few months have generally been in the dollar's favour.' The Bank of England provided #750m assistance towards clearing an #800m daily money market shortage. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 25/32% from 6 13/16%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
