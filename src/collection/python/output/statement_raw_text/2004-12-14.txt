The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for 
        the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent.
        The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary 
        policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth 
        in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output 
        appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy 
        prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation 
        and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
        The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment 
        of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters 
        to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively 
        low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at 
        a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will 
        respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation 
        to maintain price stability.
        Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; 
        Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger 
        W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; 
        Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.
