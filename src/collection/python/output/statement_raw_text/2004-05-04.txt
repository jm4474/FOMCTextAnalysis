FRB: Press Release--FOMC statement--May 4, 2004
Release Date: May 4, 2004
For immediate release
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for
the federal funds rate at 1 percent.
The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary
policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing
important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated
over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand
at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up. Although incoming
inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations
appear to have remained well contained.
The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment
of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. Similarly,
the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance. At this
juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes
that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be
measured.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy actions were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman;
Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger
W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn;
Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.
