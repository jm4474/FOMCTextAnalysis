Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and 
Communication Practices  
Participants continued to discuss issues related to the 
ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy 
strategy, tools, and communication practices.  The staff 
summarized the feedback received through the Fed Lis-
tens initiative, a series of 14 public-facing events con-
ducted around the country with a broad range of indi-
viduals and groups.  These events engaged with the pub-
lic directly on issues pertaining to the dual-mandate ob-
jectives of maximum employment and stable prices.  
Representatives from underserved communities who 
participated in the Fed Listens events generally saw the 
current strong labor market as providing significant ben-
efits to their communities, most notably by creating

outlook.

greater opportunities for individuals who have experi-
enced difficulty finding jobs in the past.  Nevertheless, 
these representatives noted that the benefits from cur-
rent labor market conditions flowing to people in their 
communities were less than those implied by national 
statistics, and they expressed concerns that the recent 
gains might not be sustained in the event of an economic 
downturn.  Business representatives reported experienc-
ing challenges finding qualified workers and described 
several initiatives to attract and retain workers, including 
training programs and a willingness to employ individu-
als who are unlikely to have been considered in less fa-
vorable labor market conditions.  Inflation develop-
ments elicited fewer comments at these events and were 
generally seen as posing less of a challenge than labor 
market conditions.  Representatives of retirees men-
tioned difficulties associated with the rising costs of 
health care and prescription drugs, whereas those repre-
senting low- and middle-income communities pointed 
to the rising costs of basic necessities such as housing, 
utilities, and food.  Business representatives emphasized 
the importance of low and stable inflation for planning 
and decisionmaking.  Event participants were concerned 
about rising costs of living and generally perceived low 
inflation as desirable from that perspective.  Event par-
ticipants were asked about monetary policymakers’ con-
cerns regarding overall inflation running persistently be-
low 2 percent; they noted that the Federal Reserve could 
better communicate its reasons for these concerns.  
When asked about the effects of changes in interest 
rates, representatives of underserved communities said 
that such changes had little effect on many members of 
their communities who have limited or no access to 
credit.  Representatives of retirees conveyed a more neg-
ative view of low interest rates, given the greater reliance 
of wealthier retirees on interest income.  Business repre-
sentatives generally found the low interest rate environ-
ment beneficial. 

The staff briefing also included an analysis of distribu-
tional considerations for monetary policy.  Consistent 
with the feedback received at the Fed Listens events, the 
evidence reviewed by the staff showed that workers who 
are young, less educated, African American, or Hispanic 
tend to face a greater-than-average risk of losing their 
jobs during recessions.  The staff used simulations from 
a specific macroeconomic model to explore how heter-
ogeneity of households might affect the transmission of 
economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the 
economy.  The staff’s simulations embedded the as-
sumption that households have limited ability to borrow, 
which makes some households’ consumption spending 
more sensitive to changes in income.  As a result, in 

these simulations, downturns lead to larger contractions 
in aggregate demand than would be the case if all house-
holds could borrow to support their consumption 
spending in response to a loss in income.  The amplifi-
cation of recessionary shocks was especially large when 
the monetary policy response was constrained by the ef-
fective lower bound (ELB) on the policy interest rate.  
Overall, the analysis suggested that the costs of reces-
sions, as well as the benefits of economic stabilization, 
might be larger than suggested by models that did not 
account for differences across households regarding 
their access to credit. 

Participants agreed that the Fed Listens outreach efforts 
had informed their understanding of the goals and 
tradeoffs associated with monetary policy and had pro-
vided highly useful input into their deliberations.  Several 
participants voiced their desire to continue the conver-
sations initiated at the Fed Listens events.  Participants 
also shared their appreciation of the feedback they re-
ceive on a regular basis from members of the public, in-
cluding through the Federal Reserve System’s extensive 
networks of contacts and community outreach efforts.  
A few participants emphasized that policymakers’ en-
gagement with the public helps build trust, fosters trans-
parency, and reinforces the credibility of the Federal Re-
serve.   

Participants generally saw the feedback from Fed Listens 
events as reinforcing the importance of sustaining the 
economic expansion so that the effects of a persistently 
strong job market reach more of those who, in the past, 
had experienced difficulty finding employment.  Several 
participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor mar-
ket conditions helps workers build skills and cement 
their attachment to the labor force in a manner that 
might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns 
and might increase the maximum sustainable level of 
employment over the longer run.  A number of partici-
pants also emphasized that sustaining strong labor mar-
ket conditions is helpful for meeting the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. 

Some participants spoke to some of the challenges asso-
ciated with assessing the maximum level of employment.  
A few participants noted that aggregate statistics mask 
significant heterogeneity in labor market outcomes.  A 
few others pointed to the continued absence of signifi-
cant wage and price pressure—traditionally seen as a 
symptom of a tight labor market—even as the unem-
ployment rate had moved below most estimates of its 
longer-run level.  A few participants raised the possibility 
that the maximum sustainable level of employment had

increased as the expansion continued to draw workers 
who would otherwise not be in the labor force. 

Regarding inflation, participants recognized that seg-
ments of the public generally do not regard the fact that 
aggregate inflation is running modestly below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent goal as a problem.  A few participants 
noted that the public’s view on this issue was under-
standable from the perspective of households and busi-
nesses going about their daily lives in an economy with 
low and stable inflation.  That said, a couple of partici-
pants cautioned that inflation could emerge as a concern 
among members of the public if it became more volatile 
or ran at levels substantially away from the Committee’s 
goal.  Many participants also warned about the macro-
economic consequences of not achieving 2 percent on a 
sustained basis.  In particular, if inflation ran persistently 
below the Committee’s objective, longer-term inflation 
expectations could drift down, resulting in lower actual 
inflation.  With lower inflation, nominal interest rates 
would be lower as well and therefore closer to the ELB.  
As a result, the scope for monetary policy to support the 
economy in a future downturn through interest rate cuts 
would be reduced, a situation that would likely worsen 
economic outcomes for households and businesses.  In 
light of these considerations, participants generally 
agreed that they need to communicate more clearly to 
the public their rationale for, and commitment to, 
achieving 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis and of 
ensuring that longer-run inflation expectations are an-
chored at levels consistent with this objective.  To ensure 
the effectiveness of these and other communications, 
several participants stressed that the Federal Reserve 
needs to adapt its communications to various audiences.  
A few participants emphasized that communications 
about the Committee’s resolve to return inflation to 
2 percent need to be backed with actions and results to 
ensure that the public sees these communications as 
credible.  

With respect to the role of distributional considerations 
in the pursuit of the dual-mandate objectives, several 
participants noted that it was important for policymakers 
to be cognizant of how monetary policy affects different 
segments of the population.  Most participants com-
mented on the large costs that recessions and high un-
employment impose on communities, notably on their 
most vulnerable constituents, and stressed the need for 
monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first 
place or reduce their severity when they occur.  A num-
ber of these participants emphasized that, while mone-
tary policy actions can have different effects across 
groups, monetary policy actions that are driven by the 

pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices ulti-
mately benefit all groups.  Participants viewed the role 
of monetary policy as supporting a strong, stable econ-
omy that benefits all Americans.  Various participants 
noted that monetary policy is a blunt instrument whose 
effects cannot be targeted to specific communities.  Sev-
eral participants remarked that while monetary policy ac-
tions can improve the conditions of vulnerable commu-
nities, notably by supporting a strong job market, these 
actions may not reduce inequality in wealth and income.  
For these and other reasons, many participants empha-
sized that policies other than monetary policy are appro-
priate to directly address inequality.  In addition, a couple 
of participants cautioned that maintaining accommoda-
tive financial conditions could be counterproductive if 
doing so fueled financial imbalances and exacerbated the 
next economic downturn.  

Participants agreed that their review of monetary policy 
strategy, tools, and communication practices would con-
tinue at future meetings and, as a result, that the Com-
mittee would not reaffirm its existing Statement on 
Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy at the 
January 2020 meeting.  The Committee plans to revisit 
this statement closer to the conclusion of the review, 
likely around the middle of 2020. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The System Open Market Account manager first re-
viewed developments in financial markets over the inter-
meeting period.  Market prices appeared to respond 
mainly to signs of stabilization in the U.S. and global 
economies and to developments associated with trade 
policy.  Market participants noted some risks to the out-
look including Brexit and geopolitical factors. 

Regarding expectations for U.S. monetary policy, the 
Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys and market-based 
indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of 
no change in the target range for the federal funds rate 
at this meeting.  The expected path of the federal funds 
rate implied by the medians of survey respondents’ 
modal forecasts remained essentially flat through 2020.  
Survey- and market-implied uncertainty about the near-
term outlook for monetary policy declined, with market 
commentary attributing the decrease in part to the Com-
mittee’s October communications.  Survey respondents 
placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target 
range over 2020 than an increase. 

The manager turned next to a review of money market 
developments since the October meeting, starting with 
an update on the implementation of the Committee’s

strategy to ensure ample reserves.  Reserve management 
purchases of Treasury bills continued at a pace of 
$60 billion per month, with propositions remaining 
strong and little discernible effect on market function-
ing.  While these purchases accumulated, the Desk con-
tinued to conduct regular repurchase agreement (repo) 
operations in order to maintain reserves at or above the 
level that prevailed in early September.  Repos outstand-
ing from these Desk operations totaled roughly $215 bil-
lion per day, consisting of both overnight and term op-
erations.   

As reserve levels increased, the distribution of reserves 
across bank types became comparable with where it was 
in early September.  The federal funds rate and other 
overnight money market rates fell modestly and were 
close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate for 
most of the period.  The intraday dispersion of rates was 
also lower than when reserves were at similar levels be-
fore September.  In addition to helping keep reserves 
ample, repo operations likely have reduced pressures in 
money markets and the dispersion in money market 
rates. 

With respect to conditions around year-end, the man-
ager noted that forward measures of market pricing con-
tinued to indicate expectations of temporary upward 
pressures on some secured rates.  Money market rates 
are often volatile around year-end, and Federal Reserve 
operations are not intended to eliminate all year-end 
pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply re-
mains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures 
could adversely affect the implementation of monetary 
policy.  The Desk had already conducted three longer-
term repo operations spanning year-end—for a total of 
$75 billion—and planned to announce an additional 
longer-term operation, as well as increase the amount of 
overnight repo offered around the year-end date.  The 
manager reported that the Desk is closely monitoring re-
serves and money market conditions and that it is pre-
pared to adjust plans as needed.  

The manager discussed two operational considerations 
around policy implementation.  The first involved the 
risk that future Treasury bill purchases could have a 
larger effect on liquidity in the Treasury bill market in 
light of expected seasonal declines in bill issuance and 
the Federal Reserve’s growing ownership share of out-
standing bills.  If this risk were to materialize, the Federal 
Reserve could consider expanding the universe of secu-
rities purchased for reserve management purposes to in-
clude coupon-bearing Treasury securities with a short 
time to maturity.  Purchases of these short-dated securi-
ties would not affect broader financial conditions or the 

stance of monetary policy.  The manager also discussed 
expectations to gradually transition away from active 
repo operations next year as Treasury bill purchases sup-
ply a larger base of reserves.  The calendar of repo oper-
ations starting in mid-January could reflect a gradual re-
duction in active repo operations.  The manager indi-
cated that some repos might be needed at least through 
April, when tax payments will sharply reduce reserve lev-
els.  

As reserves remain ample, the manager noted that it may 
become appropriate at some point to implement a tech-
nical adjustment to the IOER rate and the offered rate 
on overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreements.  
Should conditions warrant this adjustment, the IOER 
rate could move closer to the middle of the target range 
for the federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate could 
be realigned with the bottom of the target range.   

The manager also noted that the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York communicated to its customers that the 
remuneration rate on the foreign repo pool will be re-
vised to be generally equivalent to the overnight reverse 
repo rate.  This action may reduce activity in the pool to 
some extent and increase the level of reserves.   

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the December 10–11 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained 
strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) was 
increasing at a moderate rate in the second half of 2019.  
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month 
percentage change in the price index for personal con-
sumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 per-
cent in October.  Survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations were little changed. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in Novem-
ber, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who 
had previously been on strike in October.  The average 
pace of job gains over the three months ending in No-
vember, which is unaffected by the strike, was stronger 
than earlier in 2019.  However, the rate of increase in 
payrolls so far this year was slower than last year, even 
accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employ-
ment, which will be incorporated in the published data 
in February 2020.  The unemployment rate ticked up in 
October but then moved back down to its 50-year low

of 3.5 percent in November; the labor force participa-
tion rate and the employment-to-population ratio held 
steady, on balance, over those two months.  The unem-
ployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispan-
ics, and whites were little changed, on net, over the past 
two months; the unemployment rate for each group was 
below its level at the end of the previous economic ex-
pansion, though persistent differentials between these 
rates remained.  The average share of workers employed 
part time for economic reasons in November stayed be-
low its level in late 2007.  Both the rate of private-sector 
job openings and the rate of quits edged down in Sep-
tember, but these readings were still at fairly elevated lev-
els.  The four-week moving average of initial claims for 
unemployment insurance benefits through late Novem-
ber remained near historically low levels.  In general, re-
cent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be 
moderate.  Total labor compensation per hour in the 
business sector increased 3.7 percent over the four quar-
ters ending in the third quarter.  The employment cost 
index for private-sector workers rose 2.7 percent over 
the 12 months ending in September, while average 
hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent 
over the 12 months ending in November. 

Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price 
index, increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending 
in October.  Core PCE price inflation (which excludes 
changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 
1.6 percent over that same 12-month period, while con-
sumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation 
and consumer energy prices declined.  The trimmed 
mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con-
structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained 
at 2 percent in October.  The consumer price index 
(CPI) rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in No-
vember, while core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent.  Re-
cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations—including those from the Uni-
versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey 
of Professional Forecasters, the Survey of Consumer 
Expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Sur-
vey of Market Participants—were little changed, on bal-
ance; the Michigan survey measure ticked back down in 
early December to the bottom of its recent range after 
ticking up in November. 

Real PCE continued to expand in October following a 
strong gain in the third quarter.  Sales of light motor ve-
hicles rose markedly in November.  Key factors that in-
fluence consumer spending—including the low unem-

ployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable in-
come, high levels of households’ net worth, and gener-
ally low interest rates—were supportive of solid real 
PCE growth in the near term.  The Michigan survey 
measure of consumer sentiment rose again in early De-
cember to an upbeat level and had more than recovered 
from its drop in August; the Conference Board survey 
measure of consumer confidence remained at a favora-
ble level in November. 

Real residential investment appeared to be increasing 
further after rising solidly in the third quarter.  Both 
starts and building permit issuance for single-family 
homes increased in October, and starts of multifamily 
units also rose.  Existing home sales continued to in-
crease in October, although new home sales edged down 
following a solid gain in the third quarter.  All told, the 
data on construction and sales continued to suggest that 
the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 has been 
boosting housing activity. 

Real nonresidential private fixed investment remained 
weak overall after declining in the second and third quar-
ters.  Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft increased solidly in Oc-
tober following a string of decreases, although many for-
ward-looking indicators pointed to continued softness in 
business equipment spending.  Most measures of busi-
ness sentiment were still downbeat, analysts’ expecta-
tions of firms’ longer-term profit growth edged down 
further, and concerns about trade developments contin-
ued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions.  Nominal 
business expenditures for nonresidential structures out-
side of the drilling and mining sector continued to de-
cline in October, and the total number of crude oil and 
natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business 
spending for structures in the drilling and mining sec-
tor—fell further through early December. 

Industrial production decreased in October and re-
mained notably lower than at the beginning of the year.  
Production in October continued to be held down by 
the strike at General Motors, although the end of the 
strike and automakers’ schedules suggested that assem-
blies of light motor vehicles would rebound in Novem-
ber.  Overall manufacturing production appeared likely 
to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally 
weak readings on new orders from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business in-
vestment, slow economic growth abroad, and a persis-
tent drag from trade developments.

Total real government purchases were increasing slowly 
in the fourth quarter.  Nominal defense spending in Oc-
tober pointed to only a modest rise in real federal gov-
ernment purchases.  Real purchases by state and local 
governments looked to be moving roughly sideways; 
state and local payrolls expanded modestly, on net, over 
October and November, and nominal construction 
spending by these governments was about flat in Octo-
ber. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in 
October.  Exports fell a little, with declines in all export 
categories except for services and industrial supplies.  
Imports fell much more, and the declines were broad 
based, with the largest contributions coming from im-
ports of consumer goods and automotive products.  
Available trade data suggested that the contribution of 
net exports to real GDP growth, which was slightly neg-
ative in the third quarter, would turn somewhat positive 
in the fourth quarter.  

Foreign economic growth slowed further in the third 
quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufac-
turing sector.  Recent monthly indicators pointed to a 
stabilization in the pace of economic growth in China 
and several advanced foreign economies.  However, 
other indicators suggested that social unrest weighed 
heavily on economic activity in several countries, most 
notably in Hong Kong, and that weakness persisted in 
parts of Latin America.  Foreign inflation picked up 
somewhat as energy prices stabilized, although inflation 
remained relatively low in most foreign economies. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investor sentiment fluctuated over the intermeeting pe-
riod largely in response to ongoing trade negotiations be-
tween the United States and China.  On net, equity prices 
increased moderately while corporate bond spreads nar-
rowed slightly.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities 
were little changed.  Financing conditions for businesses 
and households remained supportive of spending and 
economic activity. 

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting 
period were viewed as suggesting that additional near-
term changes to the target range for the federal funds 
rate were less likely than had previously been expected.  
A straight read of the probability distribution for the fed-
eral funds rate implied by options prices suggested that 
investors assigned a high probability to the target range 
remaining unchanged at the December FOMC meeting.  
Forward rates implied by overnight index swap quotes 
declined slightly, on net, and implied about a 25 basis 
point decline in the federal funds rate by the end of 2020. 

Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeet-
ing period but, on net, the Treasury curve was little 
changed.  Measures of inflation compensation over the 
next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury 
Inflation-Protected Securities increased slightly from 
near multiyear low levels. 

Broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the 
intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed 
to trade-related developments and stronger-than- 
expected U.S. employment reports.  Option-implied vol-
atility on the S&P 500 index increased modestly but re-
mained near the low end of its historical distribution.  
On net, corporate credit spreads narrowed slightly. 

Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Interest rates for over-
night secured and unsecured loans fell in line with the 
25 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal 
funds rate at the October FOMC meeting.  Trading in 
money markets was orderly, with volumes in normal 
ranges and spreads narrower relative to the IOER rate.  
Pressures on rates at October month-end and Novem-
ber mid-month—both days with sizable settlements of 
Treasury auctions—were muted compared with other 
recent Treasury issuance days.  The Desk’s open market 
operations aimed at maintaining ample reserves pro-
ceeded smoothly. 

As in U.S. markets, sentiment in foreign financial mar-
kets fluctuated in response to news on U.S.–China trade 
negotiations.  Most foreign equity price indexes and 
long-term sovereign yields in Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and Japan increased modestly on net.  The 
broad dollar index ended the period little changed.  Po-
litical unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America garnered 
some financial market attention and led to a weakening 
of some Latin American currencies, notably the Chilean 
peso, but the imprint on broader financial markets was 
limited.  

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re-
mained accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate 
bonds was robust, on average, in October and Novem-
ber.  Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans re-
mained near recent monthly averages.  Meanwhile, com-
mercial and industrial loans held by banks contracted in 
October but increased modestly in November.  The 
credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated 
slightly in recent months but remained solid overall.  Af-
ter particularly strong gross equity issuance in Septem-
ber, initial public offerings declined and seasoned offer-
ings remained solid in October and November.  Credit

conditions for both small businesses and municipalities 
stayed accommodative. 

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions also remained generally accommodative.  
Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period 
but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range.  
Agency and non-agency CMBS issuance increased in 
October to a post-crisis high.  CRE loan growth at banks 
also increased in October relative to recent quarters. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
remained accommodative over the intermeeting period.  
Mortgage rates were little changed since the October 
FOMC meeting.  Consistent with this year’s decline in 
mortgage rates, home-purchase originations and refi-
nancing originations both rose.  Mortgage credit stand-
ards were little changed.    

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally supportive of growth in consumer 
spending, although conditions continued to be tight for 
nonprime borrowers.  Auto loans increased, consistent 
with significant declines in auto loan interest rates this 
year.  Credit card debt grew at a solid pace, and interest 
rates on credit card debt began to fall.  Consumer  
asset-backed securities issuance was strong through Oc-
tober as spreads stabilized at levels that were somewhat 
above their post-crisis averages. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by 
the staff for the December FOMC meeting was revised 
up a little for the second half of 2019 relative to the pre-
vious projection.  This revision primarily reflected in-
coming data for household spending and business in-
vestment that were somewhat stronger than expected.  
Even with this upward revision, real GDP was forecast 
to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in 
the first half, mostly because of continued soft business 
investment and slower increases in government spend-
ing.  The forecast for real GDP growth over the medium 
term was also revised up a bit, on balance, primarily in 
response to a somewhat higher projected path for equity 
prices.  Nevertheless, real GDP growth was still ex-
pected to slow modestly in the coming years, largely be-
cause of a fading boost from fiscal policy.  Output was 
forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s esti-
mate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 
and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output 
growth in 2022.  The unemployment rate was projected 
to be roughly flat at around its current level through 

2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its 
longer-run natural rate.   

The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2019 
was revised down a bit, as a downward revision to core 
PCE prices in response to recent data was partly offset 
by an upward revision to consumer energy prices.  Be-
yond 2019, core inflation was expected to be above its 
pace this year, and this projection was revised up a touch 
because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the 
current forecast.  The projection for total inflation in 
2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a 
projected decline in consumer energy prices.  Over the 
remainder of the medium-term projection, total inflation 
was expected to be about the same as core inflation, al-
though both inflation measures were forecast to con-
tinue to run a bit below 2 percent through 2022. 

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of 
the past 20 years.  The staff viewed the downside risks 
to economic activity as having eased a bit since the pre-
vious forecast but still judged that the risks to the fore-
cast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, 
with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unem-
ployment rate.  Important factors influencing this assess-
ment were that international trade tensions and foreign 
economic developments seemed more likely to move in 
directions that could have significant negative effects on 
the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than 
assumed.  In addition, softness in business investment 
and manufacturing production so far this year were seen 
as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slow-
ing in economic growth than the staff projected.  The 
risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as hav-
ing a downward skew, in part because of the downside 
risks to the forecast for economic activity. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections are described

in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which 
is an addendum to these minutes. 

Participants agreed that the labor market had remained 
strong over the intermeeting period and that economic 
activity had risen at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been 
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had remained low.  Although household 
spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in-
vestment and exports had remained weak.  On a  
12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items 
other than food and energy were running below 2 per-
cent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation 
remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations were little changed. 

Participants generally expected sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes.  This outlook re-
flected, at least in part, the support provided by the cur-
rent stance of monetary policy.  Nevertheless, global de-
velopments, related to both persistent uncertainty re-
garding international trade and weakness in economic 
growth abroad, continued to pose some risks to the out-
look, and inflation pressures remained muted. 

In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
agreed that spending had increased at a strong pace.  
They generally expected that consumption spending 
would likely remain on a firm footing, supported by 
strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and solid 
consumer confidence.  In addition, residential invest-
ment had continued to pick up, reflecting, in part, the 
effects of lower mortgage rates.  Many participants com-
mented that business contacts in consumer-related in-
dustries reported strong demand or that contacts were 
optimistic about the holiday retail spending season.  
However, some participants observed that recent data 
on retail sales or motor vehicle spending had decelerated 
slightly. 

With respect to the business sector, participants saw 
trade developments and concerns about the global eco-
nomic growth outlook as the main factors contributing 
to weak business investment and exports.  Participants 
generally expected these factors to continue to damp 
business investment and exports.  They expressed simi-
lar concerns about activity in manufacturing industries.  
A few participants noted that the current weakness in 
capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of 
productivity growth in future years.  A few others ob-
served that businesses were diversifying their supply 
chains or investing in technology to adapt to persistent 

uncertainty regarding international trade, which might 
mitigate the effects of such uncertainty on future busi-
ness spending.   

A number of participants commented on challenges fac-
ing the energy and agriculture sectors.  A few partici-
pants remarked that activity in the energy sector was es-
pecially weak, reflecting low petroleum prices, low prof-
itability, and tight financing conditions for energy- 
producing firms.  Several participants noted that the ag-
ricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties, in-
cluding those associated with trade developments, weak 
export demand, and challenging financial positions for 
many farmers.  A couple of participants noted that farm 
subsidies from the federal government were offsetting a 
portion of the financial strain on farmers. 

Participants judged that conditions in the labor market 
remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a  
50-year low, job gains remaining solid, and some 
measures of labor force participation increasing further.  
The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going 
forward, and various participants remarked that there 
were some indications that further strengthening in 
overall labor market conditions was possible without 
creating undesirable pressures on resources.  In particu-
lar, a number of participants noted that the labor force 
participation rate could rise further still.  Moreover, 
measures of wage growth had generally remained mod-
erate.  However, a few participants commented that in-
creases in the labor force would likely moderate as slack 
in the labor market diminished.  In addition, a couple of 
participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark 
revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics had indicated that payroll employment gains 
would likely show less momentum coming into this year 
once those revisions are incorporated in published data 
early next year.  A couple of other participants thought 
it was important to better understand the quality of jobs 
being created.  Business contacts in many Districts indi-
cated continued strong labor demand, with firms report-
ing difficulties in finding qualified workers or broaden-
ing their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized 
groups.  A number of participants noted that wage pres-
sures were evident for some industries in their Districts, 
and a couple of participants commented that firms were 
responding to those pressures in a variety of ways, in-
cluding investing in technology that could serve as a sub-
stitute for labor.    

In their discussion of inflation developments, partici-
pants noted that recent readings on overall and core 
PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis, 
had continued to run below 2 percent.  Survey-based

measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed, and market-based measures of inflation 
compensation remained low.  A few participants com-
mented on factors that may temporarily exert upward 
pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming 
months.  Assessing all these factors, participants gener-
ally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent 
objective as the economic expansion continued and re-
source utilization remained high.  However, weakness 
abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited 
as sources of risk to this assessment.  Participants who 
expressed less confidence that inflation would return 
promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that in-
flation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past 
several years even as resource utilization had increased 
or that global or technology-related factors were exerting 
downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult 
to overcome.   

Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook 
for economic activity.  While many saw the risks as tilted 
somewhat to the downside, some risks were seen to have 
eased over recent months.  In particular, there were 
some tentative signs that trade tensions with China were 
easing, and the probability of a no-deal Brexit was judged 
to have lessened further.  In addition, there were indica-
tions that the prospects for global economic growth may 
be stabilizing.  A number of participants observed that 
the domestic economy was showing resilience in the face 
of headwinds from global developments.  Moreover, sta-
tistical models designed to gauge the probability of re-
cession using financial market data, including those 
based on information from the Treasury yield curve, 
suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring 
over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent 
months.  However, new uncertainties had emerged re-
garding trade policy with Argentina, Brazil, and France, 
and political tensions in Hong Kong persisted. 

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants judged that it would be appropriate to main-
tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 
1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.  As 
reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded 
the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain 
appropriate for a time as long as incoming information 
about the economy remained broadly consistent with the 
economic outlook.  Of course, if developments emerged 
that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, the 
stance of policy would need to adjust in a way that fos-
tered the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives.      

A number of participants agreed that maintaining the 
current stance of monetary policy would give the Com-
mittee some time to assess the full effects on the econ-
omy of its policy decisions and communications over the 
course of this year along with other information bearing 
on the economic outlook.  Participants also discussed 
how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time 
could be helpful for cushioning the economy from the 
global developments that have been weighing on eco-
nomic activity and for returning inflation to the Com-
mittee’s symmetric objective of 2 percent.  Participants 
generally expressed concerns regarding inflation contin-
uing to fall short of 2 percent.  Although a number of 
participants noted that some of the factors currently 
holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory, 
various participants were concerned that indicators were 
suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expec-
tations was too low.  

A few participants raised the concern that keeping inter-
est rates low over a long period might encourage exces-
sive risk-taking, which could exacerbate imbalances in 
the financial sector.  These participants offered various 
perspectives on the relationship between financial stabil-
ity and policies that keep interest rates persistently low.  
They remarked that such policies could be inconsistent 
with sustaining maximum employment, could make the 
next recession more severe than otherwise, or could 
strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential 
tools to guard against emerging imbalances. 

Various participants remarked on issues related to the 
implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics 
for further discussion at future meetings.  Among the 
topics mentioned were the potential role of a standing 
repo facility in an ample-reserves regime, the setting of 
administered rates, and the composition of the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities over the longer 
run.   

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members noted that information received since the 
FOMC met in October indicated that the labor market 
remained strong and that economic activity had been ris-
ing at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been solid, on av-
erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had 
remained low.  Although household spending had been 
rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and ex-
ports remained weak.  On a 12-month basis, overall in-
flation and inflation for items other than food and en-
ergy were running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low;

survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed.  

Members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent.  Members judged 
that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate 
to support sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.   

Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and 
size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and 
expected economic conditions relative to its maximum 
employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objective.  And they concurred that this assessment 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to state that they judged that “the current stance 
of monetary policy is appropriate” to support the 
achievement of the Committee’s policy objectives.  
Members discussed their options regarding references to 
global developments and muted inflation pressures in 
the statement.  In their judgment, these factors, cited in 
previous postmeeting statements as part of the rationale 
for adjusting the stance of policy, remained salient fea-
tures of the outlook.  Accordingly, they agreed to cite 
them in the sentence indicating that “the Committee will 
continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor-
mation for the economic outlook.”  With the retention 
of these references to global developments and muted 
inflation pressures, members agreed that the text on un-
certainties about the outlook could be removed.  A few 
members suggested that the language stating that mone-
tary policy would support inflation “near” 2 percent 
could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers 
were comfortable with inflation running below that 
level; they preferred language that referred to returning 
inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive.  Other members thought that the reference to 
“near” 2 percent was intended to encompass modest de-
viations of inflation above and below 2 percent.  

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective December 12, 2019, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.  In light of recent 
and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s 
non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs 
the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills 
at least into the second quarter of 2020 to main-
tain over time ample reserve balances at or 
above the level that prevailed in early September 
2019.  The Committee also directs the Desk to 
continue conducting term and overnight repur-
chase agreement operations at least through 
January 2020 to ensure that the supply of re-
serves remains ample even during periods of 
sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to 
mitigate the risk of money market pressures that 
could adversely affect policy implementation.  
In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to 
conduct overnight reverse repurchase opera-
tions (and reverse repurchase operations with 
maturities of more than one day when necessary 
to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar 
trading conventions) at an offering rate of 
1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the 
value of Treasury securities held outright in the 
System Open Market Account that are available 
for such operations and by a per-counterparty 
limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury 
securities and to continue reinvesting all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.  Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in Treasury securities to roughly match 
the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal

Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in October indicates 
that the labor market remains strong and that 
economic activity has been rising at a moderate 
rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate has 
remained low.  Although household spending 
has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed 
investment and exports remain weak.  On a 
12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation 
for items other than food and energy are run-
ning below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expec-
tations are little changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee decided to 
maintain the target range for the federal funds 
rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent.  The Committee 
judges that the current stance of monetary pol-
icy is appropriate to support sustained expan-
sion of economic activity, strong labor market 
conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  The Committee 
will continue to monitor the implications of in-
coming information for the economic outlook, 
including global developments and muted infla-
tion pressures, as it assesses the appropriate 
path of the target range for the federal funds 
rate. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of

information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James 
Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. 
George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric S. Rosengren. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-
changed at 1.55 percent and voted unanimously to ap-
prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex-
isting level of 2.25 percent, effective December 12, 
2019. 

Organizational Matters 
By unanimous vote, Lorie K. Logan was selected to 
serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager, Sys-
tem Open Market Account, on the understanding that 
her selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of New York.  

Secretary’s note:  Advice subsequently was re-
ceived that the selection of Ms. Logan as man-
ager was satisfactory to the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 28–29, 
2020.  The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on Decem-
ber 11, 2019. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on November 19, 2019, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on October 29–30, 2019.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 10–11, 2019, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run.  
Each participant’s projections were based on infor-
mation available at the time of the meeting, together with 
his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-
run value—and assumptions about other factors likely 
to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the 
value to which each variable would be expected to con-
verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and 
in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Ap-
propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos-
ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that 
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the 
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability.   

Almost all participants expected that, under appropriate 
monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2020 would run 
at or slightly above 1.9 percent, the median of current 
estimates of its longer-run rate.  The median of the pro-
jections for the growth rate of real GDP edges down 
each year over the projection horizon and, for 2022, is 
modestly below the median of the current estimates of 
its longer-run rate.  The median of the current projec-
tions for the unemployment rate was lower than that in 
the September Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) for each year of the projection period, and some 
participants reduced their estimates of the longer-run 
normal rate of unemployment, resulting in a slight de-
cline in the median estimate.  The medians of the pro-
jections for both total and core inflation, as measured by 
the four-quarter percent change in the price index for 
personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increase sig-
nificantly from 2019 to 2020 and more modestly in 2021 
to reach 2 percent that year.  Almost all participants ex-
pected that inflation would be at or slightly above the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021 and 2022.  A 
couple more participants, relative to the September SEP, 
projected inflation to exceed 2 percent at some point 

                                                            
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate. 

during the projection period.  The medians of the pro-
jections for both total and core inflation were unchanged 
for 2020 through 2022, compared with the September 
SEP.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics 
for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, a substantial majority of partici-
pants indicated that their expectations regarding the evo-
lution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s ob-
jectives of maximum employment and 2 percent infla-
tion, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds at its 
current level through the end of 2020.  Compared with 
the September SEP submissions, the median projection 
for the federal funds rate was 25 basis points lower in 
each year over the projection period and retained its 
modest upward tilt in 2021 and 2022.  The median of 
participants’ assessments of the appropriate level for the 
federal funds rate in 2022 was slightly below the median 
of estimates of its longer-run level; the median estimate 
of the longer-run level was unchanged from its value in 
the September SEP.   

Most participants regarded the uncertainties around 
their projections as broadly similar to the average over 
the past 20 years.  The majority of participants continued 
to assess the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth 
as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment 
rate as weighted to the upside.  However, compared with 
the September submissions, several participants shifted 
their assessments of the balance of risks around these 
projections to being broadly balanced.  Most participants 
judged the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly bal-
anced, though one-third of participants viewed the risks 
to their inflation projections as weighted to the down-
side; no participant assessed the risks to his or her infla-
tion outlook as weighted to the upside.  The uncertain-
ties and risks around participants’ projections for head-
line and core inflation were little changed from the Sep-
tember SEP.  

The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemploy-
ment 
As shown in table 1, the medians of participants’ projec-
tions for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020, conditional 
on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary 
policy, were 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, a 
touch above the median estimate of the longer-run

growth rate of 1.9 percent.  The median of the projec-
tions for the growth rate of real GDP declines slowly 
over the projection horizon and, in 2022, is modestly be-
low the median of the current estimates of its longer-run 
rate.  The medians of the projections for real GDP 
growth in all four years of the projection period, as well 
as in the longer run, were unchanged from the Septem-
ber SEP.  

A majority of participants marked down their projec-
tions of the unemployment rate in each year of the pro-
jection period, and some participants lowered their esti-
mates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  
As a result, the medians of the projections for the unem-
ployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 through 
2022 were 3.5 percent, 3.6 percent, and 3.7 percent, re-
spectively, each 0.2 percentage point lower than in the 
September projections.  The median estimate of the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.1 per-
cent, 0.1 percentage point lower than in September.   

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate, respectively, from 2019 to 2022 and in 
the longer run.  The distribution of individual projec-
tions for real GDP growth for 2020 tilted slightly higher, 
as many participants upgraded their projections a bit rel-
ative to those in the September SEP, although the me-
dian projection was unchanged.  The distributions of in-
dividual projections of real GDP growth in 2021 and 
2022 and in the longer run were little changed overall.  
The distributions of individual projections for the unem-
ployment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run 
shifted lower relative to those in September.   

The Outlook for Inflation 
As shown in table 1, the median projection for core PCE 
price inflation was 1.6 percent for 2019, a modest de-
crease from the September projections.  The medians of 
the projections for both total and core PCE price infla-
tion were each 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent in 
both 2021 and 2022—all unchanged from September.  
Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of partici-
pants’ views about their outlooks for inflation.  Al-
though the medians of the projections for total and core 
PCE price inflation from 2020 through 2022 were un-
changed from the September SEP, a couple more par-
ticipants projected inflation to be slightly above the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2022.   

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E shows the distributions of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of 

each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run.  A 
substantial majority of participants projected a federal 
funds rate of 1.63 percent for the end of 2020.  Four 
participants assessed that the most likely appropriate rate 
at year-end for 2020 would be 1.88 percent.  For subse-
quent years, the medians of the projections were 
1.88 percent at the end of 2021 and 2.13 percent at the 
end of 2022.  The distribution of participants’ estimates 
of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was little 
changed, and the median estimate was unchanged from 
September at 2.50 percent.   

Compared with the projections prepared for the Sep-
tember SEP, a number of participants marked down 
their assessments of the appropriate level of the federal 
funds rate at the end of 2020, reflecting in part the re-
duction in the target range at the October meeting and 
causing both the range and central tendency of projec-
tions for 2020 to narrow considerably.  Some partici-
pants lowered their projections for the appropriate level 
in 2021 and 2022.  The median projection for the federal 
funds rate was 25 basis points lower in each year in the 
projection period.  Realized inflation running persis-
tently below target and risks associated with trade policy 
and foreign economic growth were cited as key factors 
informing participants’ judgments about the appropriate 
path for the federal funds rate. 

Uncertainty and Risks  
In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of 
possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those 
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government forecasts over the past 
20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and total PCE price inflation.  Those measures are 
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the 
top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts 
display the SEP medians for the three variables sur-
rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived 
from the forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the de-
gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar 
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the 
risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then 
future outcomes of these variables would have about a 
70 percent probability of being within these confidence 
intervals.  For all three variables, this measure of uncer-

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  A substantial majority of participants viewed the 
uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic var-
iables as being broadly similar to the average over the 
past 20 years. 

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their current economic 
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Relative to the September SEP, 
more participants saw the risks to the outlook for real 
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly bal-
anced,  although a small majority continued  to view the 

risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted 
to the downside and for the unemployment rate as 
weighted to the upside.  Most participants continued to 
judge the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly bal-
anced, while some participants viewed the risks to their 
inflation outlook as weighted to the downside.  No par-
ticipant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook 
as weighted to the upside.   

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, some participants mentioned 
trade developments and concerns about foreign eco-
nomic growth as sources of uncertainty or downside risk 
to the U.S. economic growth outlook.  In contrast, the 
underlying strength of both consumer spending and the 
labor market was cited as balancing the risks around the 
growth outlook.  In addition, most of the participants 
who shifted their balance of risks for output growth to 
“broadly balanced” cited more accommodative mone-
tary policy as a contributing factor.  For the inflation out-
look, the possibility that inflation expectations could be 
drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 per-
cent inflation objective was viewed as a downside risk.  
A couple of participants mentioned higher tariffs as a 
source of upside risk to their inflation outlook.   

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal 
funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-
opments over time in key economic variables—such as 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion—uncertainty surrounding the projected path for 
the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertain-
ties about the paths for these economic variables, along 
with other factors.  Figure 5 provides a graphic represen-
tation of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for 
the federal funds rate surrounded by symmetric confi-
dence intervals derived from the results presented in ta-
ble 2.  As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast 
uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the fed-
eral funds rate is substantial and increases for longer ho-
rizons.

were released in the winter by various private and government fore-
casters.  As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain 
assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual out-
comes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal 
funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection 
errors made in the past.  For more information, see David Reifschnei-
der and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic 
Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors:  The Federal Reserve’s 
Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to 
fourth quarter basis. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury 
bills.  Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, 
in the fourth quarter.

and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years;
more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the

risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20
years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For
definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

Federal funds rate

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of
the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to onset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.4 to 
4.6 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the 
third and fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent con-
fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 per-
cent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, 
1.0 to 3.0 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 2.9 percent in 
the fourth year.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these con-
fidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen-
tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  How-
ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may 
not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate can-
not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular 
projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down-
side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be 
asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
