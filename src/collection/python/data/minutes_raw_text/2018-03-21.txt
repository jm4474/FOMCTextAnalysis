Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac-
count (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in 
domestic and global financial markets over the inter-
meeting period; she also reported on open market oper-
ations and related issues.  Financial markets experienced 
a notable bout of volatility early in the intermeeting pe-
riod; volatility was particularly pronounced in equity 
markets.  Market participants pointed to incoming eco-
nomic data released in early February—particularly data 
on average hourly earnings—as raising concerns about 

the prospects for higher inflation and higher interest 
rates.  These concerns reportedly contributed to a steep 
decline in equity prices and an associated rise in 
measures of volatility.  Some reports suggested that the 
increase in volatility was amplified by the unwinding of 
trading positions based on various types of volatility 
trading strategies.  Measures of equity market volatility 
declined over subsequent weeks but remained above lev-
els that prevailed earlier in the year, and stock prices fin-
ished lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Inter-
est rates rose modestly over the period.  Respondents to 
the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and 
market participants suggested that revisions in investors’ 
views regarding the fiscal outlook were an important fac-
tor boosting yields and contributing to a slightly steeper 
expected trajectory of the federal funds rate.  The deputy 
manager noted that a rapid and sizable increase in Treas-
ury bill issuance over recent weeks had put upward pres-
sure on money market yields over the period.  Three-
month Treasury bill yields moved up significantly and 
those increases passed through to rates on other short-
term instruments such as three-month Eurodollar de-
posits and commercial paper.  The spread of market 
rates on overnight repurchase agreements over the of-
fering rate at the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse re-
purchase (ON RRP) facility widened, and take-up at the 
facility fell to quite low levels as a result.  Rates on over-
night federal funds and Eurodollar transactions edged 
higher relative to the interest rate on excess reserves.  
The Desk continued to execute the FOMC’s balance 
sheet normalization plan initiated in October of last year. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the 
intermeeting period.  There were no intervention 
operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account 
during the intermeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the March 20–21 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions continued to 
strengthen through February and suggested that real 
gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a moderate 
pace in the first quarter.  Consumer price inflation, as 
measured by the 12-month percentage change in the 
price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE), remained below 2 percent in January.   
Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-
tions were little changed on balance. 

Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment were strong 
over the two months ending in February.  The labor 
force participation rate held steady in January and then 
stepped up markedly in February, with the participation

rates for prime-age (defined as ages 25 to 54) women and 
men moving up on net.  The national unemployment 
rate remained at 4.1 percent.  Similarly, the unemploy-
ment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics 
were roughly flat, on balance, in recent months.  The 
share of workers employed part time for economic rea-
sons edged up but remained close to its pre-recession 
levels.  The rates of private-sector job openings and quits 
increased slightly, on net, over the two months ending 
in January, and the four-week moving average of initial 
claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued 
to be low in early March.  Recent readings showed that 
increases in labor compensation remained modest.  
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
advanced 2¾ percent over the four quarters of last year, 
and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 
2½ percent over the 12 months ending in February. 

Total industrial production expanded, on net, in January 
and February, with gains in both manufacturing and 
mining.  Automakers’ schedules indicated that assem-
blies of light motor vehicles would likely edge down in 
coming months.  However, broader indicators of manu-
facturing production, such as the new orders indexes 
from national and regional manufacturing surveys, 
pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the 
near term. 

Consumer expenditures appeared likely to rise at a mod-
est pace in the first quarter following a strong gain in the 
preceding quarter.  Real PCE edged down in January, 
and the components of the nominal retail sales data used 
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its es-
timate of PCE rose somewhat in February while the pace 
of light motor vehicle sales declined slightly.  However, 
household spending was probably held back somewhat 
in February because of a delay in many federal tax re-
funds, and the subsequent delivery of those refunds 
would likely contribute to an increase in consumer 
spending in March.  Moreover, the lower tax withhold-
ing resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year, 
which was beginning to show through in consumers’ 
paychecks, would likely provide some impetus to spend-
ing in coming months.  More broadly, recent readings 
on key factors that influence consumer spending—in-
cluding gains in employment and real disposable per-
sonal income, along with households’ elevated net 
worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE 
growth in the near term.  In addition, consumer senti-
ment in early March, as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was at its highest level 
since 2004.  

Real residential investment looked to be slowing in the 
first quarter after rising briskly in the fourth quarter.  
Starts of new single-family homes increased in January 
and February, although building permit issuance moved 
down somewhat.  Starts of multifamily units jumped in 
January but fell back in February.  Sales of both new and 
existing homes declined in January. 

Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property appeared to be moderat-
ing in the first quarter after increasing at a solid pace in 
the preceding quarter.  Nominal shipments of nonde-
fense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in Jan-
uary.  However, recent forward-looking indicators of 
business equipment spending—such as the backlog of 
unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings 
on business sentiment from national and regional sur-
veys—pointed to further solid gains in equipment 
spending in the near term.  Firms’ nominal spending for 
nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min-
ing sector declined in January.  In contrast, the number 
of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indica-
tor of business spending for structures in the drilling and 
mining sector—continued to move up through mid-
March. 

Total real government purchases seemed to be flattening 
out, on balance, in the first quarter after rising solidly in 
the fourth quarter.  Nominal defense spending in Janu-
ary and February was consistent with a decline in real 
federal purchases.  In contrast, real purchases by state 
and local governments looked to be rising, as the pay-
rolls of these governments increased in January and Feb-
ruary and nominal state and local construction spending 
advanced somewhat in January.  

The change in net exports was a significant drag on real 
GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, as imports 
grew rapidly.  The nominal U.S. international trade defi-
cit widened in January; exports declined, led by lower ex-
ports of capital goods and industrial supplies, while im-
ports were about flat.  The slowing of real import growth 
following the rapid increase in the fourth quarter sug-
gested that the drag on real GDP growth from net ex-
ports would lessen in the first quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1¾ percent over the 12 months 
ending in January.  Core PCE price inflation, which ex-
cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 
1½ percent over that same period.  The consumer price 
index (CPI) rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending 
in February, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent.  
Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run

inflation expectations—including those from the Michi-
gan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and 
the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of 
Market Participants—were little changed on balance. 

Foreign economic activity expanded at a moderate pace 
in the fourth quarter.  Real GDP growth picked up in 
Mexico but slowed a bit in some advanced foreign econ-
omies (AFEs) and in emerging Asia.  Recent indicators 
pointed to solid economic growth abroad in the first 
quarter of this year.  Inflation abroad continued to be 
boosted by the pass-through to consumer prices of past 
increases in oil prices.  However, excluding food and en-
ergy prices, inflation remained subdued in many foreign 
economies, including the euro area and Japan. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Financial markets were turbulent over the intermeeting 
period, and market volatility increased notably.  On net, 
U.S. equity prices declined, corporate bond spreads wid-
ened, and nominal Treasury yields rose. 

Broad equity price indexes decreased over the intermeet-
ing period.  Market participants pointed to a larger-than-
expected increase in average hourly earnings in the Jan-
uary employment report as a factor triggering increased 
investor concerns about inflation and the associated 
pace of interest rate increases.  Those concerns appeared 
to induce a substantial decline in equity prices.  The de-
cline may have been exacerbated by broader concerns 
about the level of stock market valuations.  On Febru-
ary 5, the VIX—an index of option-implied volatility for 
one-month returns on the S&P 500 index—rose to its 
highest level since 2015, reportedly driven in part by the 
unwinding of investment strategies designed to profit 
from low volatility.  Subsequently, equity prices recov-
ered about half of their decline, and the VIX partially 
retraced its earlier increase. 

Monetary policy communications over the intermeeting 
period—including the January FOMC statement, the 
minutes of the January FOMC meeting, and the Chair-
man’s semiannual testimony to the Congress—were 
generally viewed by market participants as signaling a 
somewhat stronger economic outlook and thus rein-
forced expectations for further gradual increases in the 
target range for the federal funds rate.  The probability 
of the next rate hike occurring at the March FOMC 
meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures 
contracts, increased to near certainty.  Conditional on a 
March rate hike, the market-implied probability of an-
other increase in the federal funds rate target range at the 
June FOMC meeting edged up to just above 70 percent.  
Expectations for the federal funds rate at the end of 

2019 and 2020, derived from overnight index swap 
(OIS) quotes, moved up somewhat since late January. 

On net, the nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up and 
flattened a bit.  Monetary policy communications, 
higher-than-expected domestic price data, and expecta-
tions for increases in the supply of Treasury securities 
following the federal budget agreement in early February 
contributed to the increase in Treasury yields.  Measures 
of inflation compensation derived from Treasury  
Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed on net.  
Option-implied volatility on longer-term rates rose no-
tably following the jump in equity market volatility on 
February 5 but mostly retraced that increase by the end 
of the intermeeting period.  On balance, spreads on  
investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields 
over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened but 
remained near the lower end of their historical ranges. 

In short-term funding markets, increased issuance of 
Treasury bills lifted Treasury bill yields above  
comparable-maturity OIS rates for the first time in al-
most a decade.  The rise in bill yields was a factor that 
pushed up money market rates and widened the spreads 
of certificates of deposit and term London interbank of-
fered rates relative to OIS rates.  The upward pressure 
on money market rates also showed up in slight increases 
in the effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank 
funding rate relative to the interest rate on excess re-
serves.  The rise in market rates on overnight repurchase 
agreements relative to the offering rate on the Federal 
Reserve’s ON RRP facility resulted in low levels of take-
up at the facility.  Reductions in the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet continued as scheduled without 
a notable effect on markets.   

Despite the recent volatility in some financial markets, 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations and 
households remained accommodative over the inter-
meeting period and continued to support further expan-
sion of economic activity.  Gross issuance of invest-
ment- and speculative-grade bonds was slightly lower 
than usual in January and February, while gross issuance 
of institutional leveraged loans stayed strong.  The pro-
vision of bank-intermediated credit to businesses slowed 
further, likely reflecting weak loan demand rather than 
tight supply.  Small business owners continued to report 
accommodative credit supply conditions but also weak 
demand for credit.  Credit conditions in municipal bond 
markets remained accommodative. 

In commercial real estate markets, loan growth at banks 
slowed further in January and February.  Financing con-
ditions in commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) markets remained accommodative, as issuance

was robust (relative to the usual seasonal slowdown) and 
CMBS spreads continued to be at low levels.  Financing 
conditions in the residential mortgage market remained 
accommodative for most borrowers, though credit con-
ditions stayed tight for borrowers with low credit scores 
or with hard-to-document incomes.  Mortgage rates 
moved up, on net, over the period, along with the rise in 
other long-term rates.  

Consumer credit grew at a solid pace in January follow-
ing a rapid expansion in the fourth quarter.  Aggregate 
credit card balances continued to expand steadily in Jan-
uary.  Nonetheless, for subprime borrowers, conditions 
remained tight, with credit limits and balances still low 
by historical standards.  Auto lending continued to grow 
at a moderate pace in recent months; although under-
writing standards in the subprime segment continued to 
tighten, there were few signs of a significant restriction 
in credit supply for auto loans. 

Since the January FOMC meeting, foreign equity prices 
moved notably lower, on net, and generally declined 
more in the AFEs than in the United States.  Longer-
term yields on sovereign debt in AFEs either decreased 
moderately or ended the period little changed, in con-
trast to the increase in U.S. Treasury yields.  Weaker-
than-expected economic data weighed on market-based 
measures of expected policy rate paths and on longer-
term yields in Canada and in the euro area.  Communi-
cations from the Bank of Canada also seemed to con-
tribute to the decline in Canadian yields.  In the United 
Kingdom, longer-term yields were little changed, on net, 
although the market-based path of expected policy rates 
moved up moderately in response to Bank of England 
communications.  In emerging market economies 
(EMEs), sovereign yield spreads widened modestly, and 
flows into EME mutual funds were volatile over the pe-
riod.  

The broad nominal dollar index appreciated moderately 
over the period, largely reflecting an outsized deprecia-
tion of the Canadian dollar and a massive devaluation of 
the Venezuelan bolivar.  (The Venezuelan government 
devalued the official Venezuelan exchange rate by more 
than 99 percent against the dollar, bringing the official 
rate closer to its black market value.)  Lower oil prices, 
weaker-than-expected economic data, and uncertainty 
over U.S. trade policy likely contributed to the weakness 
in the Canadian dollar.  In contrast, the Japanese yen ap-
preciated against the dollar, in part supported by safe-
haven demand.  Late in the intermeeting period, the Brit-
ish pound was boosted by news of a preliminary agree-
ment between U.K. and European Union authorities re-
garding the transition period of the Brexit process, but 

the pound still ended the intermeeting period modestly 
weaker against the dollar. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The staff projection for U.S. economic activity prepared 
for the March FOMC meeting was somewhat stronger, 
on balance, than the forecast at the time of the January 
meeting.  The near-term forecast for real GDP growth 
was revised down a little; the incoming spending data 
were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the 
staff judged that the softness was not associated with re-
sidual seasonality in the data.  However, the slowing in 
the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to 
be transitory, and the medium-term projection for GDP 
growth was revised up modestly, largely reflecting the 
expected boost to GDP from the federal budget agree-
ment enacted in February.  Real GDP was projected to 
increase at a faster pace than potential output through 
2020.  The unemployment rate was projected to decline 
further over the next few years and to continue to run 
below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate 
over this period.  

The projection for inflation over the medium term was 
revised up a bit, reflecting the slightly tighter resource 
utilization in the new forecast.  The rates of both total 
and core PCE price inflation were projected to be faster 
in 2018 than in 2017.  The staff projected that inflation 
would reach the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 
2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as balanced.  On the upside, 
recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex-
pansion in economic activity over the next few years 
than the staff projected.  On the downside, those fiscal 
policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy 
than the staff expected if the economy was already op-
erating above its potential level and resource utilization 
continued to tighten, as the staff projected.  Risks to the 
inflation projection also were seen as balanced.  An up-
side risk was that inflation could increase more than ex-
pected in an economy that was projected to move fur-
ther above its potential.  Downside risks included the 
possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may 
have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation 
readings last year could prove to be more persistent than 
the staff expected.

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these 
minutes. 

In their discussion of economic conditions and the out-
look, meeting participants agreed that information re-
ceived since the FOMC met in January indicated that 
economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate and 
that the labor market had continued to strengthen.  Job 
gains had been strong in recent months, and the unem-
ployment rate had stayed low.  On a 12-month basis, 
both overall inflation and inflation for items other than 
food and energy continued to run below 2 percent.   
Market-based measures of inflation compensation had 
increased in recent months but remained low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
were little changed, on balance. 

Participants noted incoming data suggesting some slow-
ing in the rate of growth of household spending and 
business fixed investment after strong fourth-quarter 
readings.  However, they expected that the first-quarter 
softness would be transitory, pointing to a variety of fac-
tors, including delayed payment of some personal tax re-
funds, residual seasonality in the data, and more gener-
ally to strong economic fundamentals.  Among the fun-
damentals that participants cited were high levels of con-
sumer and business sentiment, supportive financial con-
ditions, improved economic conditions abroad, and re-
cent changes in fiscal policy.  Participants generally saw 
the news on spending and the labor market over the past 
few quarters as being consistent with continued above-
trend growth and a further strengthening in labor mar-
kets.  Participants expected that, with further gradual in-
creases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would 
expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year 
and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor 
market conditions would remain strong.  Inflation on a 
12-month basis was expected to move up in coming 

months and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term.  Several partici-
pants noted that the 12-month PCE price inflation rate 
would likely shift upward when the March data are re-
leased because the effects of the outsized decline in the 
prices of cell phone service plans in March of last year 
will drop out of that calculation.  Near-term risks to the 
economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but 
participants agreed that it would be important to con-
tinue to monitor inflation developments closely. 

Many participants reported considerable optimism 
among the business contacts in their Districts, consistent 
with a firming in business expenditures.  Respondents to 
District surveys in both the manufacturing and service 
sectors were generally upbeat about the economic out-
look.  In some Districts, reports from business contacts 
or evidence from surveys pointed to continuing short-
ages of workers in segments of the labor market.  Activ-
ity in the energy sector continued to expand, with con-
tacts suggesting that further increases were likely, pro-
vided that sufficient labor resources were forthcoming.  
In contrast, contacts in the agricultural sector reported 
that farm income continued to experience downward 
pressure due to low crop prices. 

A number of participants reported concern among their 
business contacts about the possible ramifications of the 
recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and alumi-
num.  Participants did not see the steel and aluminum 
tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect 
on the national economic outlook, but a strong majority 
of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade 
actions by other countries, as well as other issues and 
uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside 
risks for the U.S. economy.  Contacts in the agricultural 
sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retalia-
tion. 

Tax changes enacted late last year and the recent federal 
budget agreement, taken together, were expected to pro-
vide a significant boost to output over the next few 
years.  However, participants generally regarded the 
magnitude and timing of the economic effects of the fis-
cal policy changes as uncertain, partly because there have 
been few historical examples of expansionary fiscal pol-
icy being implemented when the economy was operating 
at a high level of resource utilization.  A number of par-
ticipants also suggested that uncertainty about whether 
all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, 
or about the implications of higher budget deficits for 
fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented 
sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.  A

few participants noted that the changes in tax policy 
could boost the level of potential output. 

Most participants described labor market conditions as 
strong, noting that payroll gains had remained well 
above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing 
new labor force entrants over time, the unemployment 
rate had stayed low, job openings had been high, or that 
initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had 
been low.  Many participants observed that the labor 
force participation rate had been higher recently than 
they had expected, helping to keep the unemployment 
rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll 
gains.  The firmness in the overall participation rate—
relative to its demographically driven downward trend—
and the rising participation rate of prime-age adults were 
regarded as signs of continued strengthening in labor 
market conditions. A few participants thought that these 
favorable developments could continue for a time, 
whereas others expressed doubts.  A few participants 
warned against inferring too much from comparisons of 
the current low level of the unemployment rate with his-
torical benchmarks, arguing that the much higher levels 
of education of today’s workforce—and the lower aver-
age unemployment rate of more highly educated work-
ers than less educated workers—suggested that the U.S. 
economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment 
rates than was the case in the 1950s or 1960s. 

In some Districts, reports from business contacts or ev-
idence from surveys pointed to a pickup in wages, par-
ticularly for unskilled or entry-level workers.  However, 
business contacts or national surveys led a few partici-
pants to conclude that some businesses facing labor 
shortages were changing job requirements so that they 
matched more closely the skills of available workers, in-
creasing training, or offering more flexible work arrange-
ments, rather than increasing wages in a broad-based 
fashion.  Regarding wage growth at the national level, 
several participants noted a modest increase, but most 
still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few 
participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was 
room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat fur-
ther. 

In some Districts, surveys or business contacts reported 
increases in nonwage costs, particularly in the cost of 
materials, and in a few Districts, contacts reported pass-
ing on some of those costs in the form of higher prices.  
Contacts in a few Districts suggested that widely known, 
observable cost increases—such as those associated with 
rising commodity prices—would be more likely to be ac-
cepted and passed through to final goods prices than 
would less observable costs such as wage increases.  A 

few participants argued that either an absence of pricing 
power among at least some firms—perhaps stemming 
from globalization and technological innovations, in-
cluding ones that facilitate price comparisons—or the 
ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production 
has been damping inflationary pressures.  Many partici-
pants stated that recent readings from indicators on in-
flation and inflation expectations increased their confi-
dence that inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective in coming months and then stabilize 
around that level; others suggested that downside risks 
to inflation were subsiding.  In contrast, a few partici-
pants cautioned that, despite increases in market-based 
measures of inflation compensation in recent months 
and the stabilization of some survey measures of infla-
tion expectations, the levels of these indicators remained 
too low to be consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective. 

In their discussion of developments in financial markets, 
some participants observed that financial conditions re-
mained accommodative despite the rise in market vola-
tility and repricing of assets that had occurred in Febru-
ary.  Many participants reported that their contacts had 
taken the previous month’s turbulence in stride, al-
though a few participants suggested that financial devel-
opments over the intermeeting period highlighted some 
downside risks associated with still-high valuations for 
equities or from market volatility more generally.  A few 
participants expressed concern that a lengthy period in 
which the economy operates beyond potential and fi-
nancial conditions remain highly accommodative could, 
over time, pose risks to financial stability. 

In their consideration of monetary policy, participants 
discussed the implications of recent economic and finan-
cial developments for the appropriate path of the federal 
funds rate.  All participants agreed that the outlook for 
the economy beyond the current quarter had strength-
ened in recent months.  In addition, all participants ex-
pected inflation on a 12-month basis to move up in com-
ing months.  This expectation partly reflected the arith-
metic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early 
2017 dropping out of the calculation; it was noted that 
the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source 
was widely expected and, by itself, would not justify a 
change in the projected path for the federal funds rate.  
Most participants commented that the stronger eco-
nomic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation read-
ings in recent months had increased the likelihood of 
progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation ob-
jective.  A few participants suggested that a modest in-

flation overshoot might help push up longer-term infla-
tion expectations and anchor them at a level consistent 
with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  A 
number of participants offered their views on the poten-
tial benefits and costs associated with an economy oper-
ating well above potential for a prolonged period while 
inflation remained low.  On the one hand, the associated 
tightness in the labor market might help speed the return 
of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent goal and in-
duce a further increase in labor force participation; on 
the other hand, an overheated economy could result in 
significant inflation pressures or lead to financial insta-
bility.   

Based on their current assessments, almost all partici-
pants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for 
the Committee to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  These partic-
ipants agreed that, even after such an increase in the tar-
get range, the stance of monetary policy would remain 
accommodative, supporting strong labor market condi-
tions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.  A 
couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of 
postponing an increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate until a subsequent meeting; these participants 
suggested that waiting for additional data to provide 
more evidence of a sustained return of the 12-month in-
flation rate to 2 percent might more clearly demonstrate 
the data dependence of the Committee’s decisions and 
its resolve to achieve the price-stability component of its 
dual mandate. 

With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary 
policy, all participants saw some further firming of the 
stance of monetary policy as likely to be warranted.  Al-
most all participants agreed that it remained appropriate 
to follow a gradual approach to raising the target range 
for the federal funds rate.  Several participants com-
mented that this gradual approach was most likely to be 
conducive to maintaining strong labor market condi-
tions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained 
basis without resulting in conditions that would eventu-
ally require an abrupt policy tightening.  A number of 
participants indicated that the stronger outlook for eco-
nomic activity, along with their increased confidence 
that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium 
term, implied that the appropriate path for the federal 
funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly 
steeper than they had previously expected.  Participants 
agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was 
likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular 
forces that had put downward pressure on real interest 
rates.  Several participants expressed the judgment that 

it would likely become appropriate at some point for the 
Committee to set the federal funds rate above its longer-
run normal value for a time.  Some participants sug-
gested that, at some point, it might become necessary to 
revise statement language to acknowledge that, in pur-
suit of the Committee’s statutory mandate and con-
sistent with the median of participants’ policy rate pro-
jections in the SEP, monetary policy eventually would 
likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to 
being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activ-
ity.  However, participants expressed a range of views on 
the amount of policy tightening that would likely be re-
quired over the medium term to achieve the Commit-
tee’s goals.  Participants agreed that the actual path of 
the federal funds rate would depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in January indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and that economic 
activity had been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains had 
been strong in recent months, and the unemployment 
rate had stayed low.  Recent data suggested that growth 
rates of household spending and business fixed invest-
ment had moderated from their strong fourth-quarter 
readings.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation 
and inflation for items other than food and energy had 
continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had increased in re-
cent months but remained low; survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, 
on balance. 

All members viewed the recent data and other develop-
ments bearing on real economic activity as suggesting 
that the outlook for the economy beyond the current 
quarter had strengthened in recent months.  In addition, 
notwithstanding increased market volatility over the in-
termeeting period, financial conditions had stayed ac-
commodative, and developments since the January 
meeting had indicated that fiscal policy was likely to pro-
vide greater impetus to the economy over the next few 
years than members had previously thought.  Conse-
quently, members expected that, with further gradual ad-
justments in the stance of monetary policy, economic ac-
tivity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium 
term, and labor market conditions would remain strong.    
Members generally continued to judge the risks to the 
economic outlook as remaining roughly balanced. 

Most members noted that recent readings on inflation, 
along with the strengthening of the economic outlook,

provided support for the view that inflation on a  
12-month basis would likely move up in coming months 
and stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term.  Members agreed to continue to 
monitor inflation developments closely. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent.  They indicated that the stance 
of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus-
tained return to 2 percent inflation. 

Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
would depend on their assessments of realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  They reiterated that this assessment would take 
into account a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla-
tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings 
on financial and international developments.  Members 
also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and 
expected developments in inflation in relation to the 
Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.  Members ex-
pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man-
ner that would warrant further gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate.  They judged that raising the target 
range gradually would balance the risks to the outlook 
for inflation and unemployment and was most likely to 
support continued economic expansion.  Members 
agreed that the strengthening in the economic outlook 
in recent months increased the likelihood that a gradual 
upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap-
propriate.  Members continued to anticipate that the fed-
eral funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below 
levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run.  
Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for 
the federal funds rate would depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective March 22, 2018, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 

of 1½ to 1¾ percent, including overnight re-
verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-
chase operations with maturities of more than 
one day when necessary to accommodate week-
end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at 
an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts lim-
ited only by the value of Treasury securities held 
outright in the System Open Market Account 
that are available for such operations and by a 
per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during March 
that exceeds $12 billion, and to continue rein-
vesting in agency mortgage-backed securities 
the amount of principal payments from the 
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities received 
during March that exceeds $8 billion.  Effective 
in April, the Committee directs the Desk to roll 
over at auction the amount of principal pay-
ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
Treasury securities maturing during each calen-
dar month that exceeds $18 billion, and to rein-
vest in agency mortgage-backed securities the 
amount of principal payments from the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities received during 
each calendar month that exceeds $12 billion.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in January indicates that 
the labor market has continued to strengthen 
and that economic activity has been rising at a 
moderate rate.  Job gains have been strong in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate has 
stayed low.  Recent data suggest that growth 
rates of household spending and business fixed 
investment have moderated from their strong 
fourth-quarter readings.  On a 12-month basis, 
both overall inflation and inflation for items 
other than food and energy have continued to

run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation have increased in recent 
months but remain low; survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The economic outlook has 
strengthened in recent months.  The Committee 
expects that, with further gradual adjustments in 
the stance of monetary policy, economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace in the medium 
term and labor market conditions will remain 
strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is ex-
pected to move up in coming months and to 
stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective over the medium term.  Near-term risks 
to the economic outlook appear roughly bal-
anced, but the Committee is monitoring infla-
tion developments closely. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting strong labor market condi-
tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla-
tion. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 

monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
further gradual increases in the federal funds 
rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for 
some time, below levels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual 
path of the federal funds rate will depend on the 
economic outlook as informed by incoming 
data.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, William C. 
Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael 
Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Randal K. Quarles, and John 
C. Williams. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to 
1¾ percent, effective March 22, 2018.  The Board of 
Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ per-
centage point increase in the primary credit rate (dis-
count rate) to 2¼ percent, effective March 22, 2018.4 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, May 1–2, 2018.  
The meeting adjourned at 9:55 a.m. on March 21, 2018. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on February 20, 2018, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on January 30–31, 2018.

4 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted 
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, At-
lanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  This 
vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors 
of the establishment of a 2¼ percent primary credit rate by 
the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of 
March 22, 2018, and the date such Reserve Banks informed 

the Secretary of the Board of such a request.  (Secretary’s note:  
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Min-
neapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the 
Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit 
rate of 2¼ percent, effective March 22, 2018.)  The second 
vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establish-
ment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit 
under the existing formulas for computing such rates.

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 20–21, 2018, meet-
ing participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each 
year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each 
participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-
isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability. 

All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that real GDP in 2018 would expand at a pace 
exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run 
growth rate of real GDP.  Participants generally saw real 
GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol-
lowing two years, with almost all participants who sub-
mitted longer-run projections anticipating that real GDP 
growth in 2020 would be at or within a few tenths of a 
percentage point of their longer-run estimates.  All par-
ticipants who submitted longer-run projections expected 
that, throughout the projection period, the unemploy-
ment rate would run below their estimates of its longer-
run level.  All participants projected that inflation, as 
measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the 
price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE), would rise to or toward the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective this year and would be at or a little above 
that objective by 2020.  Compared with the Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP) from December, a sub-
stantial majority of participants marked up their projec-
tions for real GDP growth and lowered their projections 
for the unemployment rate; participants indicated that 
these revisions reflected a number of factors, such as 

                                                 
1 Three members of the Board of Governors were in office at 
the time of the March 2018 meeting, one member fewer than 
in December 2017. 

changes in fiscal policy, a stronger outlook for economic 
growth abroad, or recent strong job gains.  For inflation, 
a majority of participants made slight upward revisions 
to their projections; these revisions were attributed to re-
cent price data and the effects of a stronger economic 
outlook than in the December SEP.  Table 1 and fig-
ure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to 
expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in 
the federal funds rate.  Although the median of partici-
pants’ projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 
2018 was unchanged relative to the December SEP, a 
number of participants marked up their projections for 
this year.  Moreover, a substantial majority of partici-
pants revised up their federal funds rate projections for 
2019 and 2020.  The median of participants’ projections 
for the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was 
slightly higher relative to the December SEP.  Nearly all 
participants who submitted longer-run projections ex-
pected that evolving economic conditions would make 
it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move above 
their estimates of its longer-run level during part of the 
projection period. 

In general, participants continued to view the uncer-
tainty attached to their economic projections as broadly 
similar to the average of the past 20 years.  As in Decem-
ber, most participants judged the risks around their pro-
jections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation to be broadly balanced. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess-
ments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.7 percent 
for this year and 2.4 percent for next year.  The median 
projection for real GDP growth in 2020 was 2.0 percent, 
a touch above the 1.8 percent median of participants’ 
longer-run estimates.  Most participants cited federal fis-
cal policy developments—specifically, the enactment of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act 
of 2018—as boosting their projections for economic ac-
tivity over the next couple of years.  Several participants 
mentioned other factors that influenced their economic 

2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate.

projections, including accommodative monetary policy 
and financial conditions, strength in the global economic 
outlook, and continued momentum in the labor market.  
Compared with the December SEP, the medians of par-
ticipants’ projections for real GDP growth this year and 
next year were up a few tenths of a percentage point. 

Consistent with their projections for economic activity, 
almost all participants expected labor market conditions 
to strengthen further over the projection period.  The 
medians of projections for the unemployment rate 
showed that rate stepping down from 4.1 percent in the 
final quarter of 2017 to 3.8 percent in the final quarter 
of this year, and then to 3.6 percent in the final quarters 
of 2019 and 2020.  The median of participants’ estimates 
of the longer-run unemployment rate was 4.5 percent.  
Compared with the December SEP, almost all partici-
pants marked down their unemployment rate projec-
tions.  Some participants also lowered their estimates of 
the longer-run level of the unemployment rate, leading 
to a small decline in the corresponding median projec-
tion. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run.  
The distributions of individual projections for real GDP 
growth this year and next year shifted up noticeably from 
those in the December SEP; participants’ projections 
ranged from 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2018 and from 2.0 to 
2.8 percent in 2019.  By contrast, the distributions of 
projected real GDP growth in 2020 and in the longer run 
shifted up modestly since December.  Consistent with 
participants’ generally more upbeat outlook for real 
GDP growth, the distributions of individual projections 
for the unemployment rate were lower than the corre-
sponding distributions in December for each year of the 
projection period. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
The medians of participants’ projections for both total 
and core PCE price inflation were 1.9 percent in 2018—
with all participants anticipating that each measure 
would rise from its 2017 rate—and 2.1 percent by 2020.  
Compared with the December SEP, the medians of par-
ticipants’ projections for each measure were unchanged 
this year and up 0.1 percentage point in 2020. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  Participants generally made minor upward ad-
justments to their inflation projections, resulting in slight 
shifts of the distributions to the right relative to the dis-
tributions in December.  Participants generally expected 

each measure to increase to no more than 2 percent this 
year and to rise to, or edge above, 2 percent in 2019 and 
2020. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target—or mid-
point of the target range—for the federal funds rate at 
the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer 
run.  The distributions of projected policy rates through 
2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with the revi-
sions to participants’ projections of real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, and inflation.  For 2018, there 
was a notable reduction in the dispersion of participants’ 
views, with most participants now regarding the appro-
priate target at the end of the year as being between 2.13 
and 2.62 percent.  For each subsequent year, the disper-
sion of participants’ year-end projections was somewhat 
greater than that in the December SEP, and the range of 
participants’ projections was noticeably larger than for 
2018. 

The median of participants’ projections of the federal 
funds rate rises gradually to a level of 2.1 percent at the 
end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 
3.4 percent at the end of 2020.  The median of partici-
pants’ longer-run estimates, at 2.9 percent, was a bit 
higher than in the December SEP.  Nearly all partici-
pants projected that it would likely be appropriate for 
the federal funds rate to rise above their individual 
longer-run estimates at some point over the forecast pe-
riod. 

In discussing their projections, many participants con-
tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory 
of the federal funds rate over the next few years would 
likely involve gradual increases.  This view was predi-
cated on several factors, including a judgment that a 
gradual path likely would appropriately balance the risks 
associated with, among other considerations, the possi-
bility that inflation pressures and financial imbalances 
could build if economic activity were to run well above 
its long-run sustainable level and the possibility that the 
forces depressing inflation could prove to be more per-
sistent than currently anticipated.  Another factor men-
tioned was the view that the neutral real interest rate was 
historically low and would likely move up only slowly.  
As always, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate 
would depend on evolving economic conditions and 
their implications for participants’ economic outlooks 
and assessments of risks.

Uncertainty and Risks 
In assessing the path for the federal funds rate that, in 
their view, is likely to be appropriate, FOMC participants 
take account of the range of possible economic out-
comes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the poten-
tial benefits and costs should they occur.  As a reference, 
table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based 
on the forecast errors of various private and government 
forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, and total PCE inflation.  Those 
measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” 
shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The 
fan charts display the median SEP projections for the 
three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence in-
tervals derived from the forecast errors reported in ta-
ble 2.  If the degree of uncertainty attending these pro-
jections is similar to the typical magnitude of past fore-
cast errors and the risks around the projections are 
broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these varia-
bles would have about a 70 percent probability of being 
within these confidence intervals.  For all three variables, 
this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally 
increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. 

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer-
tainty attached to their economic projections about real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as 
broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, a view 
that was essentially unchanged from December.3 

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec-
tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in December, most partici-
pants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, total inflation, and core 
inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, as 
broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  Partici-
pants who saw the risks as skewed typically judged that 
the balance of risks was tilted toward stronger GDP 
growth, lower unemployment rates, and higher inflation.  
Compared with the December SEP, participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks attending their projections

discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur-
rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach

described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His-
torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance 
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of

2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth

rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the

were little changed overall, with one more participant re-
porting that the risks to the unemployment rate were 
weighted to the downside and two fewer participants re-
porting that the risks to either total or core PCE inflation 
were weighted to the downside. 

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
projections, most participants noted that the magnitude 
and timing of the economic effects of recent changes in 
fiscal policy were uncertain or that fiscal policy develop-
ments posed upside risks to real economic activity.  Most 
participants also cited trade policy as a source of either 
uncertainty or downside risk.  A few participants noted 
that a prolonged period of tight labor markets posed 
risks of higher inflation, could fuel financial imbalances, 
and might contribute to heightened recession risks. 

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal 
funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-
opments over time in real GDP growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the 

used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici-
pants’ projections.

projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re-

nomic variables.  Figure 5 provides a graphical represen-
tation of this uncertainty, plotting the median SEP pro-
jection  for  the federal funds rate surrounded  by  confi-

dence intervals derived from the results presented in ta-

uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the fed-
eral funds rate is substantial and increases for longer ho-
rizons.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year and 
1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second and third years.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the 
third year.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confi-
dence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen-
tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  How-
ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may 
not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate can-
not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular 
projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down-
side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be 
asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
