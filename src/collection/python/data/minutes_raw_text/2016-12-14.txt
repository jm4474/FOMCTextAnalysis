Rules Regarding Availability of Information 
The Committee unanimously voted to amend its Rules 
Regarding Availability of Information (Rules) in order to 
comply with the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and 
to make a number of other technical changes.5  The 

                                                 
4 Attended Tuesday session only. 

amended Rules would be published in the Federal Register 
as an interim final rule, which would become effective 
immediately on publication.  The Committee anticipated 
finalization of the Rules after any appropriate changes 
were incorporated based on comments received from 
the public during the 60-day comment period following 
the Federal Register notice. 

Secretary’s note:  The amended Rules were 
published in the Federal Register on December 
27, 2016. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in U.S. and global 
financial markets during the period since the Committee 
met on November 1–2, 2016.  Nominal yields on longer-
term U.S. Treasury securities rose substantially over the 
period, reflecting both higher real yields and an increase 
in inflation compensation.  The value of the dollar on 
foreign exchange markets rose, U.S. equity indexes in-
creased considerably, and credit spreads on U.S. corpo-
rate bonds narrowed.  Market pricing and survey results 
indicated that market participants had come to see a high 
probability of an increase of 25 basis points in the 
FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate at this 
meeting, and that the path of the federal funds rate an-
ticipated by market participants for coming years had 
steepened.  Surveys of market participants indicated that 
revised expectations for government spending and tax 
policy following the U.S. elections in early November 
were seen as the most important reasons, among several 
factors, for the increase in longer-term Treasury yields, 
the climb in equity valuations, and the rise in the dollar. 

The manager also reported on developments in money 
markets and open market operations.  Market interest 
rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repos) fell 
during the intermeeting period.  Market participants 
pointed to a number of factors contributing to the de-
cline, including lower demands for funding by securities 
dealers and the ample availability of financing from gov-
ernment-only money market funds (MMFs).  The de-
cline in repo rates, together with the shift of MMF assets 
toward government-only funds, had likely boosted usage 
of the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement 
(ON RRP) facility over the period.  In contrast to the 
decline in interest rates for secured money market trans-

actions, the effective federal funds rate generally re-
mained near the middle of the FOMC’s ¼ to ½ percent 
target range.  The manager also reported on the Open 
Market Desk’s regular review of operational readiness 
for a range of open market operations. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the December 13–14 
meeting indicated that real gross domestic product 
(GDP) was expanding at a moderate pace over the sec-
ond half of the year and that labor market conditions had 
continued to strengthen in recent months.  Consumer 
price inflation increased further above its pace early in 
the year but was still running below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by 
earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-en-
ergy imports. 

Taken together, a range of recent indicators showed that 
labor market conditions had tightened further.  Total 
nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in 
October and November, and the unemployment rate de-
clined, reaching 4.6 percent in November.  The share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons de-
creased; however, both the labor force participation rate 
and the employment-to-population ratio edged down on 
net.  The rates of private-sector job openings, of hiring, 
and of quits were generally little changed in September 
and October at levels above those seen during much of 
the current economic expansion.  The four-week mov-
ing average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits remained low.  Labor productivity in the busi-
ness sector was flat over the four quarters ending in the 
third quarter.  Measures of labor compensation contin-
ued to rise at a moderate rate.  Compensation per hour 
in the business sector rose 3 percent over the four quar-
ters ending in the third quarter, and average hourly earn-
ings for all employees increased 2½ percent over the 
12 months ending in November.  The unemployment 
rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for 
whites all declined in recent months.  The unemploy-
ment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics re-
mained above the rate for whites but were close to the 
levels seen just before the most recent recession. 

Total industrial production was flat in October.  Both 
manufacturing production and mining output increased, 
but the output of utilities declined markedly because of 

unseasonably warm weather in October.  Automakers’ 
assembly schedules suggested that motor vehicle pro-
duction would be roughly flat in the near term, and 
broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as 
the new orders indexes from national and regional man-
ufacturing surveys, pointed toward only modest gains in 
factory output in the coming months. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to be rising at a moderate pace in the fourth quar-
ter.  Consumer expenditures increased modestly in Oc-
tober but were restrained by a decline in spending for 
energy services that reflected unseasonably warm 
weather in that month.  Unit sales of light motor vehicles 
were higher in October and November than average 
monthly sales in the third quarter.  The components of 
the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose 
moderately in November.  Recent readings on key fac-
tors that influence consumer spending—such as contin-
ued gains in employment, real disposable personal in-
come, and households’ net worth—were consistent with 
moderate real PCE growth for the fourth quarter as a 
whole.  In addition, consumer sentiment as measured by 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers 
moved higher in November and early December. 

Recent information on housing market activity sug-
gested that real residential investment was picking up in 
the fourth quarter after decreasing in the previous two 
quarters.  Starts for both new single-family homes and 
multifamily units rose substantially in October.  Building 
permit issuance for new single-family homes—which 
tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in 
construction—also increased.  Sales of existing homes 
advanced, although new home sales dipped. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property seemed to be soft early in the fourth 
quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft edged down in October.  How-
ever, new orders of these capital goods rose and were 
running above the level of shipments, suggesting a 
pickup in business spending for equipment in the near 
term.  Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential 
structures declined in October, but the number of oil 
and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to 
edge up through early December. 

Real government purchases looked to be rising modestly 
in the fourth quarter.  Nominal federal government 
spending in October and November pointed to in-
creases in real defense purchases in the fourth quarter.

The payrolls of state and local governments expanded, 
on balance, in October and November, and nominal 
construction spending by these governments rose in Oc-
tober. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October 
after narrowing in September.  After increasing in Sep-
tember, exports fell substantially in October, reflecting 
declines in exports of agricultural products, consumer 
goods, and industrial supplies.  Imports in October re-
traced their September decline, as imports of consumer 
goods and capital goods rose.  The available trade data 
suggested that real net exports would make a negative 
contribution to real U.S. GDP growth in the fourth 
quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased almost 1½ percent over the 
12 months ending in October, partly restrained by recent 
decreases in consumer food prices and earlier declines in 
consumer energy prices.  Core PCE prices, which ex-
clude food and energy prices, rose about 1¾ percent 
over the same period, held down in part by decreases in 
the prices of non-energy imports over a portion of this 
period and by the pass-through of earlier declines in en-
ergy prices into the prices of other goods and services.  
Over the same 12-month period, total consumer prices 
as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose a 
bit more than 1½ percent, while core CPI inflation was 
around 2 percent.  The Michigan survey measure of me-
dian longer-run inflation expectations edged up, on net, 
in November and early December.  The measure of 
longer-run inflation expectations for PCE prices from 
the Survey of Professional Forecasters was unchanged 
in the fourth quarter, and measures of longer-run infla-
tion expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were also un-
changed in December. 

Foreign real GDP growth rebounded in the third quarter 
from an unusually subdued pace in the second quarter.  
This bounceback was driven primarily by stronger eco-
nomic growth in Canada and Mexico, two countries 
where the second-quarter weakness was most pro-
nounced.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), 
recent indicators were consistent with a more moderate 
pace of economic activity in the fourth quarter.  Eco-
nomic growth also appeared to slow after its uptick in 
the third quarter in the emerging market economies 
(EMEs), as indicators for Mexico suggested a return to 
a more sustainable pace of economic growth and as in-
vestment decelerated in China.  Inflation increased in 
most AFEs in recent months but remained significantly 

below central bank targets.  Inflation in the EMEs also 
moved up, driven largely by a rebound in Chinese food 
prices and, in some countries, by the effects of currency 
depreciation. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Over the intermeeting period, incoming U.S. economic 
data and Federal Reserve communications reinforced 
market participants’ expectations for an increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate at the December 
meeting.  Asset price movements as well as changes in 
the expected path for U.S. monetary policy beyond De-
cember appeared to be driven largely by expectations of 
more expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of U.S. 
elections.  Nominal Treasury yields rose across the ma-
turity spectrum, and measures of inflation compensation 
based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities contin-
ued to move up.  Meanwhile, broad equity price indexes 
increased, and credit spreads on corporate bonds nar-
rowed.  Most private borrowing rates increased some-
what, but financing conditions for nonfinancial firms 
and households remained broadly accommodative. 

Market expectations for an increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate at the December meeting rose 
over the intermeeting period.  By the end of the period, 
quotes on federal funds futures contracts, without ad-
justment for term premiums, suggested that market par-
ticipants saw a nearly 95 percent probability of a rate 
hike.  In addition, the expected federal funds rate path 
over the next few years implied by quotes on overnight 
index swap (OIS) rates steepened.  Most of the steepen-
ing of the expected policy path occurred following the 
U.S. elections, reportedly in part reflecting investors’ 
perception that the incoming Congress and Administra-
tion would enact significant fiscal stimulus measures.  
Market-based measures of uncertainty regarding mone-
tary policy at horizons beyond one year moved up, sug-
gesting that some of the firming in OIS rates could re-
flect a rise in term premiums.  Consistent with market-
based estimates, respondents to the Desk’s December 
surveys of primary dealers and market participants as-
signed a probability near 90 percent to a rate hike in De-
cember. 

Nominal Treasury yields moved up considerably since 
the November FOMC meeting.  Intermediate- and 
longer-term yields were boosted by roughly equal in-
creases in real yields and inflation compensation.  
Measures of inflation compensation extended an up-
ward trajectory that began around midyear.  Changes in 
market quotes for inflation caps and floors suggested 
that the rise in inflation compensation reflected in part 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

higher costs of protection against above-target inflation 
outcomes.  The rise in inflation compensation appeared 
to be spurred in part by the recent climb in oil prices, 
with a notable jump after OPEC’s agreement at its No-
vember 30 meeting to cut production. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose over the intermeet-
ing period, apparently boosted by investors’ expecta-
tions of stronger earnings growth and improved risk sen-
timent, with much of the rally coming after the U.S. elec-
tions.  Share prices for the financial sector outperformed 
the broader market, while stock prices in sectors that 
typically benefit from lower interest rates, such as utili-
ties, underperformed.  Implied volatility in equity mar-
kets decreased, and yield spreads of nonfinancial corpo-
rate bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities narrowed for both investment- and  
speculative-grade firms.  Available reports suggested that 
earnings for firms in the S&P 500 index increased in the 
third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, and the im-
provement in earnings was broad based across sectors. 

Money market flows continued to stabilize over the in-
termeeting period following outsized movements in the 
period before implementation of MMF reforms in mid-
October.  Assets under management at government 
MMFs rose modestly, while assets at prime MMFs were 
about unchanged.  In addition, outstanding levels of 
commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of de-
posit were stable.  The effective federal funds rate re-
mained well within the FOMC’s target range.  Rates on 
overnight Eurodollar deposits, CP, and other short-term 
unsecured instruments were close to the federal funds 
rate.  Overnight Treasury repo rates declined in mid- 
November but stayed above the ON RRP offering rate.  
Rates on term money market instruments increased, 
consistent with firming expectations for a December 
rate hike. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
generally accommodative.  Although gross issuance of 
corporate bonds slowed notably in October and No-
vember from the brisk pace in the third quarter, the de-
crease in corporate bond spreads after the U.S. elections 
suggests that the lower issuance did not reflect a tighten-
ing of financial conditions.  In addition, growth in com-
mercial and industrial loans from banks picked up after 
having dipped some during the third quarter, issuance of 
leveraged loans by nonbanks was robust, and CP out-
standing at nonfinancial firms increased on balance. 

The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained 
solid.  The volume of corporate bond rating downgrades 
in October and November outpaced that of upgrades 

but was moderate compared with rates seen in the first 
half of the year.  Default rates and expected year-ahead 
default rates for nonfinancial firms declined modestly 
over the intermeeting period, although both remained 
somewhat elevated compared with their ranges in recent 
years.  Indicators of supply and demand conditions for 
small business credit were generally unchanged over the 
past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak. 

Gross issuance of municipal bonds remained solid in 
October, and the credit quality of state and local govern-
ments was stable, as the number of ratings downgrades 
only moderately outpaced the number of upgrades in 
October and November.  Yields on general obligation 
bonds rose somewhat more than those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities over the intermeeting pe-
riod, reportedly reflecting expected reductions in the tax 
benefit of municipal bonds. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
also remained largely accommodative.  The average rate 
of growth of CRE loans at banks continued to be strong 
in October and November.  Spreads on commercial 
mortgage-backed securities narrowed a little over the in-
termeeting period, and issuance of such securities con-
tinued to outpace that of the first half of 2016. 

The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate residential mort-
gages moved up in line with Treasury yields, although 
the rate remained low by historical standards and mort-
gage availability appeared little changed.  Likely in part 
because of the increase in mortgage rates, refinance orig-
inations decreased in November, but purchase origina-
tions were little changed. 

Consumer credit continued to be readily available for 
most borrowers, and overall loan balances increased 
about 6 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem-
ber.  In the subprime sector, credit card lending stand-
ards appeared to remain tight, and extensions of new 
credit to subprime auto loan borrowers edged down in 
the third quarter.  Measures of consumer credit quality 
were little changed in the third quarter. 

Foreign financial markets responded primarily to U.S. 
developments over the intermeeting period, as market 
participants assessed the effects of potential policy 
changes resulting from the U.S. elections on foreign 
economies.  Spillovers from U.S. markets lifted yields 
and equity prices in most AFEs, but higher yields in the 
United States seemed to weigh on investor sentiment to-
ward EMEs, where prices of risky assets declined.  On a 
trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated notably 
against both AFE and EME currencies.  In particular, 

Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2016 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

the dollar strengthened about 10 percent against the Jap-
anese yen and 5 percent against the Mexican peso.  The 
declines in EME currencies and risky asset prices were 
reportedly driven by higher U.S. yields as well as by un-
certainty about possible changes in U.S. trade policies.  
Currency weakness prompted some EME central banks, 
such as the Bank of Mexico and the Central Bank of the 
Republic of Turkey, to tighten monetary policy.  How-
ever, the Central Bank of Brazil eased monetary policy 
to support economic growth. 

In the euro area, investors were attentive to the consti-
tutional referendum in Italy and the December meeting 
of the European Central Bank (ECB).  In Italy, the “No” 
vote on constitutional reform and the subsequent resig-
nation of the prime minister raised concerns that recap-
italization of the country’s banking sector would become 
more difficult.  However, these developments left little 
imprint on financial markets on net.  At its December 
meeting, the ECB extended its asset purchase program 
for a longer period of time than market participants an-
ticipated while reducing the pace of asset purchases.  In 
addition, the minimum maturity for eligible securities 
was lowered, and the limitation on purchases of securi-
ties with a yield below the deposit facility rate was re-
laxed.  As a result, sovereign yield curves in the euro area 
steepened somewhat. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the December FOMC meeting, the near-term fore-
cast was little changed from the projection prepared for 
the November meeting.  Real GDP growth in the sec-
ond half of 2016 was still expected to be faster than in 
the first half.  The staff’s forecast for real GDP growth 
over the next several years was slightly higher, on bal-
ance, largely reflecting the effects of the staff’s provi-
sional assumption that fiscal policy would be more ex-
pansionary in the coming years.  These effects were sub-
stantially counterbalanced by the restraint from the 
higher assumed paths for longer-term interest rates and 
the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The staff pro-
jected that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster 
pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019.  The 
unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually, 
on net, and to continue to run below the staff’s estimate 
of its longer-run natural rate through the end of 2019; 
the path for the unemployment rate was a little lower 
than in the previous projection. 

                                                 
6 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate. 

The near-term forecast for consumer price inflation was 
somewhat higher than in the previous projection, re-
flecting recent increases in energy prices.  Beyond the 
near term, the inflation forecast was little revised.  The 
staff continued to project that inflation would edge up 
over the next several years, as food and energy prices 
along with the prices of non-energy imports were ex-
pected to begin steadily rising in 2017.  However, infla-
tion was projected to be marginally below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to 
the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that mon-
etary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset 
large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones.  In 
addition, the staff continued to see the risks to the fore-
cast from developments abroad as skewed to the down-
side.  Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate 
demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the 
unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks to 
the projection for inflation were seen as roughly bal-
anced.  The downside risks from the possibility that 
longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower 
or that the dollar could appreciate more than anticipated 
were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk 
that inflation could increase more than expected in an 
economy that was projected to continue operating above 
its long-run potential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2016 through 2019 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.6  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes.

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, participants agreed that information received 
over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and that economic 
activity had been expanding at a moderate pace since 
midyear.  Job gains had been solid in recent months, and 
the unemployment rate had declined.  Household spend-
ing had been rising moderately, but business fixed in-
vestment remained soft.  Inflation had increased since 
earlier in the year but was still below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier 
declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-
ports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion had moved up considerably but still were low; most 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Participants expected that, with gradual adjustments in 
the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would 
expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions 
would strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation was ex-
pected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the 
transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and 
non-energy import prices dissipated and the labor mar-
ket strengthened further.  Participants indicated that re-
cently available economic data had been broadly in line 
with their expectations, and they judged that near-term 
risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly bal-
anced.  Moreover, participants generally made only mod-
est changes to their forecasts for real GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation.  About half of the 
participants incorporated an assumption of more expan-
sionary fiscal policy in their forecasts. 

In their discussion of their economic forecasts, partici-
pants emphasized their considerable uncertainty about 
the timing, size, and composition of any future fiscal and 
other economic policy initiatives as well as about how 
those policies might affect aggregate demand and sup-
ply.  Several participants pointed out that, depending on 
the mix of tax, spending, regulatory, and other possible 
policy changes, economic growth might turn out to be 
faster or slower than they currently anticipated.  How-
ever, almost all also indicated that the upside risks to 
their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a 
result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies 
in coming years.  Many participants underscored the 
need to continue to weigh other risks and uncertainties 
attending the economic outlook.  In that regard, several 
noted upside risks to U.S. economic activity from the 
potential for better-than-expected economic growth 
abroad or an acceleration of domestic business invest-

ment.  Among the downside risks cited were the possi-
bility of additional appreciation of the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar, financial vulnerabilities in some for-
eign economies, and the proximity of the federal funds 
rate to the effective lower bound.  Several participants 
also commented on the uncertainty about the outlook 
for productivity growth or about the potential effects of 
tight labor markets on labor supply and inflation.  For 
some participants, the greater upside risks to economic 
growth, the upward movement in inflation compensa-
tion over recent months, or the possibility of further in-
creases in oil prices had increased the upside risks to 
their inflation forecasts.  However, several others 
pointed out that a further rise in the dollar might con-
tinue to hold down inflation.  Participants generally 
agreed that they should continue to closely monitor in-
flation indicators and global economic and financial de-
velopments. 

Regarding the household sector, the available infor-
mation indicated that consumer spending had been ris-
ing at a moderate rate, on balance, since midyear.  Par-
ticipants cited a number of factors likely to support con-
tinued moderate gains in consumer spending.  Con-
sumer confidence remained positive.  The outlook was 
for further solid gains in jobs and income, and house-
hold balance sheets had improved.  The personal saving 
rate was still relatively high, and household wealth had 
been boosted by ongoing gains in housing and equity 
prices.  In the housing market, recent data on starts and 
permits for new residential construction suggested a 
firming in residential investment after two quarters of 
decline.  Several participants commented that housing 
activity appeared to be gaining momentum in their Dis-
tricts, and it was noted that the rate of new construction 
still appeared to be low relative to levels that would be 
expected based on the longer-run rate of household for-
mation. 

The outlook for the business sector improved over the 
intermeeting period.  Although nonresidential invest-
ment was still weak and equipment spending had been 
flat in the third quarter, orders for nondefense capital 
goods and the number of drilling rigs in operation had 
both turned up recently.  A couple of participants re-
ported plans for a pickup in capital spending by busi-
nesses in their Districts, driven by stronger demand and 
increasing revenues.  Surveys and information gathered 
from contacts in several Districts indicated an improve-
ment in manufacturing activity as well as expectations 
for further gains in factory production in the near term.  
And the recent firming in oil prices, if sustained, was an-

ticipated to boost domestic energy production.  In con-
trast, conditions in the agricultural sector remained de-
pressed, and a couple of reports highlighted softer activ-
ity in some service-sector industries.  More generally, 
participants reported that many of their District business 
contacts expressed greater optimism about the eco-
nomic outlook, and several participants commented that 
the improved sentiment could spur stronger investment 
spending.  Some contacts thought that their businesses 
could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, 
tax, and regulatory policies, while others were uncertain 
about the outlook for significant government policy 
changes or were concerned that their businesses might 
be adversely affected by some of the proposals under 
discussion. 

Labor market conditions continued to improve over the 
intermeeting period.  Monthly increases in nonfarm pay-
roll employment averaged nearly 180,000 over the three 
months ending in November, in line with the average 
pace of job creation over the past year.  The unemploy-
ment rate dropped markedly to 4.6 percent in Novem-
ber; a few participants suggested that part of the decline 
might be reversed in coming months.  Most participants 
viewed the cumulative progress in the labor market as 
having brought labor market conditions to or close to 
those consistent with the Committee’s maximum- 
employment objective.  Over the past year, broad 
measures of labor underutilization that include both the 
unemployed and workers marginally attached to the la-
bor force had trended lower, the labor force participa-
tion rate had been relatively steady despite downward 
pressure from demographic trends, and layoffs had 
fallen to low levels.  National surveys reported that job 
availability was high and that firms were increasingly 
finding their job openings hard to fill.  Some participants 
commented that some businesses in their Districts were 
experiencing shortages of skilled workers in some occu-
pations or were needing to offer higher wages to fill po-
sitions.  However, some others noted that aggregate 
measures of wages were still rising at a subdued pace, 
suggesting that upward pressure on wages had not be-
come widespread. 

Participants expected the labor market to strengthen 
somewhat further over the medium run, with almost all 
anticipating that the unemployment rate over the next 
couple of years would run below their estimates of its 
longer-run normal level.  Some participants saw the pos-
sibility that an extended period during which labor mar-
kets remained relatively tight could continue to shrink 
remaining margins of underutilization, including the 
still-high level of prime-age workers outside the labor 

force and elevated levels of involuntary part-time em-
ployment and long-duration unemployment.  A few 
added that continued gradual strengthening in labor 
markets would help return inflation to the Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  But some other participants were 
uncertain that a period of tight labor utilization would 
yield lasting labor market benefits or were concerned 
that it risked a buildup of inflationary pressures.  Most 
participants expected that if economic growth remained 
moderate, as they projected, the unemployment rate 
would be only modestly below their estimates of the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment over the next 
few years, but several anticipated a more substantial un-
dershoot.  A few participants noted the uncertainty sur-
rounding real-time estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment, and it was pointed out that geo-
graphic variation in labor market conditions contributed 
to that uncertainty.  In discussing the possible implica-
tions of a more significant undershooting of the longer-
run normal rate, many participants emphasized that, as 
the economic outlook evolved, timely adjustments to 
monetary policy could be required to achieve and main-
tain both the Committee’s maximum-employment and 
inflation objectives. 

Participants generally viewed the information on infla-
tion received over the intermeeting period as reinforcing 
their expectation that inflation would rise to the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The 
12-month change in the headline PCE price index 
moved up further to 1.4 percent in October, as the rise 
in energy prices since the spring offset much of the de-
cline earlier in the year.  Although the headline measure 
was still below 2 percent, it had increased more than 
1 percentage point over the past year.  Core PCE price 
inflation had also moved up moderately over the past 
year, and, over the 12 months ending in October, it was 
1.7 percent for a third consecutive month.  Median  
5-to-10-year inflation expectations in the Michigan sur-
vey were, on balance, stable in November and early De-
cember, just above the low recorded in October.   
Market-based measures of inflation compensation had 
moved up considerably over the intermeeting period.  A 
few participants added that other readings from financial 
markets, such as implied probabilities of various infla-
tion outcomes derived from inflation derivatives, pricing 
in the inflation swaps market, and the apparent upward 
shift of the estimated term premium in the 10-year 
Treasury yield, suggested that the risks to the inflation 
outlook had become more balanced around the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  A couple of par-
ticipants noted that the recent firming in oil prices might

have contributed to the changes in these market-based 
measures.  Several, however, pointed out that market-
based measures of inflation compensation were still low 
or that downside risks to inflation remained, given the 
recent further appreciation of the dollar. 

Most participants attributed the substantial changes in 
financial market conditions over the intermeeting pe-
riod—including the increase in longer-term interest 
rates, the strengthening of the dollar, the rise in equity 
prices, and the narrowing of credit spreads—to expecta-
tions for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming 
years or to possible reductions in corporate tax rates.  
Many participants expressed the need for caution in 
evaluating the implications of recent financial market de-
velopments for the economic outlook, in light of the un-
certainty about how federal spending, tax, and regulatory 
policies might unfold and how global economic and fi-
nancial conditions will evolve. 

In their consideration of economic conditions and mon-
etary policy, participants agreed that sufficient evidence 
had accumulated of continued progress toward the 
Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 
2 percent inflation to warrant an increase of 25 basis 
points in the target range for the federal funds rate at this 
meeting.  Participants judged that, even after the increase 
in the target range, the stance of policy would remain 
accommodative, consistent with some further strength-
ening in labor market conditions and a return of inflation 
to 2 percent over the medium term. 

Participants discussed the implications of the economic 
outlook for the likely future path of the target range for 
the federal funds rate.  Most participants judged that a 
gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropri-
ate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  A gradual pace was 
also viewed by some participants as likely to be war-
ranted because the proximity of the federal funds rate to 
the effective lower bound placed constraints on the abil-
ity of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to 
the aggregate demand for goods and services.  In addi-
tion, the neutral real rate—defined as the real interest 
rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary 
when the economy is operating at or near its potential—
still appeared to be low by historical standards, and it was 
noted that gradual increases in the federal funds rate 
over the next few years probably would be sufficient to 
return to a neutral policy stance. 

While viewing a gradual approach to policy firming as 
likely to be appropriate, participants emphasized the 
need to adjust the policy path as economic conditions 

evolved.  They pointed to a number of risks that, if real-
ized, might call for a different path of policy than they 
currently expected.  Moreover, uncertainty regarding fis-
cal and other economic policies had increased.  Partici-
pants agreed that it was too early to know what changes 
in these policies would be implemented and how such 
changes might alter the economic outlook.  It was also 
noted that fiscal and other policies were only some of 
the many factors that could influence the economic out-
look and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy.  
Moreover, many participants emphasized that the 
greater uncertainty about these policies made it more 
challenging to communicate to the public about the 
likely path of the federal funds rate.  Participants noted 
that, in the circumstances of heightened uncertainty, it 
was especially important that the Committee continue to 
underscore in its communications that monetary policy 
would continue to be set to promote attainment of the 
Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum employ-
ment and price stability. 

Many participants judged that the risk of a sizable under-
shooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate 
had increased somewhat and that the Committee might 
need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than 
currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershoot-
ing and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pres-
sures.  However, with inflation still below the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent objective, it was noted that downside 
risks to inflation remained and that a moderate under-
shooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate 
could help return inflation to 2 percent.  A couple of 
participants expressed concern that the Committee’s 
communications about a gradual pace of policy firming 
might be misunderstood as a commitment to only one 
or two rate hikes per year; participants agreed that policy 
would need to respond appropriately to the evolving 
outlook.  Several participants noted circumstances that 
might warrant changes to the path for the federal funds 
rate could also have implications for the reinvestment of 
proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and princi-
pal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed se-
curities. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in November indicated that 
the labor market had continued to strengthen and that 
economic activity had been expanding at a moderate 
pace since midyear.  Job gains had been solid in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate had declined.  
Household spending had been rising moderately, but

business fixed investment had remained soft.  Inflation 
had increased since earlier this year but was still below 
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly 
reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices 
of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation had moved up considerably but still 
were low; most survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations were little changed on balance. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market conditions would strengthen 
somewhat further.  They generally observed that labor 
market conditions had improved appreciably over the 
past year and that labor market slack had declined.  
Members agreed that there was heightened uncertainty 
about possible changes in fiscal and other economic pol-
icies as well as their effects.  However, members also 
agreed that near-term risks to the economic outlook ap-
peared roughly balanced.  Some members saw, with 
gradual adjustments of the stance of monetary policy, 
only modest risk of a scenario in which an undershoot-
ing of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment 
would create a sharp acceleration in prices.  These mem-
bers observed that inflation continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective and that wage gains had 
been subdued, and they expressed the view that inflation 
was likely to rise gradually, giving monetary policy time 
to respond if necessary.  Several members noted that if 
the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly 
more than expected, it might become necessary to adjust 
the Committee’s communications about the expected 
path of the federal funds rate, consistent with the possi-
bility that a less gradual pace of increases could become 
appropriate. 

At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, in-
flation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term as the transitory effects of past 
declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices 
dissipated and the labor market strengthened further.  
This view was reinforced by the rise in inflation in recent 
months and by recent increases in inflation compensa-
tion.  Against this backdrop and in light of the current 
shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, members agreed 
that they would continue to closely monitor actual and 
expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation 
goal. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, members agreed to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent.  
This increase in the target range was viewed as appropri-
ate in light of the considerable progress that had been 
made toward the Committee’s objective of maximum 
employment and, in view of the rise in inflation since 
earlier in the year, the Committee’s confidence that in-
flation would rise to 2 percent in the medium term.  
Members judged that, even after this increase in the tar-
get range, the stance of monetary policy remained ac-
commodative, thereby supporting some further 
strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 
2 percent inflation. 

The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its objectives of maxi-
mum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-
ment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  The Committee expected that economic con-
ditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that 
the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the 
longer run.  However, members emphasized that the ac-
tual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the 
economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  Members noted 
that this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective December 15, 2016, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of ½ to ¾ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 0.50 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in November indicates 
that the labor market has continued to 
strengthen and that economic activity has been 
expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year.  
Job gains have been solid in recent months and 
the unemployment rate has declined.  House-
hold spending has been rising moderately but 
business fixed investment has remained soft. In-
flation has increased since earlier this year but is 
still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-
run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-
ports. Market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation have moved up considerably but still 
are low; most survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations are little changed, on 
balance, in recent months. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 
with gradual adjustments in the stance of mon-
etary policy, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market conditions will 
strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation is ex-
pected to rise to 2 percent over the medium 

term as the transitory effects of past declines in 
energy and import prices dissipate and the labor 
market strengthens further.  Near-term risks to 
the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  
The Committee continues to closely monitor 
inflation indicators and global economic and fi-
nancial developments. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a return to 2 per-
cent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  In light of the current shortfall of 
inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress 
toward its inflation goal.  The Committee ex-
pects that economic conditions will evolve in a 
manner that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate 
is likely to remain, for some time, below levels 
that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the federal funds 
rate will depend on the economic outlook as in-
formed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.”

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 13–14, 2016, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2016 to 
2019 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s pro-
jection was based on information available at the time of 
the meeting, together with his or her assessment of ap-
propriate monetary policy, including a path for the fed-
eral funds rate and its longer-run value, and assumptions 
about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.  
The longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the value to which each variable would be 
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to 
the economy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined 
as the future path of policy that each participant deems 
most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and 
inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpreta-
tion of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum 
employment and stable prices. 

Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropri-
ate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) would pick up a bit next year and run at or 
slightly above their individual estimates of its longer-run 
rate through 2019.  Almost all participants projected that 
the unemployment rate would run below their estimates 
of its longer-run normal level in 2017 and remain below 
that level through 2019.  All participants projected that 
inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), would increase over the next two 
years, and several expected inflation to slightly exceed 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2018 or 2019.  
Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the 
projections. 

As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected 
that the evolution of economic conditions would war-
rant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate to 
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  Many participants judged that the appro-
priate level of the federal funds rate in 2019 would be 
close to their estimates of its longer-run normal level.  
However, the economic outlook is uncertain, and partic-

                                                 
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate. 

ipants noted that their economic projections and assess-
ments of appropriate monetary policy may change in re-
sponse to incoming information.  

A majority of participants viewed the level of uncertainty 
associated with their individual forecasts for economic 
growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar 
to the norms of the previous 20 years, though some par-
ticipants saw uncertainty associated with their forecasts 
as higher than average.  Most participants also judged the 
risks around their projections for economic activity, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced, 
while several participants saw the risks to their forecasts 
of real GDP growth as weighted to the upside and the 
risks to their unemployment rate forecasts as tilted to the 
downside.   

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-
sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 
1.9 percent in 2016, 2.1 percent in 2017, 2.0 percent in 
2018, and 1.9 percent in 2019; the median of projections 
for the longer-run normal rate of real GDP growth was 
1.8 percent.  Most participants projected that economic 
growth would pick up a bit in 2017 from the current 
year’s pace and run at or slightly above their individual 
estimates of its longer-run rate through 2019.  Compared 
with the September Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP), the medians of the projections for real GDP 
growth were slightly higher over the period from 2017 
to 2019, while the median assessment of the longer-run 
growth rate was unchanged.  Since September, almost 
half of the participants revised up their projections for 
real GDP growth in 2018 or 2019, generally only slightly.  
Those increasing their projections for output growth in 
those years cited expected changes in fiscal, regulatory, 
or other policies as factors contributing to their revi-
sions.  However, many participants noted that the effects 
on the economy of such policy changes, if implemented, 
would likely be partially offset by tighter financial condi-
tions, including higher longer-term interest rates and a 
strengthening of the dollar. 

The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7 percent, slightly lower 
than in September.  Based on the median projections,

submit longer-run projections for the federal funds rate.

the anticipated path of the unemployment rate for com-
ing years also shifted down a bit, with the median for the 
end of 2019 at 4.5 percent, 0.3 percentage point below 
the median assessment of the longer-run normal rate of 
unemployment, which was unchanged from September.    

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2016 to 2019 and in the longer run.  
The distributions of individual projections of real GDP 
growth shifted slightly higher relative to the distribution 
of the September projections for 2017 through 2019.  
The distributions of projections for the unemployment 
rate shifted modestly lower for 2016 through 2019, while 
the distribution of projections for the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment was unchanged. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
In the December SEP, the median of projections for 
headline PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1.5 percent, a 
bit higher than in September.  The median of projections 
for headline PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent in 2017 
and 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019, unchanged from Sep-
tember.  Several participants projected that inflation will 
slightly exceed the Committee’s objective in 2018 or 
2019.  The medians of projections for core PCE price 
inflation were the same as in September, rising from 
1.7 percent in 2016 to 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2.0 per-
cent in 2018 and 2019. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The distributions of projections for headline and 
core PCE price inflation shifted up slightly relative to 
projections for the September meeting.  Some partici-
pants attributed the upward shift in projected inflation 
this year and next to recent data that showed somewhat 
higher inflation than they had expected.  A few saw 
higher inflation in 2019 in conjunction with somewhat 
greater undershooting of the unemployment rate below 
its longer-run normal level. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target for the fed-
eral funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 2019 
and over the longer run.2  All participants saw an in-
crease of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at the 

                                                 
2 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were in-
formed by the view that there are multiple possible medium-
term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are per-
sistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way 

December meeting as appropriate.  The distributions for 
2017 through 2019 shifted up modestly.  The median 
projections of the federal funds rate continued to show 
gradual increases, to 1.4 percent at the end of 2017, 
2.1 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.9 percent at the end 
of 2019; the median of the longer-run projections of the 
federal funds rate was 3.0 percent.  The medians of the 
projections for the level of the federal funds rate for 
2017 through 2019 were all 25 basis points higher than 
in the September projections.  A few participants revised 
up their assessments of the longer-run federal funds rate 
25 basis points, resulting in an increase in the median of 
13 basis points.   

In discussing their December forecasts, many partici-
pants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds 
rate over the next few years would likely be gradual in 
light of a short-term neutral real interest rate that cur-
rently was low—a phenomenon that a number of partic-
ipants attributed to the persistence of low productivity 
growth, continued strength of the dollar, a weak outlook 
for economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe 
longer-term assets, or other factors—and that was likely 
to rise only slowly as the effects of these factors faded 
over time.  Some participants noted the continued prox-
imity of short-term nominal interest rates to the effective 
lower bound, even with an increase at this meeting, as 
limiting the Committee’s ability to increase monetary ac-
commodation to counter possible adverse shocks to the 
economy.  These participants judged that, as a result, the 
Committee should take a cautious approach to removing 
policy accommodation.  Many participants noted that 
there was currently substantial uncertainty about the 
size, composition, and timing of prospective fiscal policy 
changes, but they also commented that a more expan-
sionary fiscal policy might raise aggregate demand above 
sustainable levels, potentially necessitating somewhat 
tighter monetary policy than currently anticipated.  Fur-
thermore, several participants indicated that recent infla-
tion data and the continued strengthening in labor mar-
ket conditions increased their confidence that inflation 
would move toward the 2 percent objective, making a 
slightly firmer path of monetary policy appropriate. 
 
 
 

that cannot be forecast.  Under this view, the economy cur-
rently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic 
activity with low productivity growth and a low short-term real 
interest rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other 
than inflation cannot be usefully projected.

were released in the winter by various private and government fore-
casters.  (The note to this table that was included in the Summary of 
Economic Projections for the meeting of September 20–21, 2016, in-

Uncertainty and Risks 
The left-hand column of figure 4 shows that, for each 
variable, a majority of participants judged the levels of 
uncertainty associated with their December projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline 
inflation, and core inflation to be broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years.3  However, more partici-
pants than in September saw uncertainty surrounding 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or inflation 
as higher than average.  Many participants mentioned an 

                                                 
3 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the 
change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1996 through 2015.  
At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 

increase in uncertainty associated with fiscal, trade, im-
migration, or regulatory policies as a factor influencing 
their judgments about the degree of uncertainty sur-
rounding their projections.  Participants cited the diffi-
culty of predicting the size, composition, and timing of 
these policy changes as well as the magnitude and timing 
of their effects on the economy. 

As can be seen in the right-hand column of figure 4, a 
majority of participants continued to see the risks to real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline infla-
tion, and core inflation as broadly balanced; however, 
fewer participants saw risks to economic growth and in-
flation as weighted to the downside or saw risks to the 
unemployment rate as weighted to the upside than in 
September.  A number of participants noted that the 
prospect of expansionary fiscal policy had increased the 
upside risks to economic activity and inflation, and a few 
assessed the possibility of a reduction in regulation as 
posing upside risks to their forecasts of economic activ-
ity.  Moreover, some participants judged that the recent 
rise in market-based measures of inflation compensation 
suggested that downside risks to inflation had declined.  
However, many also pointed to various sources of 
downside risk to economic activity, such as the limited 
potential for monetary policy to respond to adverse 
shocks when the federal funds rate is near the effective 
lower bound, downside risks in Europe and China, a 
possible increase in trade barriers, and the possibility of 
a sharp rise in financial market volatility in the event that 
fiscal and other policy changes diverged from market ex-
pectations.  In addition, some participants pointed to 
factors such as global disinflationary trends and down-
ward pressure on import prices from further strengthen-
ing of the dollar as sources of downside risk to inflation.

economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the 
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform 
discussions of monetary policy among policy-
makers and can aid public understanding of the 
basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-
tainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relation-
ships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the 
real world, and the future path of the economy 
can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-
ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely eco-
nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-
tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-
ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they oc-
cur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-
tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate 
the considerable uncertainty associated with 
economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that ex-
perienced in the past and the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported in table 2 would imply a probability of 
about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-
pand within a range of  2.1 to 3.9 percent in the 

current year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in the second 
year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third and 
fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent 
confidence intervals for overall inflation would 
be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
3.0 in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in 
the third and fourth years. 

Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, 
participants provide judgments as to whether 
the uncertainty attached to their projections of 
each variable is greater than, smaller than, or 
broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-
certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-
ipants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the up-
side, are weighted to the downside, or are 
broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge 
whether each variable is more likely to be above 
or below their projections of the most likely out-
come.  These judgments about the uncertainty 
and the risks attending each participant’s projec-
tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-
pants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks 
associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of differ-
ent projections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-
certainty arises primarily because each partici-
pant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  
If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected 
manner, then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change 
from that point forward.
