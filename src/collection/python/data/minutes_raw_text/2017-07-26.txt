Selection of Committee Officer 
By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Mark E. 
Van Der Weide to serve as general counsel, effective at 
the time he becomes the Board of Governors’ general 
counsel, until the selection of his successor at the first 
regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2018. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets over the period since the June 
FOMC meeting.  The intermeeting period was relatively 
uneventful.  Bond yields in advanced economies in-
creased moderately, in part reflecting evolving market 
perceptions of prospects for foreign monetary policies.  
U.S. bond yields rose to a smaller degree, and the value 
of the dollar on foreign exchange markets decreased.  
Implied volatility in fixed-income markets remained low.  
Equity prices rose further, with notable advances in in-
dexes for emerging markets. 

The increase in the FOMC’s target range for the federal 
funds rate at the June meeting was reflected in other 
money market interest rates, and the effective federal 
funds rate was near the middle of the new target range 
over the intermeeting period except on quarter-end.  

Take-up at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement facility averaged about $200 billion.  Condi-
tions in foreign exchange swap markets were fairly sta-
ble, and demand at central bank dollar auctions was rel-
atively low.  The manager also reported on small-value 
tests of open market operations, which are conducted 
routinely to promote operational readiness. 

Market expectations for the path of the federal funds 
rate were little changed.  Survey evidence suggested that 
most market participants now anticipated that the 
FOMC would announce at its September meeting a date 
for implementation of a change in reinvestment policy, 
although a couple of survey respondents expressed the 
view that the timing could be affected by developments 
regarding the federal debt ceiling.  The survey results 
also suggested that, while views were somewhat dis-
persed, respondents typically expected effects on bond 
yields and spreads on mortgage-backed securities from 
the change in reinvestment policy to be modest. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet-
ing period.  There were no intervention operations in 
foreign currencies for the System’s account during the 
intermeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the July 25–26 meeting 
showed that labor market conditions continued to 
strengthen in June and that real gross domestic product 
(GDP) likely expanded at a faster pace in the second 
quarter than in the first quarter.  The 12-month change 
in overall consumer prices, as measured by the price in-
dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
slowed again in May; both total consumer price inflation 
and core inflation, which excludes consumer food and 
energy prices, were running below 2 percent.  Data from 
the consumer and producer price indexes for June sug-
gested that both total and core PCE price inflation (on a 
12-month change basis) remained at a pace similar to 
that seen in the previous month.  Survey-based measures 
of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed 
on balance. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in 
June, and the average monthly pace of private-sector job 
gains over the first half of the year was essentially the 
same as last year.  The unemployment rate edged up to 
4.4 percent in June; the unemployment rates for African 
Americans and for Hispanics declined slightly but re-
mained above the unemployment rates for Asians and 
for whites.  In addition, the median length of time that 
unemployed African Americans had been out of work 

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

exceeded the comparable figures for whites and for His-
panics, a pattern that has prevailed for at least the past 
two decades.  The overall labor force participation rate 
edged up in June, and the share of workers employed 
part time for economic reasons rose a bit.  The rate of 
private-sector job openings decreased in May after hav-
ing risen for a couple of months, while the quits rate and 
the hiring rate both increased.  The four-week moving 
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits remained at a very low level through mid-July.  
Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 
2½ percent over the 12 months ending in June, about 
the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but 
a little slower than the rate of increase in late 2016. 

Total industrial production rose moderately, on balance, 
in May and June, as an increase in the output of mines 
and utilities more than offset a net decline in manufac-
turing production.  Automakers’ assembly schedules in-
dicated that motor vehicle production would edge down 
again in the third quarter, likely reflecting a somewhat 
elevated level of dealers’ inventories and a slowing in the 
pace of vehicle sales last quarter.  However, broader in-
dicators of manufacturing production, such as the new 
orders indexes from national and regional manufactur-
ing surveys, pointed to moderate gains in factory output 
over the near term. 

Real PCE appeared to have rebounded in the second 
quarter after increasing only modestly in the first quarter.  
Much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated 
in spending on energy services and energy goods, which 
was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in 
the year.  The components of the nominal retail sales 
data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to con-
struct its estimate of PCE declined in June but rose, on 
net, in the second quarter.  Light motor vehicle sales 
edged down further in June.  However, recent readings 
on key factors that influence consumer spending— 
including continued gains in employment, real disposa-
ble personal income, and households’ net worth—
pointed to solid growth in total real PCE in the near 
term.  Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Univer-
sity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained up-
beat despite having moved down in early July. 

Residential investment seemed to have declined in the 
second quarter.  Starts of both new single-family homes 
and multifamily units rose in June but still decreased for 
the second quarter as a whole.  The issuance of building 
permits for both types of housing was lower in the sec-
ond quarter than in the first quarter.  Sales of existing 
homes decreased, on net, in May and June, and new 

home sales in May partly reversed the previous month’s 
decline. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to have increased moder-
ately in the second quarter after a solid gain in the first 
quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft rose again in May, and new or-
ders of these goods continued to exceed shipments, 
pointing to further gains in shipments in the near term.  
In addition, indicators of business sentiment remained 
upbeat.  Investment in nonresidential structures ap-
peared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the 
second quarter than in the first.  Firms’ nominal spend-
ing for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and 
mining declined further in May, and the number of oil 
and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector, leveled out 
in recent weeks after increasing steadily for the past year. 

Nominal outlays for defense through June pointed to an 
increase in real federal government purchases in the sec-
ond quarter.  However, real purchases by state and local 
governments appeared to have declined.  Payrolls for 
state and local governments expanded during the second 
quarter, but nominal construction spending by these 
governments decreased, on net, in April and May. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in 
May, with an increase in exports and a small decline in 
imports.  Export growth was led by consumer goods, 
automotive products, and services.  The import decline 
was driven by consumer goods and automotive prod-
ucts.  The available data suggested that net exports were 
a slight drag on real GDP growth in the second quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1½ percent over the 12 months 
ending in May.  Core PCE price inflation was also 
1½ percent over that same period.  Over the 12 months 
ending in June, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 
1½ percent, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent.  
The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 
10 years from the Michigan survey edged up both in June 
and in the preliminary reading for July.  Other measures 
of longer-run inflation expectations were generally little 
changed, on balance, in recent months, although those 
from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey 
of Market Participants had ticked down recently. 

Incoming data suggested that economic growth contin-
ued to firm abroad, especially among advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs).  The pickup in advanced-economy 
demand also contributed to relatively strong growth in

China and emerging Asia, but growth in Latin America 
remained relatively weak, partly reflecting tight monetary 
and fiscal policies.  Despite the stronger momentum of 
economic activity in the AFEs, headline inflation de-
clined sharply in the second quarter, largely reflecting 
lower retail energy prices, and core inflation stayed sub-
dued in many AFEs.  Although inflation was also low in 
most emerging market economies (EMEs), it remained 
elevated in Mexico because of rising food inflation and 
earlier peso depreciation. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial market conditions remained gener-
ally accommodative over the intermeeting period.  U.S. 
equity prices rose, longer-term Treasury yields increased 
slightly, and the dollar depreciated.  The Committee’s 
decision to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate to 1 to 1¼ percent at the June meeting was widely 
anticipated in financial markets, and market participants 
reportedly viewed FOMC communications as largely in 
line with expectations.  Financing conditions for nonfi-
nancial businesses and households generally remained 
supportive of growth in spending. 

FOMC communications over the intermeeting period 
were viewed as broadly in line with investors’ expecta-
tions that the Committee would continue to remove pol-
icy accommodation at a gradual pace.  Market partici-
pants generally interpreted the information on reinvest-
ment policy provided in June in the Committee’s 
postmeeting statement and its Addendum to the Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans as consistent with 
their expectation that a change to reinvestment policy 
was likely to occur this year.  Market participants also 
took note of the summary in the June minutes of the 
Committee’s discussion of the progress toward the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective 
and the extent to which recent softness in price data re-
flected idiosyncratic factors.  Overnight index swap rates 
pointed to little change in the expected path of the fed-
eral funds rate on net. 

Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treas-
ury securities increased slightly over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Although yields fell following the publication of 
lower-than-expected CPI data, yields were boosted by 
comments from foreign central bank officials that inves-
tors read as pointing to less accommodative monetary 
policies abroad than previously expected.  Measures of 
inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities ticked up since the June FOMC 
meeting.  Despite their intermeeting period gains, 
longer-term real and nominal Treasury yields remained 

very low by historical standards, apparently weighed 
down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and 
possibly by declines in the long-term neutral real interest 
rate over recent years. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose.  One-month-ahead 
option-implied volatility of the S&P 500 index—the 
VIX—remained at historically low levels.  Spreads of 
yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial 
corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury se-
curities narrowed a bit on net. 

Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Reflecting the FOMC’s 
policy action in June, yields on a broad set of money 
market instruments moved about 25 basis points higher.  
However, over much of the period, the net increase in 
rates on shorter-dated Treasury bills was smaller, report-
edly reflecting a reduction in Treasury bill supply. 

Financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily 
available, although debt issuance moderated.  Gross is-
suance of corporate bonds stepped down in June from 
a strong pace in May, while issuance of institutional lev-
eraged loans continued to be robust.  Commercial and 
industrial lending by banks remained quite weak in the 
second quarter.  Responses from the July Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
(SLOOS) indicated that depressed demand was largely 
responsible, and that banks’ lending standards were little 
changed in recent months.  The most cited reason for 
the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment 
spending by nonfinancial businesses, but banks also re-
ported that some borrowers had shifted to other sources 
of external financing or to internally generated funds. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
remained accommodative, although the growth of CRE 
loans on banks’ books slowed somewhat.  Respondents 
to the July SLOOS reported tightening credit standards 
for these loans.  SLOOS respondents also reported that 
standards on CRE loans were tight relative to their his-
torical range, and that, on net, demand for CRE loans 
weakened in recent months.  The pace of issuance of 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
through the first half of the year was similar to that seen 
last year.  Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools 
originated before the financial crisis continued to in-
crease. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
were little changed, and flows of new credit continued at 
a moderate pace.  However, growth of mortgage loans 
on banks’ books slowed somewhat in the first half of this 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

year.  SLOOS respondents, on net, reported that stand-
ards on most residential mortgage loan categories eased 
slightly. 

Consumer credit continued to grow on a year-over-year 
basis, but the expansion of credit card and auto loan bal-
ances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was ev-
ident through the end of last year.  In the July SLOOS, 
banks reported having tightened standards and widened 
spreads for credit card and auto loans on net.  Standards 
for the subprime segments of these loan types were par-
ticularly tight compared with their historical ranges.  Re-
flecting in part continued tightening of lending  
standards, consumer loan growth at banks moderated 
further in the second quarter; however, that weakness 
was partially offset by more robust lending by credit un-
ions.  

Since the June FOMC meeting, the broad dollar depre-
ciated 2 percent, weakening more against AFE curren-
cies than against EME currencies.  The dollar’s depreci-
ation was driven in part by policy communications from 
the central banks of several AFEs that market partici-
pants viewed as less accommodative than expected as 
well as by weaker-than-expected CPI data in the United 
States.  The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate in July.  
Sovereign yields increased notably in Canada, Germany, 
and the United Kingdom.  Changes in foreign equity in-
dexes were mixed over the intermeeting period:  Euro-
pean equities edged lower, Japanese equities were little 
changed, and EME equities increased.  European pe-
ripheral sovereign bond spreads narrowed over the pe-
riod, reflecting in part positive sentiment related to the 
outcomes of the French parliamentary election, Greek 
debt negotiations, and bank resolutions in Italy.  EME 
sovereign spreads were little changed on net. 

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability, indicating that it continued to judge 
the vulnerabilities of the U.S financial system as moder-
ate on balance.  This overall assessment incorporated the 
staff’s judgment that, since the April assessment, vulner-
abilities associated with asset valuation pressures had 
edged up from notable to elevated, as asset prices re-
mained high or climbed further, risk spreads narrowed, 
and expected and actual volatility remained muted in a 
range of financial markets.  However, the staff continued 
to view vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage 
as well as maturity and liquidity transformation as low, 
and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sec-
tor appeared to remain moderate. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the July FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the pre-
vious forecast.  In particular, real GDP growth, which 
was modest in the first quarter, was still expected to have 
stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to 
maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second 
half of the year.  In this projection, the staff scaled back 
its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of 
fiscal policy expansion in the coming years.  However, 
the effect of this change on the projection for real GDP 
over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower 
assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and 
for longer-term interest rates.  Thus, as in the June pro-
jection, the staff projected that real GDP would expand 
at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 
2017 through 2019.  The unemployment rate was pro-
jected to decline gradually over the next couple of years 
and to continue running below the staff’s estimate of its 
longer-run natural rate over this period. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as 
measured by the change in the PCE price index, was re-
vised down slightly for 2017 in response to weaker-than-
expected incoming data for inflation.  As a result, infla-
tion this year was expected to be similar in magnitude to 
last year, with an upturn in the prices for food and non-
energy imports offset by a slower increase in core PCE 
prices and weaker energy prices.  Beyond 2017, the fore-
cast was little revised from the previous projection, as 
the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory.  
The staff continued to project that inflation would in-
crease in the next couple of years and that it would be 
close to the Committee’s longer-run objective in 2018 
and at 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  On 
the one hand, many financial market indicators of uncer-
tainty remained subdued, and the uncertainty associated 
with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than 
late last year; on the other hand, uncertainty about the 
direction of some economic policies was judged to have 
remained elevated.  The staff saw the risks to the fore-
casts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate 
as balanced.  The risks to the projection for inflation also 
were seen as balanced.  Downside risks included the pos-
sibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may 
have edged down, that the dollar could appreciate sub-
stantially, or that the recent run of soft inflation readings 
could prove to be more persistent than the staff ex-
pected.  These downside risks were seen as essentially

counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could 
increase more than expected in an economy that was 
projected to continue operating above its longer-run po-
tential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had been rising moderately so far this 
year.  Job gains had been solid, on average, since the be-
ginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had de-
clined, on net, over the same period.  Household spend-
ing and business fixed investment had continued to ex-
pand.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and 
the measure excluding food and energy prices had de-
clined and were running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low;  
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed on balance. 

Participants generally saw the incoming information on 
spending and labor market indicators as consistent, 
overall, with their expectations and indicated that their 
views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor 
market were little changed, on balance, since the June 
FOMC meeting.  Participants continued to expect that, 
with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary pol-
icy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace 
and labor market conditions would strengthen some-
what further.  In light of continued low recent readings 
on inflation, participants expected that inflation on a 
12-month basis would remain somewhat below 2 per-
cent in the near term.  However, most participants 
judged that inflation would stabilize around the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. 

Data received over the intermeeting period reinforced 
earlier indications that real GDP growth had turned up 
after having been slow in the first quarter of this year.  
As anticipated, growth in household spending appeared 
to have been stronger in the second quarter after its first-
quarter weakness.  Reports from District contacts on 
consumer spending were generally positive.  However, 
sales of motor vehicles had softened, and automakers 
were reportedly adjusting production and assessing 
whether the underlying demand for automobiles had de-
clined.  Participants noted that the fundamentals under-
pinning consumption growth, including increases in pay-
rolls, remained solid.  However, the weakness in retail 
sales in June offered a note of caution. 

Reports from District contacts on both manufacturing 
and services were also generally consistent with moder-
ate growth in economic activity overall.  Construction-
sector contacts were generally upbeat.  Reports on the 
energy sector indicated that activity was continuing to 
expand, albeit more slowly than previously; survey evi-
dence suggested that oil drilling remained profitable in 
some locations at current oil prices.  The agricultural sec-
tor remained weak, and some regions were experiencing 
drought conditions.  A couple of participants had re-
ceived indications from contacts that business invest-
ment spending in their Districts might strengthen. 

Nevertheless, several participants noted that uncertainty 
about the course of federal government policy, including 
in the areas of fiscal policy, trade, and health care, was 
tending to weigh down firms’ spending and hiring plans.  
In addition, a few participants suggested that the likeli-
hood of near-term enactment of a fiscal stimulus pro-
gram had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus 
likely would be smaller than they previously expected.  It 
was also observed that the budgets of some state and 
local governments were under strain, limiting growth in 
their expenditures.  In contrast, the prospects for U.S. 
exports had been boosted by a brighter international 
economic outlook. 

Participants noted that labor market conditions had 
strengthened further over the intermeeting period.  The 
unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.4 percent in June 
but remained low by historical standards.  Payroll gains 
picked up substantially in June.  In addition, the  
employment-to-population ratio increased.  Participants 
observed that the unemployment rate was likely close to 
or below its longer-run normal rate and could decline 
further if, as expected, growth in output remained some-
what in excess of the potential growth rate.  A few par-
ticipants expressed concerns about the possibility of 
substantially overshooting full employment, with one 
citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing.  Dis-
trict contacts confirmed tightness in the labor market 
but relayed little evidence of wage pressures, although 
some firms were reportedly attempting to attract work-
ers with a variety of nonwage benefits.  The absence of 
sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by 
most aggregate wage measures.  However, a few partici-
pants suggested that, in a tight labor market, measured 
aggregate wage growth was being held down by compo-
sitional changes in employment associated with the hir-
ing of less experienced workers at lower wages than 
those of established workers.  In addition, a number of 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

participants suggested that the rate of increase in nomi-
nal wages was not low in relation to the rate of produc-
tivity growth and the modest rate of inflation.  

Participants discussed the softness in inflation in recent 
months.  Many participants noted that much of the re-
cent decline in inflation had probably reflected idiosyn-
cratic factors.  Nonetheless, PCE price inflation on a 
12-month basis would likely continue to be held down 
over the second half of the year by the effects of those 
factors, and the monthly readings might be depressed by 
possible residual seasonality in measured PCE inflation.  
Still, most participants indicated that they expected in-
flation to pick up over the next couple of years from its 
current low level and to stabilize around the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Many 
participants, however, saw some likelihood that inflation 
might remain below 2 percent for longer than they cur-
rently expected, and several indicated that the risks to 
the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside.  
Participants agreed that a fall in longer-term inflation ex-
pectations would be undesirable, but they differed in 
their assessments of whether inflation expectations were 
well anchored.  One participant pointed to the stability 
of a number of measures of inflation expectations in re-
cent months, but a few others suggested that continuing 
low inflation expectations may have been a factor put-
ting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation ex-
pectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure 
their consistency with the Committee’s longer-term in-
flation objective. 

A number of participants noted that much of the analy-
sis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a frame-
work in which, for a given rate of expected inflation, the 
degree of upward pressures on prices and wages rose as 
aggregate demand for goods and services and employ-
ment of resources increased above long-run sustainable 
levels.  A few participants cited evidence suggesting that 
this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting 
inflation.  However, most participants thought that the 
framework remained valid, notwithstanding the recent 
absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tighten-
ing labor market and real GDP growth in excess of their 
estimates of its potential rate.  Participants discussed 
possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and 
low unemployment.  These included a diminished re-
sponsiveness of prices to resource pressures, a lower 
natural rate of unemployment, the possibility that slack 
may be better measured by labor market indicators other 
than unemployment, lags in the reaction of nominal 
wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening, 

and restraints on pricing power from global develop-
ments and from innovations to business models spurred 
by advances in technology.  A couple of participants ar-
gued that the response of inflation to resource utilization 
could become stronger if output and employment ap-
preciably overshot their full employment levels, 
although other participants pointed out that this hypoth-
esized nonlinear response had little empirical support. 

In assessing recent developments in financial market 
conditions, participants referred to the continued low 
level of longer-term interest rates, in particular those on 
U.S Treasury securities.  The level of such yields ap-
peared to reflect both low expected future short-term in-
terest rates and depressed term premiums.  Asset pur-
chases by foreign central banks and the Federal Re-
serve’s securities holdings were also likely contributing 
to currently low term premiums, although the exact size 
of these contributions was uncertain.  A number of par-
ticipants pointed to potential concerns about low longer-
term interest rates, including the possibility that inflation 
expectations were too low, that yields could rise  
abruptly, or that low yields were inducing investors to 
take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns. 

Several participants noted that the further increases in 
equity prices, together with continued low longer-term 
interest rates, had led to an easing of financial condi-
tions.  However, different assessments were expressed 
about the implications of this development for the out-
look for aggregate demand and, consequently, appropri-
ate monetary policy.  According to one view, the easing 
of financial conditions meant that the economic effects 
of the Committee’s actions in gradually removing policy 
accommodation had been largely offset by other factors 
influencing financial markets, and that a tighter mone-
tary policy than otherwise was warranted.  According to 
another view, recent rises in equity prices might be part 
of a broad-based adjustment of asset prices to changes 
in longer-term financial conditions, importantly includ-
ing a lower neutral real interest rate, and, therefore, the 
recent equity price increases might not provide much ad-
ditional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and ser-
vices. 

Participants also considered equity valuations in their 
discussion of financial stability.  A couple of participants 
noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided 
backing for current equity valuations; in addition, as re-
cent equity price increases did not seem to stem im-
portantly from greater use of leverage by investors, these 
increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial 
stability.  Several participants observed that the banking

system was well capitalized and had ample liquidity, re-
ducing the risk of financial instability.  It was noted that 
financial stability assessments were based on current 
capital levels within the banking sector, and that such as-
sessments would likely be adjusted should these 
measures of loss-absorbing capacity change.  Partici-
pants underscored the need to monitor financial institu-
tions for shifts in behavior—such as an erosion of lend-
ing standards or increased reliance on unstable sources 
of funding—that could lead to subsequent problems.  In 
addition, participants judged that it was important to 
look for signs that either declining market volatility or 
heavy concentration by investors in particular assets 
might create financial imbalances.  A couple of partici-
pants expressed concern that smaller banks could be as-
suming significant risks in efforts to expand their CRE 
lending.  Furthermore, a couple of participants saw, as 
possible sources of financial instability, the pace of in-
crease in real estate prices in the multifamily segment 
and the pattern of the lending and borrowing activities 
of certain government-sponsored enterprises. 

Participants agreed that the regulatory and supervisory 
tools developed since the financial crisis had played an 
important role in fostering financial stability.  Changes 
in regulation had likely helped in making the banking 
system more resilient to major shocks, in promoting 
more prudent balance sheet management strategies on 
the part of nonbank financial institutions, and in reduc-
ing the degree to which variations in lending to the pri-
vate sector intensify cycles in output and in asset prices.  
Participants agreed that it would not be desirable for the 
current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that 
allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that 
contributed to the crisis. 

In their discussion of monetary policy, participants reaf-
firmed their view that a gradual approach to removing 
policy accommodation was likely to remain appropriate 
to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  Participants com-
mented on a number of factors that would influence 
their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for 
the federal funds rate.  Most saw the outlook for eco-
nomic activity and the labor market as little changed 
from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate 
that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  However, 
some participants expressed concern about the recent 
decline in inflation, which had occurred even as resource 
utilization had tightened, and noted their increased un-
certainty about the outlook for inflation.  They observed 

that the Committee could afford to be patient under cur-
rent circumstances in deciding when to increase the fed-
eral funds rate further and argued against additional ad-
justments until incoming information confirmed that the 
recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist 
and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the 
medium term.  In contrast, some other participants were 
more worried about risks arising from a labor market 
that had already reached full employment and was pro-
jected to tighten further or from the easing in financial 
conditions that had developed since the Committee’s 
policy normalization process was initiated in December 
2015.  They cautioned that a delay in gradually removing 
policy accommodation could result in an overshooting 
of the Committee’s inflation objective that would likely 
be costly to reverse, or that a delay could lead to an in-
tensification of financial stability risks or to other imbal-
ances that might prove difficult to unwind.  One partic-
ipant stressed that the risks both to the Committee’s in-
flation objective and to financial stability would require 
careful monitoring.  This participant expressed the view 
that a gradual approach to removing policy accommoda-
tion would likely strike the appropriate balance between 
promoting the Committee’s inflation and full employ-
ment objectives and mitigating financial stability con-
cerns. 

A number of participants also commented that the ap-
propriate pace of normalization of the federal funds rate 
would depend on how financial conditions evolved and 
on the implications of those developments for the pace 
of economic activity.  Among the considerations men-
tioned were the extent of current downward pressure on 
longer-term yields arising from the Federal Reserve’s as-
set holdings and how this pressure would diminish over 
time as balance sheet normalization proceeded, the 
strength and degree of persistence of other domestic and 
global factors that had contributed to the easing of fi-
nancial conditions and elevated asset prices, and whether 
and how much the neutral rate of interest would rise as 
the economy continued to expand. 

Participants also discussed the appropriate time to im-
plement the plan for reducing the Federal Reserve’s se-
curities holdings that was announced in June in the 
Committee’s postmeeting statement and its Addendum 
to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  Par-
ticipants generally agreed that, in light of their current 
assessment of economic conditions and the outlook, it 
was appropriate to signal that implementation of the 
program likely would begin relatively soon, absent sig-

nificant adverse developments in the economy or in fi-
nancial markets.  Many noted that the program was ex-
pected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in 
policy accommodation.  Several reiterated that, once the 
program was under way, further adjustments to the 
stance of monetary policy in response to economic de-
velopments would be centered on changes in the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  Although several par-
ticipants were prepared to announce a starting date for 
the program at the current meeting, most preferred to 
defer that decision until an upcoming meeting while ac-
cumulating additional information on the economic out-
look and developments potentially affecting financial 
markets. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in June indicated that the labor mar-
ket had continued to strengthen and that economic ac-
tivity had been rising moderately so far this year.  Job 
gains had been solid, on average, since the beginning of 
the year, and the unemployment rate had declined.  
Household spending and business fixed investment had 
continued to expand. 

On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure 
excluding food and energy prices had declined and were 
running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation remained low; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed on balance. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen 
somewhat further.  Inflation on a 12-month basis was 
expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the 
near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term.  Members saw the 
near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly bal-
anced, but, in light of their concern about the recent 
slowing in inflation, they agreed to continue to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent.  They noted that the 
stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor 

market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent in-
flation. 

Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
would depend on their assessment of realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  They expected that economic conditions would 
evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate 
was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are 
expected to prevail in the longer run.  They also again 
stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incom-
ing data.  In particular, they reaffirmed that they would 
carefully monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation 
goal.  Some members stressed the importance of under-
scoring the Committee’s commitment to its inflation ob-
jective.  These members emphasized that, in considering 
the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds 
rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to 
assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation 
were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajec-
tory consistent with achieving the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term. 

Members agreed that, at this meeting, the Committee 
should further clarify the time at which it expected to 
begin its program for reducing its securities holdings in 
a gradual and predictable manner.  They updated the 
postmeeting statement to indicate that while the Com-
mittee was, for the time being, maintaining its existing 
reinvestment policy, it intended to begin implementing 
the balance sheet normalization program relatively soon, 
provided that the economy evolved broadly as antici-
pated.  Several members observed that, in part because 
of the Committee’s various communications regarding 
the change, any reaction in financial markets to such a 
change would likely be limited. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective July 27, 2017, the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee directs the Desk to undertake 
open market operations as necessary to main-
tain the federal funds rate in a target range of 

Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2017 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

1 to 1¼ percent, including overnight reverse re-
purchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 1.00 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per- 
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in June indicates that 
the labor market has continued to strengthen 
and that economic activity has been rising mod-
erately so far this year.  Job gains have been 
solid, on average, since the beginning of the 
year, and the unemployment rate has declined.  
Household spending and business fixed invest-
ment have continued to expand.  On a 
12-month basis, overall inflation and the meas-
ure excluding food and energy prices have de-
clined and are running below 2 percent.   
Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion remain low; survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee continues to 
expect that, with gradual adjustments in the 
stance of monetary policy, economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace, and labor mar-
ket conditions will strengthen somewhat fur-
ther.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected 
to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near 
term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  

Near-term risks to the economic outlook ap-
pear roughly balanced, but the Committee is 
monitoring inflation developments closely. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a sustained re-
turn to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

For the time being, the Committee is maintain-
ing its existing policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The 
Committee expects to begin implementing its 
balance sheet normalization program relatively 
soon, provided that the economy evolves 
broadly as anticipated; this program is described 
in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee’s 
Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kash-
kari, and Jerome H. Powell. 

Voting against this action:  None.

changed at 1¼ percent and voted unanimously to ap-
prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount 
rate) at the existing level of 1¾ percent.4 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September  
19–20, 2017.  The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on 
July 26, 2017.
