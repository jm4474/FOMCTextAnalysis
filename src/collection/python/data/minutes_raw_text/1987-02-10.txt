Secretary's Note: The following actions were taken at the 
Wednesday session.  

1/ Attended portion of meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday related to 
consideration of the Committee's longer-run objectives for monetary 
and debt aggregates.



2/10-11/87

By unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1987 was 

approved by the Committee: 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster reasonable 
price stability over time, promote growth in output 
on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved 
pattern of international transactions. In furtherance 
of these objectives the Committee established growth 
ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, 
measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth 
quarter of 1987. The associated range for growth in 
total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 
percent for 1987.  

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, 
based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must 
be judged in the light of other evidence relating to 
economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have 
become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in 
interest rates, among other factors. During 1987, the 
Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow.  
However, in the light of its sensitivity to a variety 
of influences, the Committee decided not to establish 
a precise target for its growth over the year as a whole 
at this time. Instead, the appropriateness of changes 
in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in 
the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments 
in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of 
emerging price pressures.  

In that connection, the Committee believes that, 
particularly in the light of the extraordinary expansion 
of this aggregate in recent years, much slower monetary 
growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing 
economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying 
price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness 
of the dollar in exchange markets, and relatively strong 
growth in the broad monetary aggregates. Conversely, 
continuing sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated 
in circumstances characterized by sluggish business 
activity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price 
stability, and progress toward international equilibrium.  
As this implies, the Committee in reaching operational 
decisions during the year, might target appropriate growth 
in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then 
prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader 
aggregates.



2/10-11/87

With Mr. Melzer dissenting from the short-run operational paragraph, 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise 

directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 

accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
on balance that economic activity continues to grow at 
a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment grew 
sharply in January in part reflecting unusual seasonal 
developments. The civilian unemployment rate remained 
at 6.7 percent in January. Industrial production 
increased considerably in December and over the fourth 
quarter as a whole. Total retail sales rose sub
stantially in December, largely reflecting a year-end 
surge in automobile sales, but were little changed on 
balance in the fourth quarter. Housing starts also 
strengthened in December after trending lower since 
late spring. Business capital spending generally 
appears to have remained sluggish. Available data 
for the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the fourth 
quarter suggest a slight increase from the third 
quarter; however, after allowing for price changes, 
net exports of goods and services improved somewhat 
during the quarter. In late 1986 consumer and producer 
prices generally were continuing to rise at moderate 
rates, although prices of crude oil and some other 
industrial commodities firmed. Labor cost increases 
were more restrained in 1986 than in other recent 
years.  

Growth of M2 and M3 picked up substantially in 
December before slowing a little in January. For 1986 
as a whole, expansion of these two aggregates was near 
the upper end of their respective ranges established 
by the Committee for the year. Growth of M1 slowed in 
January from an exceptionally rapid pace in late 1986.  
Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained 
appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 
1986. Although short-term interest rates generally 
firmed around year-end, on balance interest rates have 
shown small mixed changes since the December 15-16 
meeting of the Committee; rates on Treasury securities, 
including bonds, have risen a little over the period 
while rates on most private obligations have declined 
slightly. In foreign exchange markets the trade-weighted 
value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies 
has declined substantially on balance since the December 
meeting.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster reasonable 
price stability over time, promote growth in output 
on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved 
pattern of international transactions. In furtherance 
of these objectives the Committee established growth 
ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, 
measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth 
quarter of 1987. The associated range for growth in 
total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 
percent for 1987.  

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, 
based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must 
be judged in the light of other evidence relating to 
economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have 
become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in 
interest rates, among other factors. During 1987, the 
Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow.  
However, in the light of its sensitivity to a variety 
of influences, the Committee decided not to establish 
a precise target for its growth over the year as a whole 
at this time. Instead, the appropriateness of changes 
in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in 
the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments 
in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of 
emerging price pressures.  

In that connection, the Committee believes that, 
particularly in the light of the extraordinary expansion 
of this aggregate in recent years, much slower monetary 
growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing 
economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying 
price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness

decisions during the year, might target appropriate growth 
in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then 
prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader 
aggregates.



2/10-11/87

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action 
is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 
over the period from January through March at annual 
rates of about 6 to 7 percent. Growth in M1 is ex
pected to slow substantially from the high rate of 
earlier months. Somewhat greater reserve restraint 
would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be 
acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, 
taking into account the strength of the business 
expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, 
progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic 
and international credit markets. The Chairman may 
call for Committee consultation if it appears to the 
Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions 
during the period before the next meeting are likely 
to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently 
outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on March 31, 1987.  

The meeting adjourned.
