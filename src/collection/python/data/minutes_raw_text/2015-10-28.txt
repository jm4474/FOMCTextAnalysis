rates. 
 
 
Equilibrium Real Interest Rates 
The staff presented several briefings regarding the con-
cept of an equilibrium real interest rate—sometimes la-
beled the “neutral” or “natural” real interest rate, or 
“r*”—that can serve as a benchmark to help gauge the 
stance of monetary policy.  Various concepts of r* were 
discussed.  According to one definition, short-run r* is 
the level of the real short-term interest rate that, if ob-
tained currently, would result in the economy operating 
at full employment or, in some simple models of the 
economy, at full employment and price stability.  The 
staff summarized the behavior of estimates of the short-
run equilibrium real rate over recent business cycles as 
well as longer-run trends in real interest rates and key 
factors that influence those trends.  Estimates derived 
using a variety of empirical models of the U.S. economy 
and a range of econometric techniques indicated that 
short-run r* fell sharply with the onset of the 2008–09 
financial crisis and recession, quite likely to negative lev-
els.  Short-run r* was estimated to have recovered only 
partially and to be close to zero currently, still well below 
levels that prevailed during recent economic expansions 
when the unemployment rate was close to estimates of 
its longer-run normal level. 

With respect to longer-run trends, the staff noted that 
multiyear averages of short-term real interest rates had 
been declining not only in the United States, but also in 
many other large economies for the past quarter-century 
and stood near zero in most of those economies.  More-
over, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium 
level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain 
low relative to estimates of its level before the financial 
crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does 
not pick up and if demographic projections for slow 
growth in working-age populations are borne out.  Fi-
nally, the staff discussed the implications of uncertainty

about the level of the equilibrium real rate for using es-
timates of short-run r* as a guideline for appropriate 
monetary policy. 

In their comments on the briefings and in their discus-
sion of the potential use of r* in monetary policy delib-
erations, policymakers made a number of observations.  
The unemployment rate has declined gradually in recent 
years, indicating that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth has, on average, exceeded growth of potential 
GDP, but not by a substantial margin.  This outcome, in 
turn, suggested that the actual level of short-term real 
interest rates has been below but not substantially below 
the equilibrium real rate, consistent with estimates that 
r* currently is close to zero, notably below its historical 
average. 

A number of participants indicated that they expected 
short-run r* to rise as the economic expansion contin-
ued, but probably only gradually.  Moreover, it was 
noted that the longer-run downward trend in real inter-
est rates suggested that short-run r* would likely remain 
below levels that were normal during previous business 
cycle expansions, and that the longer-run normal level to 
which the nominal federal funds rate might be expected 
to converge in the absence of further shocks to the econ-
omy—that is, the level that would be consistent, in the 
long run, with maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation—would likely be lower than was the case in pre-
vious decades.  A lower long-run level of r* would also 
imply that the gap between the actual level of the federal 
funds rate and its near-zero effective lower bound would 
be smaller on average.  A smaller gap might increase the 
frequency of episodes in which policymakers would not 
be able to reduce the federal funds rate enough to pro-
mote a strong economic recovery and rapid return to 
maximum employment or to maintain price stability in 
the aftermath of negative shocks to aggregate demand.  
Some participants noted that it would be prudent to have 
additional policy tools that could be used in such situa-
tions. 

Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market 
Operations, and Policy Normalization 
The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac-
count (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic 
and foreign financial markets, money markets, and Sys-
tem open market operations conducted by the Open 
Market Desk during the period since the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC) met on September 16–17.  
Take-up of the System’s overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations increased during this period, evi-
dently reflecting a modest narrowing of the spread of 

money market interest rates over the offered rate on 
such operations.  Total take-up of overnight and term 
reverse repurchase agreements at the end of the third 
quarter was also elevated.  The deputy manager briefed 
the Committee on plans for the upcoming quarterly test 
of the Term Deposit Facility in December and for term 
reverse repurchase agreement operations to be con-
ducted ahead of year-end.  In addition, an update was 
provided on a data collection that will allow the calcula-
tion of the federal funds effective rate and a new over-
night bank funding rate based on transaction-level data 
reported by depository institutions that are active in 
overnight bank funding markets; as previously reported, 
the Federal Reserve expects to begin publication of the 
rates based on these data in the first few months of 2016.  

A staff presentation reviewed issues that could arise if 
the Treasury was temporarily unable to meet its obliga-
tions because of constraints associated with the statutory 
federal debt limit.  Following the presentation, policy-
makers indicated that, if such issues arose, it remained 
appropriate to follow the strategy for open market oper-
ations, the discount window, and other System respon-
sibilities that was discussed at the Committee’s video-
conference meeting of October 16, 2013, and summa-
rized in the minutes of that meeting. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account over the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the October 27–28 meet-
ing suggested that real GDP was increasing at a moder-
ate pace, but that the improvement in labor market con-
ditions had slowed somewhat in recent months.  Infla-
tion continued to run below the FOMC’s longer-run ob-
jective of 2 percent, restrained in part by declines in en-
ergy prices and prices of non-energy imported goods.  
Survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations re-
mained stable; market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation moved slightly lower. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at about 
the same rate in September as in August, although at a 
slower pace than earlier this year, and the unemployment 
rate remained at 5.1 percent.  Both the labor force par-
ticipation rate and the employment-to-population ratio 
edged down.  However, the share of workers employed 
part time for economic reasons fell a little.  The rate of 
private-sector job openings declined in August but was

still at a high level, while the rates of hiring and quits 
were unchanged. 

Industrial production decreased in September as the out-
put of both the manufacturing and mining sectors de-
clined, likely reflecting the effects of the appreciation in 
the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the fall in 
crude oil prices since the middle of last year.  Automak-
ers’ assembly schedules, as well as broader indicators of 
manufacturing production, such as the readings on new 
orders from national and regional manufacturing sur-
veys, generally pointed to further decreases in factory 
output in coming months.  Recent information on crude 
oil and natural gas extraction indicated further declines 
in mining output. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to rise at a solid rate in the third quarter as a 
whole.  The components of the nominal retail sales data 
used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct 
its estimate of PCE increased only slightly in September, 
but the rate of sales of light motor vehicles rose to a new 
high for the year.  Real disposable income grew at a solid 
pace in July and August.  Households’ net worth was 
boosted by recent gains in home values and the net in-
crease in equity prices over the intermeeting period.  
Moreover, consumer sentiment in the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved in early Oc-
tober.   

Activity in the housing sector was mixed, but it generally 
continued to recover slowly.  Starts of new single-family 
homes stepped down modestly, on net, over August and 
September, although building permits increased slightly.  
Meanwhile, starts of multifamily units rose notably.  
Sales of new and existing homes moved down somewhat 
on balance. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property products appeared to increase at a 
solid pace in the third quarter.  Nominal shipments of 
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in Sep-
tember.  However, forward-looking indicators, such as 
new orders for these capital goods along with national 
and regional surveys of business conditions, pointed to 
more modest increases in business equipment spending 
in the coming months.  Firms’ nominal spending for 
nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining 
rose in August, although available indicators of drilling 
activity, such as the number of oil and gas rigs in opera-
tion, continued to fall.  Real private inventory invest-
ment appeared to have slowed markedly in the third 
quarter. 

Total real government purchases looked to have moved 
sideways in the third quarter.  Federal government pur-
chases likely declined a little, as defense spending 
stepped down further.  In contrast, state and local gov-
ernment purchases appeared to have been rising; the 
payrolls of these governments expanded further in Sep-
tember, and their nominal construction spending in July 
and August was above its level in the second quarter. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in August as 
exports declined and imports rose.  The fall in exports 
was concentrated in industrial supplies, while consumer 
and capital goods accounted for much of the growth in 
imports.  Advance estimates for September indicated a 
narrower merchandise trade deficit, with a rebound in 
exports and a decline in imports relative to August.  Af-
ter falling sharply early this year, real net exports were 
little changed in the second quarter and appeared to have 
stayed flat in the third quarter, with real exports remain-
ing soft. 

Total U.S. consumer prices in August, as measured by 
the PCE price index, were unchanged from 12 months 
earlier, reflecting large declines in consumer energy 
prices.  Core PCE inflation, which excludes changes in 
food and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same 
12-month period, restrained in part by declines in the 
prices of non-energy goods imports.  In September, total 
consumer prices as measured by the consumer price in-
dex (CPI) were unchanged from a year earlier, while the 
core CPI increased almost 2 percent.  Measures of ex-
pected longer-run inflation from a number of surveys, 
including the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic 
Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, 
remained stable.  However, market-based measures of 
inflation compensation moved a little lower.  Average 
hourly earnings for all employees increased 2¼ percent 
over the 12 months ending in September, a pace that was 
faster than consumer price inflation. 

Foreign economic growth appeared to have improved 
somewhat in the third quarter following two quarters of 
slow growth.  Economic activity rebounded in Canada 
after disruptions to energy production earlier in the year, 
and real GDP growth jumped to 5 percent in South Ko-
rea as the effects of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome) outbreak faded.  Chinese real GDP growth 
remained around 7 percent on a four-quarter change ba-
sis, and information on economic activity in the euro 
area and the United Kingdom was consistent with con-
tinued expansion.  However, indicators of economic ac-
tivity in Japan and Brazil remained weak.  Headline in-
flation was low in many countries as a result of falling

energy prices.  Inflation rates remained high in some 
South American countries whose currencies had recently 
depreciated sharply. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Continued concerns about the global economic growth 
outlook weighed on market sentiment in the United 
States and abroad early in the intermeeting period, but 
sentiment improved somewhat in the weeks preceding 
the October FOMC meeting.  Following the weaker-
than-expected report on the U.S. employment situation 
in September, market participants’ expectations for the 
timing of the initial increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate shifted out, and their expectation for 
the subsequent path of the federal funds rate flattened.  
Financing conditions for most businesses and house-
holds remained accommodative but tightened somewhat 
for businesses with lower credit quality. 

Federal Reserve communications and economic data re-
leases over the intermeeting period appeared to have led 
investors to expect a later start date for monetary policy 
normalization and a more gradual path for the federal 
funds rate thereafter.  According to federal funds futures 
quotes just before the October FOMC meeting, as well 
as results from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and 
Survey of Market Participants, market participants saw a 
significantly lower chance of the initial increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate occurring before 
year-end than they perceived just before the September 
meeting, while the likelihood of liftoff occurring at or 
after the March 2016 meeting rose.  The expected path 
for the federal funds rate implied by quotes on overnight 
index swap rates flattened notably over the intermeeting 
period. 

Nominal Treasury yields declined further, reflecting 
FOMC communications, concerns about global eco-
nomic growth, and generally weaker-than-expected U.S. 
economic data releases.  Measures of inflation compen-
sation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities 
moved slightly lower on net. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes fell in the first few weeks 
after the September FOMC meeting but subsequently 
more than retraced those declines.  Spreads of yields on 
triple-B-rated corporate bonds over comparable- 
maturity Treasury securities changed little, on balance, 
and those on speculative-grade corporate bonds wid-
ened notably across sectors.  Across the credit spectrum, 
spreads were generally near their highest levels in several 
years and ended the period above their historical medi-
ans.  Based on available reports and analysts’ estimates, 

aggregate corporate earnings per share in the third quar-
ter were expected to decrease slightly, with large declines 
in the energy and materials sectors.  Spreads on lever-
aged loans increased in August and moved up, on bal-
ance, over the intermeeting period. 

Overall, financing conditions for nonfinancial busi-
nesses were generally accommodative but tightened 
somewhat for lower-rated firms.  Corporate bond issu-
ance rebounded in September after a slowdown in Au-
gust.  The expansion of commercial and industrial loans 
on banks’ books moderated slightly during the third 
quarter, and lending standards were little changed, on 
net, after several years of easing, according to the Octo-
ber Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lend-
ing Practices (SLOOS).  Financing conditions for small 
businesses continued to improve, with loan originations 
maintaining their upward trend, although indicators of 
the optimism of small business owners declined in re-
cent months.  Financing conditions for municipalities re-
mained accommodative on balance.  Even though news 
reports on Puerto Rico’s public-sector debt situation 
garnered attention of market participants, credit default 
swap spreads on Puerto Rico’s general obligation debt 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  

Spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) widened over the intermeeting period, while re-
spondents in the SLOOS reported that standards on 
commercial real estate (CRE) loans were little changed 
in the third quarter.  Overall, CRE financing appeared to 
remain broadly available.  All major categories of CRE 
loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded robustly 
through September, consistent with reports of stronger 
demand for such loans in the SLOOS. 

Credit conditions for residential mortgages eased mod-
estly, on net, in the third quarter.  A moderate net frac-
tion of SLOOS respondents continued to ease standards 
on loans eligible for purchase by the government- 
sponsored enterprises and on jumbo loans, but stan-
dards on government-backed loans tightened somewhat.  
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined 
over the intermeeting period.  

Conditions in consumer credit markets remained ac-
commodative on balance.  Outstanding credit card bal-
ances expanded further in August, and a moderate net 
fraction of banks in the SLOOS indicated that they eased 
standards on such loans during the third quarter.  How-
ever, credit card limits remained mostly flat overall and 
were fairly tight for subprime borrowers.  The growth of 
auto and student loans stayed robust.

Continued concerns about the outlook for global eco-
nomic growth weighed on commodity and foreign eq-
uity prices early in the intermeeting period.  These de-
clines subsequently were reversed, and foreign equity 
price indexes ended the period higher, pushed up by ex-
pectations of additional monetary policy accommoda-
tion in major foreign economies and some favorable 
economic indicators in China. 

The broad nominal index of the dollar’s foreign ex-
change value ended the period little changed on balance.  
The dollar depreciated early in the period following the 
weaker-than-expected U.S. employment report for Sep-
tember and the subsequent downward shift of the ex-
pected path for U.S. policy rates.  But this decline was 
balanced by subsequent appreciation, in part as expecta-
tions increased for greater monetary policy accommoda-
tion abroad.  These shifting expectations also contrib-
uted to a decline in sovereign yields in the advanced for-
eign economies.   

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability.  Since the previous report in July, fi-
nancial markets around the globe experienced a surge in 
volatility that peaked in late August amid concerns re-
garding slowing economic growth in emerging market 
economies and potential implications for advanced 
economies.  This volatility was accompanied by sizable 
declines in the prices of some risky assets, and an in-
crease in risk aversion eased valuation pressures in the 
corporate bond market.  Issuance of speculative-grade 
corporate bonds and leveraged loans slowed from the 
rapid pace seen earlier this year.  The U.S. financial sys-
tem appeared to absorb the shocks without systemic 
strains, supported by relatively high capital positions of 
large banking organizations and insurance firms and by 
restrained use of short-term wholesale funding across 
the financial sector.  Moreover, leverage in the nonfinan-
cial sector remained modest overall.  However, leverage 
of speculative-grade and unrated nonfinancial corpora-
tions stayed near record levels.  Rising CRE prices, ac-
companied by loosening underwriting standards in 
CMBS markets, continued to suggest valuation pres-
sures. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
October FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the sec-
ond half of this year was a little lower, on balance, than 
in the projection for the September meeting, largely re-
flecting a downward revision to estimated inventory in-
vestment.  The staff’s medium-term projection for real 

GDP growth was essentially unrevised from the previ-
ous forecast.  The staff continued to project that real 
GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than po-
tential output from 2016 through 2018, supported pri-
marily by increases in consumer spending.  The unem-
ployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to 
run a little below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run 
natural rate over this period. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was re-
vised up a little, reflecting recent data, and it was unre-
vised over the medium term.  Energy prices and prices 
of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin 
steadily rising next year.  The staff projected that infla-
tion would increase gradually over the next several years 
but would still be slightly below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018.  However, 
inflation was anticipated to reach 2 percent thereafter, 
with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to 
be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack 
in labor and product markets projected to have waned. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its October pro-
jections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation as similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP and 
inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting 
the staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal 
policy was well positioned to help the economy with-
stand substantial adverse shocks.  Consistent with this 
downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the 
risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted 
to the upside.  

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants saw the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as suggesting that 
economic activity had been expanding moderately.  
Household spending and business fixed investment in-
creased at solid rates in recent months, and the housing 
sector improved further.  However, net exports re-
mained soft.  Participants noted that the pace of job 
gains slowed while the unemployment rate held steady; 
nonetheless, a range of labor market indicators, on bal-
ance, suggested that underutilization of labor resources 
had diminished since early this year.  With private do-
mestic final demand expanding at a solid pace, partici-
pants generally viewed the incoming data as confirming 
their assessment that economic activity would continue 
to expand at a moderate rate, leading to further improve-

ment in labor market conditions.  However, some par-
ticipants were concerned that the recent slowdown in 
employment growth might prove more than temporary, 
and that improvement in labor market conditions might 
not continue.  Most participants saw the downside risks 
arising from economic and financial developments 
abroad as having diminished and judged the risks to the 
outlook for domestic economic activity and the labor 
market to be nearly balanced.  A few participants, 
though, noted that downside risks from abroad were still 
significant.  Inflation continued to run below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting 
declines in energy prices and prices of non-energy im-
ports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion moved slightly lower; survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  Par-
ticipants generally anticipated that inflation would rise 
gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improved 
further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in 
energy and import prices dissipated. 

Notwithstanding the disappointing retail sales data in 
September, participants were encouraged by the solid 
pace of consumption growth in the third quarter and 
generally expected consumer spending to rise moder-
ately going forward.  Gains in employment and income, 
low gasoline prices, and a high level of consumer confi-
dence were viewed as factors that should support con-
sumer spending.  The available reports from District 
contacts in the retail and auto industries indicated solid 
gains in consumer spending, and contacts were optimis-
tic about the near-term outlook. 

Participants generally viewed the housing sector as con-
tinuing to recover, although a couple of participants 
noted that the pace of recovery was slow.  Contacts in a 
number of Districts were upbeat about the sector, citing 
rising home prices and a healthy pace of construction 
and sales. 

Participants noted that business fixed investment ap-
peared to be increasing at a solid rate despite the sharp 
contraction in energy-related investment.  Nonresiden-
tial construction was reported to be expanding in a num-
ber of regions.  A large decline in inventory investment 
was expected to reduce the pace of GDP growth in the 
third quarter, but participants saw further outsized de-
clines in inventory accumulation as unlikely.  Partici-
pants expected net exports to continue to subtract from 
GDP growth in the second half of the year, reflecting 
weak foreign activity as well as the earlier appreciation 
of the dollar.  However, solid underlying momentum in 

private domestic demand was anticipated to support 
economic growth going forward. 

Manufacturing activity had slowed somewhat over the 
intermeeting period in a number of regions, importantly 
reflecting the weakness in exports, although the auto in-
dustry remained a bright spot.  Weakness in commodity 
prices also continued to weigh on activity in the energy 
and agricultural sectors.  Moreover, industry contacts re-
mained pessimistic about the outlook for the energy sec-
tor.  The substantial global supply of crude oil seemed 
likely to weigh on energy prices for some time, contrib-
uting to an increase in restructurings and bankruptcies in 
this sector. In contrast, service-sector reports were 
mostly positive. 

Although employment growth slowed and the unem-
ployment rate held steady in September, participants 
agreed that underutilization of labor resources had been 
reduced since earlier in the year.  A number of partici-
pants expressed the view that further progress would be 
necessary before labor market conditions were fully con-
sistent with maximum employment, while some others 
judged that there was little or no remaining underutiliza-
tion of labor resources.  Several participants observed 
that the recent employment reports had increased the 
uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market.  
They discussed whether the slowdown in job gains was 
merely transitory or indicative of a more persistent slow-
down in which labor market conditions might no longer 
improve.  Some other indicators, such as the labor force 
participation rate and data on job openings, quits, and 
hiring, had also been softer.  Other participants viewed 
a broad range of recent labor market data as indicating a 
further reduction in slack and stressed the importance of 
assessing the cumulative improvement in the labor mar-
ket since early in the year, which had been significant.  
Moreover, several participants indicated that they 
viewed the pace of monthly job gains in September as 
still above the rate consistent with stable or declining la-
bor market slack, and a few participants interpreted 
slower increases in payrolls as evidence that labor mar-
kets had tightened. 

The incoming information on wages and labor compen-
sation, including recent data on average hourly earnings 
of employees, suggested that the pace of wage gains re-
mained subdued.  A number of participants cited staff 
analysis indicating that the modest pace of labor com-
pensation growth in recent years may have reflected 
slower trend productivity growth that offset the upward 
pressure on wages from the narrowing of labor market

slack.  However, other participants noted that the con-
tinued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an ab-
sence of upward pressure on inflation from the current 
level of resource utilization.  A number of participants 
reported that some of their business contacts were expe-
riencing increasing challenges in hiring, resulting in up-
ward pressure on wages in various occupations and in 
some geographic areas. 

Participants discussed how recent economic develop-
ments influenced their expectations for reaching the 
FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective over the medium 
term.  Total PCE price inflation, as measured on a  
12-month basis, continued to run below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective.  Core PCE inflation also re-
mained low, but some other measures of inflation, such 
as the trimmed mean PCE and trimmed mean CPI 
measures, continued to run at higher levels than core 
PCE inflation and had recently moved up modestly.  
Moreover, a few participants noted that the September 
CPI data appeared consistent with some firming in infla-
tion.  Surveys continued to suggest that longer-run infla-
tion expectations remained stable.  Participants still ex-
pected that the downward pressure on inflation from the 
previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past 
dollar appreciation would prove temporary.  Several par-
ticipants, however, cited downside risks to inflation, 
pointing, for example, to declines in market-based 
measures of inflation compensation.  Nonetheless, par-
ticipants generally continued to anticipate that, with ap-
propriate monetary policy, inflation would move toward 
the Committee’s objective over the medium term, re-
flecting the anticipated tightening of product and labor 
markets, the waning of downward pressures from energy 
and import prices, and stable inflation expectations. 

Participants also discussed a range of topics related to 
financial market developments and financial stability.  
They noted that volatility in global financial markets had 
abated since the previous FOMC meeting, with equity 
prices in the United States largely retracing the declines 
experienced late in the summer.  The U.S. financial sys-
tem appeared to have weathered the turbulence in global 
financial markets without any sign of systemic stress.  
Participants commented on issues related to financial 
stability monitoring and the use of macroprudential 
tools, the assessment of valuation risks in leveraged loan 
and real estate markets, the widening of credit spreads 
on corporate bonds, and potential risks to financial sta-
bility stemming from interest rates remaining low for a 
prolonged period in an environment of a low neutral (or 
equilibrium) real rate.  In addition, it was noted that 

Puerto Rico continued to face significant challenges ser-
vicing its debts, although the associated systemic risks 
for U.S. financial markets were likely to be minimal.    

During their discussion of economic conditions and 
monetary policy, participants focused on a number of 
issues associated with the timing and pace of policy nor-
malization.  Some participants thought that the condi-
tions for beginning the policy normalization process had 
already been met.  Most participants anticipated that, 
based on their assessment of the current economic situ-
ation and their outlook for economic activity, the labor 
market, and inflation, these conditions could well be met 
by the time of the next meeting.  Nonetheless, they em-
phasized that the actual decision would depend on the 
implications for the medium-term economic outlook of 
the data received over the upcoming intermeeting pe-
riod.  Some others, however, judged it unlikely that the 
information available by the December meeting would 
warrant raising the target range for the federal funds rate 
at that meeting.   

A number of participants pointed to various reasons 
why the Committee should avoid a delay in policy firm-
ing.  One concern was that such a delay, if the reasons 
were not well understood by market participants, could 
increase uncertainty in financial markets and unduly 
magnify the perceived importance of the beginning of 
the policy normalization process.  Another concern 
mentioned was the increasing risk of a buildup of finan-
cial imbalances after a prolonged period of very low in-
terest rates.  It was also noted that a decision to defer 
policy firming could be interpreted as signaling lack of 
confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy or erode 
the Committee’s credibility.  Some participants empha-
sized that progress toward the Committee’s objectives 
should be assessed in light of the cumulative gains made 
to date without placing excessive weight on month-to-
month changes in incoming data. 

Several participants indicated that, despite lessening con-
cerns about the implications of recent global economic 
and financial developments for domestic economic ac-
tivity and inflation, appreciable downside risks to the 
outlook remained.  They were concerned about a poten-
tial loss of momentum in the economy and the associ-
ated possibility that inflation might fail to increase as ex-
pected.  Such concerns might suggest that the initiation 
of the normalization process may not yet be warranted.  
They also noted uncertainty about whether economic 
growth was robust enough to withstand potential ad-
verse shocks, given the limited ability of monetary policy 
to offset such shocks when the federal funds rate is near 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

its effective lower bound, and concern that the begin-
ning of policy normalization might be associated with an 
unwarranted tightening of financial conditions.  They 
believed that in these circumstances, risk-management 
considerations called for a cautious approach.  They 
judged it appropriate to wait for additional information 
providing evidence of further improvement in the labor 
market and increasing their confidence that inflation was 
on a path to return to 2 percent over the medium term 
before raising the target range for the federal funds rate.  
In addition, a couple of participants cited concerns that 
a premature tightening might damage the credibility of 
the Committee’s inflation objective if inflation stayed be-
low 2 percent for a prolonged period.   

Several participants indicated that, in the current low in-
terest rate environment, it would be prudent for the 
Committee to consider options for providing additional 
monetary policy accommodation if the outlook for eco-
nomic activity were to weaken to a degree that seemed 
likely to undermine continued progress in labor market 
conditions and impede the movement of inflation back 
to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  It was also noted that the Committee would need 
to reformulate its communications regarding the near-
term outlook for monetary policy if the economic out-
look weakened significantly.  

During their discussion of the likely path for the federal 
funds rate after the time of the first increase in the target 
range, participants generally agreed that it would proba-
bly be appropriate to remove policy accommodation 
gradually.  Participants also indicated that the expected 
path of policy, rather than the timing of the initial in-
crease, would be the more important influence on finan-
cial conditions and thus on the outlook for the economy 
and inflation, and they noted the importance of under-
scoring this view at the time of liftoff.  It was noted that 
beginning the normalization process relatively soon 
would make it more likely that the policy trajectory after 
liftoff could be shallow.  It was also emphasized that, 
while participants’ most recent economic projections 
suggested that a gradual increase in the target range for 
the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate to sup-
port progress toward the Committee’s dual objectives, 
monetary policy adjustments ultimately would be de-
pendent on economic and financial developments.  
These adjustments thus could be either more or less 
gradual than the Committee currently anticipates, re-
sponding to the Committee’s assessment of the implica-
tions of incoming information for the medium-run out-
look. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in September indicated that economic 
activity had been expanding at a moderate pace.  Al-
though net exports had been soft and inventory accu-
mulation appeared to have slowed, major domestic com-
ponents of spending were increasing at solid rates.  With 
concerns about global economic and financial develop-
ments having lessened, members continued to see the 
risks to the outlook for economic activity as nearly bal-
anced, although they were still monitoring these devel-
opments.  Members indicated that they expected that, 
with appropriate policy accommodation, economic ac-
tivity would continue to expand at a moderate pace.   

Almost all members agreed that, even though the pace 
of job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had 
held steady over the intermeeting period, labor market 
indicators, on balance, showed that underutilization of 
labor resources had diminished since early in the year.  
Members anticipated that economic activity was likely to 
expand at a pace sufficient for labor market indicators to 
continue to move toward, or to remain at, levels the 
Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate.  In-
flation continued to run below the Committee’s longer-
run objective, held down in part by the effects of de-
clines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-
ports.  Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations had remained stable; market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had moved slightly 
lower.  While inflation was anticipated to remain near its 
recent low level in the near term, reflecting the transitory 
effects of declines in energy and import prices, members 
continued to expect inflation to rise gradually toward 2 
percent over the medium term as the labor market im-
proved further and such transitory effects dissipated.  
Nonetheless, they agreed to continue monitoring infla-
tion developments closely. 

In assessing whether economic conditions and the  
medium-term economic outlook warranted beginning 
the process of policy normalization at this meeting, 
members noted a variety of indicators, including some 
weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor 
market conditions, and almost all members agreed it was 
appropriate to wait for additional information to clarify 
whether the recent deceleration in the pace of progress 
in the labor market was transitory or reflected more per-
sistent factors that might jeopardize further progress.  
They indicated that they would be assessing a range of 
labor market indicators over the period ahead to confirm 
further improvement in the labor market.  Members,

however, expressed a range of views regarding the extent 
of further progress in labor market indicators they would 
need to see to judge it appropriate to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate in December.    

Members continued to anticipate that inflation would 
gradually return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term, but most of them were not yet 
sufficiently confident of that outlook to begin the nor-
malization process.  They generally agreed that their con-
fidence would increase if, as anticipated, economic activ-
ity continued to expand at a pace sufficient to increase 
resource utilization.  Other factors important to the in-
flation outlook were the expectation that the influence 
of lower energy and commodities prices and the stronger 
dollar would subside, and that longer-term inflation ex-
pectations would remain stable.  In this regard, a couple 
of members expressed concern about the continued de-
cline in market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion.  Moreover, the risk was noted that downward pres-
sures on inflation from the appreciation of the dollar 
could persist. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties 
associated with the outlook, all but one member agreed 
to leave the target range for the federal funds rate un-
changed at this meeting.  Members generally agreed that, 
in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on 
measures of labor market conditions and in the absence 
of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it 
would be prudent to wait for additional information 
bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating 
the process of policy normalization.  One member, how-
ever, preferred to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. 

In its postmeeting statement, rather than framing its 
near-term policy path in terms of how long to maintain 
the current target range, the Committee decided to indi-
cate that, in determining whether it would be appropri-
ate to raise the target range at its next meeting, it would 
assess both realized and expected progress toward its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  Members emphasized that this change was in-
tended to convey the sense that, while no decision had 
been made, it may well become appropriate to initiate 
the normalization process at the next meeting, provided 
that unanticipated shocks do not adversely affect the 
economic outlook and that incoming data support the 
expectation that labor market conditions will continue to 
improve and that inflation will return to the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  Members 

saw the updated language as leaving policy options open 
for the next meeting.  However, a couple of members 
expressed concern that this wording change could be 
misinterpreted as signaling too strongly the expectation 
that the target range for the federal funds rate would be 
increased at the Committee’s next meeting.  While mem-
bers differed in their assessment of the likelihood that 
incoming information will warrant an increase in the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate when the Committee 
meets in December, they agreed that, in making the de-
cision, the Committee will evaluate progress toward its 
objectives, taking into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  It was noted that the expected path of the fed-
eral funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial 
increase, was most important in influencing financial 
conditions and thus in affecting the outlook for the 
economy and inflation.  The Committee reiterated its ex-
pectation that, even after employment and inflation are 
near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal 
funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal 
in the longer run. 

The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-
ties at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s 
holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, 
should help maintain accommodative financial condi-
tions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 
¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain such conditions.  The Committee 
directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling 
over maturing Treasury securities into new 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

issues and its policy of reinvesting principal 
payments on all agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-
backed securities.  The Committee also directs 
the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon 
swap transactions as necessary to facilitate 
settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The 
System Open Market Account manager and the 
secretary will keep the Committee informed of 
ongoing developments regarding the System’s 
balance sheet that could affect the attainment 
over time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in September suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding at a 
moderate pace.  Household spending and busi-
ness fixed investment have been increasing at 
solid rates in recent months, and the housing 
sector has improved further; however, net ex-
ports have been soft.  The pace of job gains 
slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.  
Nonetheless, labor market indicators, on bal-
ance, show that underutilization of labor re-
sources has diminished since early this year.  In-
flation has continued to run below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective, partly reflecting de-
clines in energy prices and in prices of non- 
energy imports.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation moved slightly lower;  
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable.  

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 
with appropriate policy accommodation, eco-
nomic activity will expand at a moderate pace, 
with labor market indicators continuing to 
move toward levels the Committee judges con-
sistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee 
continues to see the risks to the outlook for eco-
nomic activity and the labor market as nearly 
balanced but is monitoring global economic and 
financial developments.  Inflation is anticipated 
to remain near its recent low level in the near 
term but the Committee expects inflation to rise 
gradually toward 2 percent over the medium 

term as the labor market improves further and 
the transitory effects of declines in energy and 
import prices dissipate.  The Committee contin-
ues to monitor inflation developments closely.  

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the Com-
mittee today reaffirmed its view that the current 
0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate remains appropriate.  In determining 
whether it will be appropriate to raise the target 
range at its next meeting, the Committee will as-
sess progress—both realized and expected—to-
ward its objectives of maximum employment 
and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will 
take into account a wide range of information, 
including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readings on financial and in-
ternational developments.  The Committee an-
ticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate when it 
has seen some further improvement in the labor 
market and is reasonably confident that infla-
tion will move back to its 2 percent objective 
over the medium term.  

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the 
Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accom-
modative financial conditions.  

When the Committee decides to begin to re-
move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-
anced approach consistent with its longer-run 
goals of maximum employment and inflation of 
2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates 
that, even after employment and inflation are 
near mandate-consistent levels, economic con-
ditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the 
target federal funds rate below levels the Com-
mittee views as normal in the longer run.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley Fischer, 
Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome H. Powell, Daniel K. Ta-
rullo, and John C. Williams. 

Voting against this action:  Jeffrey M. Lacker. 

Minutes of the Meeting of October 27–28, 2015 Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

Mr. Lacker dissented because he continued to believe 
that maintaining exceptionally low real interest rates was 
not appropriate for an economy with persistently strong 
consumption growth and tightening labor markets.  
Data received since the September FOMC meeting 
suggested that the global economic and financial 
developments of late summer had little effect on the 
medium-term outlook for U.S. growth and inflation.  He 
remained reasonably confident that inflation would 
return to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal once 
temporary disinflationary impulses had passed. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 15–

16, 2015.  The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m. on 
October 28, 2015. 

Notation Vote 

By notation vote completed on October 7, 2015, the
