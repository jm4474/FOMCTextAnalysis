With Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 

execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 

domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
that the expansion in economic activity has moderated 
from the vigorous pace earlier in the year. Total 
nonfarm payroll employment grew considerably in the 
third quarter but the gains were less than those 
registered in the first half of the year and employment 
in manufacturing declined in August and September. The 
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in 
September, remaining in the narrow range that has 
prevailed since early spring. Industrial production 
advanced only slightly on balance in August and 
September after a sharp increase in July, while housing 
construction has been flat in recent months. Consumer 
spending increased substantially on average in the third 
quarter but apparently slowed in recent months. Indica
tors of business capital spending suggest considerably 
slower expansion in the third quarter, following very 
rapid growth in the first half of the year. Preliminary 
data for the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in 
August showed a greater deficit than in July, but the 
average for July-August was slightly less than the 
second-quarter rate. The latest information on prices 
and wages suggests little if any change from recent 
trends.  

Interest rates in long-term debt markets have 
declined a little further since the Committee meeting on 
September 20, while rates in short-term markets have 
edged higher. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value 
of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies 
declined appreciably over the intermeeting period from 
the high level of last summer.  

Expansion of M2 has slowed considerably in recent 
months; growth of M3 moderated in August and September 
but appears to have strengthened somewhat in October.  
Thus far this year, M2 has grown at a rate somewhat 
below, and M3 at a rate somewhat above, the midpoint of 
the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 
has increased only slightly on balance in recent months 
after registering relatively strong growth in June and 
July. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt for 
the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below 
that in 1987.



-5-

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster price 
stability over time, promote growth in output on a 
sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern 
of international transactions. In furtherance of these 
objectives, the Committee at its meeting in late June 
reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for 
growth of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured 
from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 
1988. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
nonfinancial debt was also maintained at 7 to 11 percent 
for the year.  

For 1989, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges 
for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 
1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989, of 3 to 7 percent 
for M2 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee 
set the associated monitoring range for growth of total 
domestic nonfinancial debt at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  
It was understood that all these ranges were provisional 
and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the 
light of intervening developments.  

With respect to M1, the Committee reaffirmed its 
decision in February not to establish a specific target 
for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range 
for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate will continue 
to be evaluated in the light of movements in its 
velocity, developments in the economy and financial 
markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account 
of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength 
of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary 
aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and 
domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve 
restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from 
September through December at annual rates of about 
2-1/2 and 6 percent, respectively. The Chairman may 
call for Committee consultation if it appears to the 
Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions 
during the period before the next meeting are likely to 
be associated with a federal funds rate persistently 
outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on 

Wednesday, December 14, 1988.  

The meeting adjourned.
