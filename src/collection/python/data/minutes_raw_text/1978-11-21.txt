11/21/78

The information reviewed at this meeting 
suggests that in the current quarter real out
put of goods and services is continuing to grow 
moderately. In October industrial production 
expanded further, nonfarm payroll employment 
rose considerably, and the unemployment rate 
declined from 6.0 to 5.8 per cent. Following 
2 months of gains, the dollar value of total 
retail sales declined somewhat to a level 
slightly above the average in the third 
quarter. Average producer prices of finished 
goods rose substantially in October, as in 
September, in part because of further large 
increases in prices of foods. The advance in 
the index of average hourly earnings has been 
somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it was 
on the average during 1977. In late October 
the Government announced a new program aimed 
at moderating increases in prices and wages.  

On November 1 a braod program to strengthen 
the dollar in foreign exchange markets and 
thereby to counter continuing domestic inflationary 
pressures was announced. The program included 
an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates 
from 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent, establishment of a 
supplementary reserve requirement of 2 per cent 
against member bank time deposits in denominations 
of $100,000 or more, increases in Federal Reserve 
reciprocal currency arrangements with certain 
central banks, and other measures to mobilize 
key foreign currencies.  

The trade-weighted value of the dollar 
against major foreign currencies declined 
rapidly during the last week of October, but 
following the actions taken to strengthen the 
dollar, it rose sharply to a level somewhat 
above that in early October. The U. S. trade 
deficit was about the same in the third quarter 
as in the second quarter.  

Growth in M-1, which had been rapid in 
August and September, slowed markedly in 
October, and growth in M-2 and M-3 also moder
ated. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits 
included in the broader aggregates slowed some
what, although sales of 6-month money market

certificates at both commercial banks and 
nonbank thrift institutions expanded to record 
levels. Short-term market interest rates have 
risen substantially further since mid-October.  
Bond rates also have increased on balance, 
although they have declined appreciably since 
November 1; mortgage interest rates have con
tinued to rise.  

In light of the foregoing developments, 
it is the policy of the Federal Open Market 
Committee to foster monetary and financial 
conditions that will resist inflationary 
pressures while encouraging continued 
moderate economic expansion and contributing 
to a sustainable pattern of international 
transactions. At its meeting on October 17, 
1978, in setting ranges for the monetary 
aggregates, the Committee recognized the 
uncertainties concerning the effects that the 
November 1 introduction of the automatic 
transfer service (ATS) would have on measures 
of the money supply, especially M-1. Against 
that background, the Committee agreed that 
appropriate monetary and financial conditions 
would be furthered by growth of M-2 and M-3 
from the third quarter of 1978 to the third 
quarter of 1979 within ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 
per cent and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively.  
The narrowly defined money supply (M-1) was 
expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 per 
cent over the period, depending in part on 
the speed and extent of transfers from demand 
to savings deposits resulting from the intro
duction of ATS. The associated range for bank 
credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. Growth 
of M-1+ (M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial 
banks and NOW accounts) in a range of 5 to 
7-1/2 per cent was thought to be generally 
consistent with the ranges of growth for the 
foregoing aggregates. These ranges are subject 
to reconsideration at any time as conditions 
warrant.

11/2 /78

In the short-run, the Committee seeks to 
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions 
that are broadly consistent with the longer
run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, 
while giving due regard to the program for 
supporting the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar, to developing conditions in domestic 
financial markets, and to uncertainties 
associated with the introduction of ATS.  
Early in the period before the next regular 
meeting, System open market operations are to 
be directed at attaining a weekly average 
Federal funds rate slightly above the current 
level. Subsequently, operations shall be 
directed at maintaining the weekly average 
Federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 
to 10 per cent. In deciding on the specific 
objective for the Federal funds rate, the 
Manager is to be guided mainly by a range of 
tolerance for the annual rate of growth over 
the November-December period of 6 to 9-1/2 
per cent in M-2, provided that the rate of 
growth in M-1 does not appear to exceed 5 per 
cent.  

The objective for the funds rate is to be 
raised or lowered within its range if the rate 
of growth of M-2 appears to be close to or 
beyond the upper or lower limit of its range.  
Weight is to be given to M-1 if it appears to 
be growing at a rate close to or above its 
limit.  

If the rates of growth in the aggregates 
appear to be falling outside the limits of the 
indicated ranges at a time when the objective 
for the funds rate has already been moved to the 
corresponding limit of its range, the Manager 
will promptly notify the Chairman, who will 
then decide whether the situation calls for 
supplementary instructions from the Committee.
