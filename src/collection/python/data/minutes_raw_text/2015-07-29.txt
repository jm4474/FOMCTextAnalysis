Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market 
Operations, and Policy Normalization 
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System 
Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on 
developments in domestic and foreign financial markets.  
The deputy manager followed with a discussion of 
System open market operations conducted by the Open 
Market Desk during the period since the Committee met 
on June 16–17.  The Desk’s overnight reverse 
repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operations continued 
to provide a soft floor for money market interest rates.  
The deputy manager also updated the Committee on 
plans for tests of the Term Deposit Facility in August 
and of term RRPs at the end of the third quarter.   

The staff next summarized some of the recent steps the 
System had taken to prepare further for the process of 
normalization of monetary policy.  The staff also 
proposed that future changes in the FOMC’s target 
federal funds rate range as well as associated changes in 
related administered interest rates—including the 
interest rates on excess and required reserves, the ON 
RRP rate, and the primary credit rate—all be effective 
on the day after the Committee’s policy decision.  
Making all such rate changes effective on the same day 
would enhance the clarity of Federal Reserve 
communications.  It would also help promote federal 
funds trading within the new target range, partly by 
enabling the Desk to conduct ON RRP operations at the 
new rate specified by the Committee on the same day 
that the new target range becomes effective.  Participants 
supported the staff proposal.   

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign 
currencies for the System’s account over the 
intermeeting period.   

The Board meeting concluded at the end of the 
discussion of financial markets, open market operations, 
and policy normalization issues.

System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy 
In the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans 
adopted at its September 16–17, 2014 meeting, the 
Committee indicated that it expects to cease or 
commence phasing out reinvestments of principal on 
securities held in the SOMA after it begins increasing the 
target range for the federal funds rate; the timing of this 
decision will depend on how economic and financial 
conditions and the economic outlook evolve.  A staff 
briefing at this meeting provided background on 
alternative strategies the Committee could employ with 
respect to reinvestments.  These strategies included 
either characterizing qualitatively or specifying 
numerically the economic conditions under which 
reinvestments would cease, or establishing a date or time 
interval following the initial firming of the federal funds 
rate for the new policy on reinvestments to begin.  The 
briefing also noted that the Committee could phase out 
reinvestments gradually or end reinvestments all at once.  

In their discussion, most participants expressed a 
preference that the timing of the cessation of 
reinvestments be based on a qualitative assessment of 
economic conditions and the outlook.  Participants 
generally favored continuing reinvestments during the 
early stages of normalization, initially using only 
increases in the target range for the federal funds rate to 
reduce monetary policy accommodation.  This approach 
was viewed as consistent with the Committee’s plans to 
rely on changes in the target range for the federal funds 
rate as the primary indicator of the stance of monetary 
policy.  Most participants thought that it might be best 
either to wind down reinvestments or to manage them 
in a manner that would smooth the decline in the 
balance sheet in a predictable way.  However, some 
participants supported ceasing reinvestments all at once 
at the appropriate time.  Participants indicated a range of 
views on various issues specific to agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) and Treasury markets.  Using 
the same strategy for both agency MBS and Treasury 
maturities was viewed as simpler to communicate, but a 
number of market-specific considerations might suggest 
employing different strategies for each asset class.  No 
decisions regarding the Committee’s strategy for ceasing 
or phasing out reinvestments were made at this meeting.  
Participants requested additional analysis from the staff 
related to alternative approaches to halting or phasing 
out reinvestments, including consideration of the 
possible market effects, and agreed that it would be 
helpful to continue to discuss these issues at upcoming 
meetings. 

Potential Enhancements to the Summary of 
Economic Projections 
Next, participants considered a proposal by the 
subcommittee on communications for a few modest 
modifications to the Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) that could provide further information to the 
public.  A staff briefing reviewed the subcommittee’s 
proposal for publishing median values of the projections 
starting at the time of the September meeting, noting 
that public commentary frequently focuses on the 
midpoint of the central tendency of the projections and 
that medians would provide a more robust summary 
measure of the distribution of participants’ views.  The 
subcommittee also proposed the removal of the 
histogram depicting participants’ preferred year of liftoff 
from the SEP exhibits at the time that the Committee 
decides to commence the normalization process or in 
the first SEP thereafter.  In their comments, participants 
noted that the inclusion of medians would provide an 
additional useful summary statistic of participants’ 
perspectives; however, they also emphasized that the 
medians would not represent a collective view or 
Committee forecast.  Participants unanimously 
supported the addition of medians for all variables—
economic growth, the unemployment rate, total and 
core inflation, and individual assessments of the 
projected appropriate federal funds rate—to the 
September SEP and the removal of the histogram of 
preferred liftoff years following the commencement of 
normalization.  The briefing also raised the possibility of 
eventually including graphs in the SEP that would 
illustrate the uncertainty that attends participants’ 
macroeconomic projections, but noted that further work 
was needed before a specific proposal could be 
presented to the Committee.  The Chair asked the 
subcommittee on communications to continue to 
investigate the possibility of incorporating a graphical 
depiction of uncertainty into the SEP. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the July 28–29 meeting 
suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 
moderately in the second quarter after edging down in 
the first quarter, and that labor market conditions con-
tinued to improve.  Consumer price inflation continued 
to run below the FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 per-
cent, restrained by earlier declines in energy prices and 
further decreases in non-energy import prices.  Survey 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained 
stable, while market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation were still low. 

Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand 
at a solid pace in June.  The unemployment rate declined 
to 5.3 percent, its lowest reading so far this year, and the 
share of workers employed part time edged lower; how-
ever, the labor force participation rate and the employ-
ment-to-population ratio both moved down.  The rate 
of private-sector job openings was unchanged in May at 
a high level, and the rates of hiring and quits were also 
little changed.  On balance, labor market indicators sug-
gested that underutilization of labor resources had di-
minished since early this year. 

After declining for five consecutive months, industrial 
production rose in June, partly reflecting an increase in 
the output of mines.  Nonetheless, for the second quar-
ter as a whole, mining output contracted sharply and 
manufacturing production rose only modestly; both sec-
tors were weak over the first half of the year, likely re-
flecting the continuing effects of earlier increases in the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar and lower crude oil 
prices.  Automakers’ assembly schedules pointed to a 
solid gain in light motor vehicle production in the third 
quarter, but broader indicators of manufacturing pro-
duction, including readings on new orders from national 
and regional manufacturing surveys, generally suggested 
only modest increases in factory output in the coming 
months. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to have risen at a solid pace in the second quarter.  
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its esti-
mate of PCE edged down in June, but the decline for 
that group of components followed a strong reading in 
May.  Similarly, light vehicle sales in June partly reversed 
a large increase in May but remained robust.  Among the 
factors that influence household spending, real disposa-
ble income rose in May and gains in households’ net 
worth were supported by further advances in home val-
ues.  Moreover, consumer sentiment in the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers in early July remained 
near its highest level since before the most recent reces-
sion. 

Activity in the housing sector improved somewhat in re-
cent months but remained slow.  Starts of new single-
family houses declined in June but rose for the quarter 
as a whole, and the level of permit issuance pointed to 
increases in starts in subsequent months.  In the multi-
family sector, starts and permits increased sharply in 
June, likely reflecting in large part a pull-forward of ac-
tivity due to an expiring tax credit in New York City.  
Sales of new homes declined in June; in contrast, existing 

home sales increased and pending home sales were at a 
level consistent with little change in closed sales over the 
next couple of months. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property products appeared to rise at a modest 
rate in the second quarter.  Nominal shipments of non-
defense capital goods excluding aircraft were little 
changed in June.  Forward-looking indicators, such as 
new orders for these capital goods along with national 
and regional surveys of business conditions, pointed to 
further modest increases in business equipment spend-
ing in the near term.  Real spending for nonresidential 
structures excluding drilling and mining appeared to rise 
solidly in the second quarter, as firms’ nominal outlays 
for such structures increased at a robust pace again in 
May.  In contrast, real business spending for drilling and 
mining structures likely fell sharply last quarter, con-
sistent with the drop in the number of oil rigs in opera-
tion.  However, the rig count appeared to be bottoming 
out in recent weeks. 

Nominal federal spending data through June indicated 
that real federal government purchases likely decreased 
in the second quarter.  However, real state and local gov-
ernment purchases appeared to have risen last quarter, 
as nominal construction spending rebounded following 
a decline in the first quarter and payrolls for these gov-
ernments were little changed. 

After narrowing in April, the U.S. international trade 
deficit widened in May, as exports decreased more than 
imports.  The decrease in exports largely reflected a fall 
in aircraft shipments.  The decline in imports was driven 
by reductions in imports of capital goods, particularly 
computers and oilfield equipment.  By contrast, imports 
of automotive products increased to a record level.  
While real net exports made a large negative contribu-
tion to the change in real GDP in the first quarter of 
2015, the available trade data indicated that the drag on 
GDP growth exerted by net exports in the second quar-
ter was considerably smaller. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, only edged up over the 12 months ending in 
May, held down primarily by earlier large declines in en-
ergy prices.  Core PCE inflation, which excludes food 
and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same period, 
restrained in part by declines in the prices of non-energy 
imports.  Over the 12 months ending in June, total con-
sumer prices as measured by the consumer price index 
(CPI) were little changed, while the core CPI increased 
1¾ percent.  Measures of expected longer-run inflation 
from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained sta-
ble.  However, market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation were still low, although they were somewhat 
higher than early in the year.  Over the 12 months ending 
in June, nominal average hourly earnings for all employ-
ees increased 2 percent. 

Foreign economic growth appeared to remain subdued 
in the second quarter.  In Canada, indicators suggested 
that low oil prices weighed on investment in the energy 
sector, and energy production in April was curtailed by 
wildfires and maintenance shutdowns.  Economic activ-
ity also weakened in some Latin American countries.  By 
contrast, second-quarter economic growth was strong in 
China and in the United Kingdom, and euro-area indi-
cators were consistent with continued moderate eco-
nomic expansion.  Headline foreign inflation remained 
low, importantly reflecting past oil price declines. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Financial conditions were affected by developments 
abroad over the intermeeting period but were little 
changed on balance.  Federal Reserve communications 
and economic data releases, including the June employ-
ment report and retail sales data, put some downward 
pressure on the path of expected future short-term in-
terest rates.  On net, 5-year and 10-year Treasury yields 
were somewhat lower, measures of inflation compensa-
tion over the next 5 years based on Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities declined, equity prices were little 
changed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
rose modestly. 

The expected path of the federal funds rate moved down 
following the June FOMC statement and the Chair’s 
postmeeting press conference.  Market participants re-
portedly saw as notable the downward revisions in the 
June SEP to FOMC participants’ projections of the ap-
propriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 
2015.  Results from the Desk’s July Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that 
a majority of respondents to both surveys continued to 
view the September 2015 meeting as the most likely time 
for the first increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate; however, respondents to both surveys con-
tinued to place significant probability on scenarios in 
which the first increase in the target range occurred at 
subsequent meetings.  As in the June survey, after the 
initial increase, respondents expected the target range for 
the federal funds rate to rise only gradually. 

Over the intermeeting period, market yields fluctuated 
in response to news about developments abroad, includ-
ing Greek debt negotiations.  Yields on 5- and 10-year 

nominal Treasury securities fell somewhat on net.     
Market-based measures of inflation compensation over 
the next 5 years moved lower amid a decline in oil prices, 
whereas inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was 
relatively stable. 

On balance, broad U.S. equity price indexes were little 
changed over the intermeeting period.  Option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index over the next month in-
creased for a time in response to foreign developments 
before falling back to the lower end of its range over re-
cent years.  Based on reports from about 40 percent of 
firms in the S&P 500 index, earnings per share in the 
second quarter were about unchanged or slightly higher 
than their first-quarter levels.  Spreads on 10-year triple-
B-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened some-
what over the period. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms continued 
to be accommodative.  Corporate bond issuance re-
mained strong in the second quarter; issuance of institu-
tional leveraged loans picked up noticeably, likely due in 
part to tighter loan spreads as compared with the begin-
ning of the year.  Commercial and industrial loans on 
banks’ balance sheets continued to expand. 

Financing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained 
broadly available.  CRE loans on banks’ books expanded 
in the second quarter, consistent with stronger loan de-
mand reported in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS).  Issuance 
of commercial mortgage-backed securities continued to 
be robust. 

According to available measures, residential mortgage 
lending conditions stayed accommodative for many con-
sumers.  However, credit conditions remained tight for 
riskier borrowers, such as those with low credit scores, 
undocumented income, or high debt-to-income ratios.  
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were little 
changed, in line with MBS yields and other longer-term 
interest rates. 

Outstanding balances of auto and student loans contin-
ued to expand at a robust pace through May.  Banks in-
dicated in the July SLOOS that their lending standards 
for credit card loans had eased somewhat relative to the 
past few years.  However, a number of indicators sug-
gested that terms on credit card loans remained tight, es-
pecially for subprime borrowers.  

Credit conditions in municipal bond markets were stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Despite the announce-
ment that Puerto Rico might seek to restructure at least 

Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



part of its debt, spreads on an index of 20-year general 
obligation municipal bonds over comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities changed little, and the pace of issu-
ance of long-term municipal bonds remained robust. 

After having widened amid concerns about the difficult 
negotiations between Greece and its creditors, Greek 
and other peripheral euro-area sovereign spreads nar-
rowed, on net, over the intermeeting period as news 
emerged of progress toward an agreement.  In China, 
stock prices fell substantially, prompting a number of 
policy and regulatory actions by Chinese officials to sup-
port the stock market.  While these developments at-
tracted investor attention, reaction in asset markets out-
side Greece and China was limited on balance. 

Sovereign bond yields and monetary policy expectations 
in the United Kingdom changed little, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  By contrast, yields in Canada, New 
Zealand, Norway, and Sweden decreased following 
weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data releases and 
additional monetary policy accommodation.  The for-
eign exchange value of the U.S. dollar increased during 
the intermeeting period against the currencies of major 
U.S. trading partners.  Stock markets in most advanced 
foreign economies ended the period higher.  Equity 
prices in emerging market economies, however, gener-
ally moved lower on net. 

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability.  The strong capital position of the U.S. 
banking sector, low to moderate use of leverage else-
where in the financial system, stability in the level of ma-
turity transformation by financial institutions, and still-
moderate rates of borrowing by the private nonfinancial 
sector were seen as factors supporting overall financial 
stability.  However, rising debt burdens for riskier busi-
nesses as well as somewhat elevated valuations and loos-
ening lending standards for many asset classes pointed 
to some increasing concerns.  The effect of financial 
stresses related to Greece and China on the largest U.S. 
financial firms was limited to date, perhaps reflecting the 
relatively strong financial positions and low direct expo-
sures among such firms and a view among market par-
ticipants that foreign authorities would take actions to 
stem spillovers. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
July FOMC meeting was broadly similar to that prepared 
for the June FOMC meeting.  Real GDP was again ex-
pected to increase faster in the second half of this year 
than in the first half and to expand more rapidly than 

potential output in 2016 and 2017, even as the normali-
zation of the stance of monetary policy was assumed to 
proceed.  However, real GDP growth over the medium 
term was revised down a small amount, in part because 
of a slightly stronger forecast for the exchange value of 
the dollar.  The staff also made two small adjustments to 
its supply-side assumptions.  First, the projected rates of 
productivity gains and potential output growth over the 
medium term were trimmed.  With actual and potential 
GDP growth both a bit weaker, the projected narrowing 
of the output gap over the medium term was little re-
vised.  Second, the staff lowered slightly its estimate of 
the longer-run natural rate of unemployment.  The un-
employment rate was expected to decline gradually to 
this revised estimate. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down, par-
ticularly in the near term, as the decline in crude oil 
prices over the intermeeting period was expected to re-
sult in lower consumer energy prices.  Although energy 
prices and non-oil import prices were expected to begin 
rising steadily next year, the staff continued to project 
that inflation would be below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent over 2016 and 2017.  Inflation 
was anticipated to move up gradually to 2 percent there-
after, with inflation expectations in the longer run as-
sumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective 
and slack in labor and product markets projected to have 
waned. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its July projec-
tions for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  
The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were 
seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s as-
sessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well 
positioned to help the economy withstand substantial 
adverse shocks.  At the same time, the staff viewed the 
risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as 
roughly balanced. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants viewed the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as suggesting that 
economic activity had been expanding moderately in re-
cent months.  The pace of job gains had been solid and 
the unemployment rate had declined, with a range of la-
bor market indicators suggesting that underutilization of 
labor resources had continued to diminish.  Participants 
generally viewed the incoming data as confirming their 
earlier assessment that the weak report on real GDP in 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the first quarter reflected transitory factors and expected 
that real economic activity would continue to expand at 
a moderate pace over the balance of the year, leading to 
further improvement in labor market conditions.  How-
ever, a few participants observed that although GDP 
growth appeared to have picked up in recent months rel-
ative to the first-quarter pace, the level of GDP re-
mained lower than had been projected earlier in the year.  
Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 per-
cent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier de-
clines in energy prices and further decreases in prices of 
non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation remained low, while survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained 
stable.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation 
would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor mar-
ket improved further and the transitory effects of earlier 
declines in energy and import prices dissipated.  Alt-
hough many continued to see some downside risks aris-
ing from economic and financial developments abroad, 
participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for 
domestic economic activity and the labor market as 
nearly balanced. 

With respect to consumer spending, the incoming data 
had been uneven but participants cited reports from 
contacts suggesting a pickup since the first quarter.  Par-
ticipants generally expected consumer spending to rise 
moderately over the near term.  Continued gains in em-
ployment and income, high household net worth, and 
low gasoline prices were viewed as factors that should 
support consumer spending in coming months.  Con-
sumer credit conditions were also seen as favorable, with 
business contacts pointing to steady loan growth, espe-
cially for auto loans and credit cards.  However, a couple 
of participants were concerned about the outlook for 
consumer spending, noting that spending had been dis-
appointing in recent months even though real income 
had already been boosted by the lower gasoline prices 
and the improved labor market. 

Participants viewed the recent data on housing starts and 
permits as well as the higher levels of sales and prices as 
indicative of continued recovery in the housing sector.  
The easing of lending standards for residential mort-
gages evidenced in the most recent SLOOS was cited as 
a factor likely to support further progress.  However, a 
couple of participants noted that they did not expect this 
sector to be a major contributor to economic growth 
over the remainder of the year. 

Participants also observed that activity in other sectors 
of the economy continued to be subdued.  Business 

fixed investment remained soft even as the drag from 
the sharp contraction in drilling rigs over the first half of 
this year appeared to be fading.  Although investment 
spending was expected to pick up over the second half 
of this year, a few participants were concerned that the 
further decline in oil prices that had occurred in recent 
weeks might continue to hold down energy-related in-
vestment.  In addition, government spending was ex-
pected to add very little to growth in aggregate spending 
this year.  Participants also expected net exports to con-
tinue to subtract from GDP growth over the second half 
of the year, reflecting in part the damping influence of 
the dollar’s earlier appreciation. 

Industry contacts pointed to generally solid business 
conditions, with firms in many parts of the country con-
tinuing to report positive assessments of current activity 
and optimism about future sales.  Manufacturing activity 
had slowed somewhat over the intermeeting period, but 
conditions were mixed across different industries.  
Those firms connected to the auto, aerospace, and con-
struction industries, for example, reported strong de-
mand.  However, businesses particularly exposed to the 
appreciation of the dollar or falling commodity prices—
including those in the heavy equipment and steel, oil and 
gas extraction, and petrochemical industries—reported 
slower activity.  The service sector reports were mostly 
positive.  Overall, most contacts viewed the recent slow-
down in manufacturing as likely to prove temporary and 
remained optimistic about future demand, even though 
the recent decreases in oil prices and the possibility of 
adverse spillovers from slower economic growth in 
China raised some concerns.  Regarding the agricultural 
sector, a very wet spring had significantly reduced the 
percentage of crops in good condition, and declining 
commodity prices had further reduced expectations for 
farm income. 

In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, par-
ticipants generally viewed the risks from the fiscal and 
financial problems in Greece as having diminished 
somewhat, although it was observed that Greece still 
faced many challenges and that Greek economic pro-
gress was likely to be limited over the near term.  While 
the recent Chinese stock market decline seemed to have 
had limited implications to date for the growth outlook 
in China, several participants noted that a material slow-
down in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to 
the U.S. economic outlook.  Some participants also dis-
cussed the risk that a possible divergence in interest rates 
in the United States and abroad might lead to further

appreciation of the dollar, extending the downward pres-
sure on commodity prices and the weakness in net ex-
ports. 

Participants agreed that labor market conditions had im-
proved further, citing increases in payroll employment 
and job openings, the decrease in the unemployment 
rate, and some further reduction in broader measures of 
labor market underutilization.  Although the labor force 
participation rate declined in June and the national hiring 
and quits rates were little changed in May, several partic-
ipants noted that reports from business contacts in their 
Districts pointed to continued job gains and relatively 
strong labor markets.  They cited anecdotal reports of 
firms having concerns about retaining workers and fac-
ing difficulties in filling even medium- and lower-skilled 
jobs.  However, several participants contended that, de-
spite the progress over the past few years, some notice-
able margins of slack remained, citing as evidence the 
high number of workers not actively searching for jobs 
but available and interested in work as well as the high 
share of employees working part time for economic rea-
sons compared with pre-recession levels. 

The ongoing rise in labor demand still appeared not to 
have led to a broad-based firming of wage increases.  
While business contacts in a number of Districts contin-
ued to report that the pace of wage increases had picked 
up, recent national readings on hourly compensation and 
average hourly earnings of employees had remained sub-
dued.  The most recent employment cost index, released 
in April, had suggested an increase in wage gains.  How-
ever, questions were raised about how to interpret this 
reading because the pickup was concentrated in the 
Northeast and might have resulted from particular fac-
tors that were not associated solely with a general tight-
ening of labor market conditions, such as minimum 
wage adjustments and market conditions in certain oc-
cupations.  In addition, it was noted that considerable 
uncertainty remained about when wages might begin to 
accelerate and whether that development might translate 
into increased price inflation. 

Participants discussed how recent developments influ-
enced their expectations for reaching the FOMC’s 2 per-
cent inflation objective over the medium term.  Total 
PCE inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective.  Core PCE price inflation, as meas-
ured on a 12-month change basis, also remained low, but 
other measures, such as the trimmed mean PCE and me-
dian CPI, continued to run at higher levels than core 
PCE inflation.  Moreover, core CPI inflation had picked 

up over recent months.  Some participants cited down-
side risks to inflation, pointing to the absence of any no-
ticeable response of inflation to the reduction in re-
source slack over the past several years, risks of further 
declines in oil and commodity prices, and the possibility 
of further appreciation in the dollar.  Although most 
readings on longer-term inflation expectations were little 
changed recently, participants discussed how to interpret 
downward movements in some survey and market-
based measures of inflation expectations over the past 
few years.  Most participants still expected that the 
downward pressure on inflation from the previous de-
clines in energy prices and the effects of past dollar ap-
preciation would prove to be temporary.  Participants 
generally continued to anticipate that, with appropriate 
monetary policy, inflation would move up to the Com-
mittee’s objective over the medium term, reflecting the 
anticipated tightening of product and labor markets and 
stable longer-term inflation expectations. 

Participants discussed a range of topics associated with 
financial market developments and financial stability.  
They commented on issues related to the deterioration 
in bond market liquidity reported by market participants, 
the potential migration of leveraged loan underwriting to 
the nonbank sector in light of current supervisory guid-
ance, and the assessment of valuation risks when term 
premiums were narrow while most other risk premiums 
were not.  In addition, it was observed that Puerto Rico 
faced significant challenges servicing its debts, though 
the risks of contagion to other U.S. financial markets 
were judged to be low.  Participants also noted the chal-
lenges associated with identifying newly emerging risks 
as well as the implications for monetary policy of a hy-
pothetical future situation in which financial imbalances 
were increasing. 

During their discussion of economic conditions and 
monetary policy, participants mentioned a number of 
considerations associated with the timing and pace of 
policy normalization.  Most judged that the conditions 
for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they 
noted that conditions were approaching that point.  Par-
ticipants observed that the labor market had improved 
notably since early this year, but many saw scope for 
some further improvement.  Many participants indicated 
that their outlook for sustained economic growth and 
further improvement in labor markets was key in sup-
porting their expectation that inflation would move up 
to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and that they 
would be looking for evidence that the economic out-
look was evolving as they anticipated.  However, some 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



participants expressed the view that the incoming infor-
mation had not yet provided grounds for reasonable 
confidence that inflation would move back to 2 percent 
over the medium term and that the inflation outlook 
thus might not soon meet one of the conditions estab-
lished by the Committee for initiating a firming of policy.  
Several of these participants cited evidence that the re-
sponse of inflation to the elimination of resource slack 
might be attenuated and expressed concern about risks 
of further downward pressure on inflation from interna-
tional developments.  Another concern related to the 
risk of premature policy tightening was the limited ability 
of monetary policy to offset downside shocks to infla-
tion and economic activity when the federal funds rate 
was near its effective lower bound. 

Some participants, however, emphasized that the econ-
omy had made significant progress over the past few 
years and viewed the economic conditions for beginning 
to increase the target range for the federal funds rate as 
having been met or were confident that they would be 
met shortly.  A few of these participants judged that the 
stance of monetary policy, including the extraordinarily 
low level of the federal funds rate and the current size of 
the Federal Reserve balance sheet, was very accommo-
dative.  A couple of others thought that an appreciable 
delay in beginning the process of normalization might 
result in an undesirable increase in inflation or have ad-
verse consequences for financial stability.  Some partici-
pants advised that progress toward the Committee’s ob-
jectives should be viewed in light of the cumulative gains 
made to date without overemphasizing month-to-
month changes in incoming data.  It was also noted that 
a prompt start to normalization would likely convey the 
Committee’s confidence in prospects for the economy. 

In their discussion of the appropriate path for the federal 
funds rate and associated communications at and after 
the time of the first increase in the target range, partici-
pants expressed support for emphasizing that the course 
of policy would remain conditional on the Committee’s 
assessment of economic developments and the outlook 
relative to its objectives.  It was also noted that the Com-
mittee’s communications around the time of the first 
rate increase should emphasize that the expected path 
for policy, not the initial increase, would be the most im-
portant determinant of financial conditions and should 
acknowledge that policy would continue to be accom-
modative to support progress toward the Committee’s 
dual objectives.  While monetary policy adjustments ul-
timately would be data dependent, some participants ex-
pressed the view that, in light of their current outlook, it 
likely would be appropriate to adjust the federal funds 

rate gradually after the first increase to help ensure that 
the economy would be able to absorb higher interest 
rates and that inflation was moving toward the Commit-
tee’s objective. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in June indicated that economic activity 
had been expanding moderately in recent months.  The 
labor market had also continued to improve, with solid 
job gains and declining unemployment.  A range of labor 
market indicators, on balance, suggested that underutili-
zation of labor resources had diminished since early this 
year.  Members generally viewed these developments, to-
gether with appropriate monetary policy accommoda-
tion, as supporting their expectations for moderate eco-
nomic growth in the medium term and for further im-
provement in labor market conditions.  They also con-
tinued to see the risks to the outlook for economic ac-
tivity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation 
had continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective, but members expected it to rise gradually to-
ward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor mar-
ket improved further and the transitory effects of earlier 
declines in energy and import prices dissipated. 

In assessing whether economic conditions had im-
proved sufficiently to initiate a firming in the stance of 
monetary policy, the Committee noted that, on balance, 
a range of labor market indicators suggested that un-
derutilization of labor resources had diminished further.  
Most members saw room for some additional progress 
in reducing labor market slack, although several viewed 
current labor market conditions as at or very close to 
those consistent with maximum employment.  Many 
members thought that labor market underutilization 
would be largely eliminated in the near term if economic 
activity evolved as they expected.  However, several were 
concerned that labor market conditions consistent with 
maximum employment could take longer to achieve, 
noting, for example, the lack of convincing signs of ac-
celerating wages, which might be signaling that the nat-
ural rate of unemployment could currently be lower than 
they previously thought. 

In considering the Committee’s criteria with respect to 
inflation for beginning policy normalization, most mem-
bers viewed the incoming data as reinforcing their earlier 
assessment that, although inflation continued to run be-
low the Committee’s objective, the downward pressure 
on inflation from the previous decreases in energy prices 
and the effects of past dollar appreciation would abate.  

Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



However, core inflation on a year-over-year basis also 
was still below 2 percent.  Moreover, some members 
continued to see downside risks to inflation from the 
possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in 
commodity prices.  In addition, several members noted 
that higher rates of resource utilization appeared to have 
had only very limited effects to date on wages and prices, 
and underscored the uncertainty surrounding the infla-
tion process as well as the role and dynamics of inflation 
expectations.  The Committee agreed to continue to 
monitor inflation developments closely, with almost all 
members indicating that they would need to see more 
evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong 
and labor markets conditions had firmed enough for 
them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would 
return to the Committee’s longer-run objective over the 
medium term. 

The Committee concluded that, although it had seen fur-
ther progress, the economic conditions warranting an in-
crease in the target range for the federal funds rate had 
not yet been met.  Members generally agreed that addi-
tional information on the outlook would be necessary 
before deciding to implement an increase in the target 
range.  One member, however, indicated a readiness to 
take that step at this meeting but was willing to wait for 
additional data to confirm a judgment to raise the target 
range. 

In their discussion of language for the postmeeting state-
ment, members agreed that the wording should reflect 
their assessment that economic conditions showed con-
tinued progress toward the Committee’s objectives.  The 
Committee updated the statement to indicate that eco-
nomic activity had been expanding moderately in recent 
months and that it had seen further improvement in la-
bor market conditions over the intermeeting period, 
pointing specifically to solid job gains and declining un-
employment.  In addition, the Committee agreed to state 
that a range of labor market indicators suggested that 
underutilization of labor resources had diminished since 
early this year, acknowledging the cumulative progress 
that had been made in the labor market.  The Committee 
also modified the discussion of inflation developments 
slightly to recognize the more recent declines in energy 
prices while restating the expectation that inflation 
would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium 
term as the labor market improved further and the tran-
sitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import 
prices dissipated. 

The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm 

in the statement that the Committee’s decision about 
how long to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of ac-
tual and expected progress toward its objectives of max-
imum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Members 
also agreed that their evaluation of progress on their ob-
jectives would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  To further reflect the Committee’s assessment 
that economic conditions had continued to progress to-
ward its objectives, the Committee slightly altered its 
characterization of when it anticipates that it will be ap-
propriate to begin the process of policy normalization.  
Specifically, members agreed to indicate the Commit-
tee’s anticipation that it would be appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen 
some further improvement in the labor market and is 
reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 
2 percent objective over the medium term. 

The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from agency debt and agency     
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-
ties at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s 
holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, 
should help maintain accommodative financial condi-
tions.  The Committee reiterated its expectation that, 
even after employment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some 
time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 
¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk 
to undertake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain such conditions.  The 
Committee directs the Desk to maintain its 
policy of rolling over maturing Treasury 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



securities into new issues and its policy of 
reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities 
in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in 
dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the 
Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.  The System Open 
Market Account manager and the secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 
sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in June indicates that 
economic activity has been expanding moder-
ately in recent months.  Growth in household 
spending has been moderate and the housing 
sector has shown additional improvement; 
however, business fixed investment and net 
exports stayed soft.  The labor market contin-
ued to improve, with solid job gains and de-
clining unemployment.  On balance, a range 
of labor market indicators suggests that un-
derutilization of labor resources has dimin-
ished since early this year.  Inflation continued 
to run below the Committee’s longer-run ob-
jective, partly reflecting earlier declines in en-
ergy prices and decreasing prices of non-en-
ergy imports.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation ex-
pectations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  The Committee ex-
pects that, with appropriate policy accommo-
dation, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace, with labor market indicators 
continuing to move toward levels the Com-
mittee judges consistent with its dual man-
date.  The Committee continues to see the 
risks to the outlook for economic activity and 
the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation 
is anticipated to remain near its recent low 

level in the near term, but the Committee ex-
pects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 per-
cent over the medium term as the labor mar-
ket improves further and the transitory effects 
of earlier declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate.  The Committee continues to mon-
itor inflation developments closely. 

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that the 
current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In de-
termining how long to maintain this target 
range, the Committee will assess progress—
both realized and expected—toward its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indica-
tors of inflation pressures and inflation expec-
tations, and readings on financial and interna-
tional developments.  The Committee antici-
pates that it will be appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate when it 
has seen some further improvement in the la-
bor market and is reasonably confident that 
inflation will move back to its 2 percent ob-
jective over the medium term. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treas-
ury securities at auction.  This policy, by keep-
ing the Committee’s holdings of longer-term 
securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

When the Committee decides to begin to re-
move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-
anced approach consistent with its longer-run 
goals of maximum employment and inflation 
of 2 percent.  The Committee currently antic-
ipates that, even after employment and infla-
tion are near mandate-consistent levels, eco-
nomic conditions may, for some time, warrant 
keeping the target federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run.”

Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation 
Framework 
At the conclusion of the meeting, the Chair noted that 
the staff would soon begin an extended effort to evaluate 
potential long-run monetary policy implementation 
frameworks.  In view of the likely time frames for nor-
malization of the stance of monetary policy and the Sys-
tem’s balance sheet, the Committee probably would not 
need to reach any final decisions regarding such a frame-
work for several years.  Moreover, the process of nor-
malization will likely provide a great deal of information 
about money markets and the Federal Reserve’s policy 
tools that will help inform the Committee’s judgment 
about a long-run implementation framework.  Nonethe-
less, because the analysis will likely address a wide range 
of topics, it seemed appropriate to begin now to organ-
ize and undertake the work. 

Previous staff work on implementation frameworks was 
presented to the Committee in April 2008 and focused 
largely on alternative frameworks that could be used to 
target the federal funds rate.  Those topics would be an 
important part of the current undertaking as well.  How-
ever, in light of experience over recent years, policymak-
ers agreed that a number of related issues warranted at-
tention, including topics such as the effectiveness of al-
ternative implementation frameworks in scenarios that 
could require a return to the zero lower bound, regula-
tory and other structural developments that could affect 
financial institutions and markets in ways that would af-

fect monetary policy implementation, and the long-run 
structure of the Federal Reserve’s assets and liabilities 
that best supports the System’s macroeconomic objec-
tives and financial stability.  In discussing the range of 
issues contemplated for study under this project, it was 
noted that the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans 
reflect the Committee’s intention that, in the longer run, 
the Federal Reserve will hold no more securities than 
necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and 
effectively and that the Federal Reserve will hold primar-
ily Treasury securities. 

Policymakers agreed that it would be important to draw 
on the perspectives of staff across the Federal Reserve 
System and to consult widely with other central banks, 
academics, and other experts on markets, financial insti-
tutions, and monetary policy.  The project was expected 
to run through the end of 2016.  Policymakers will re-
view progress and provide input as the work proceeds. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, September  
16–17, 2015.  The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. on 
July 29, 2015. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on July 7, 2015, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on June 16–17, 2015.
