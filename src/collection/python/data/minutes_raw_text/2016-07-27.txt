Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation 
Framework 
The staff provided several briefings that reviewed pro-
gress on a long-term effort begun in July 2015 to evalu-
ate potential long-run frameworks for monetary policy 
implementation.  The briefings highlighted some foun-
dational considerations that are relevant for such an 
evaluation.  The staff described the recent experience of 
several central banks of advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs) in implementing monetary policy, noting that 
they use a wide variety of frameworks to control short-
term interest rates and that their approaches have 
evolved over time.  For example, foreign central banks 
vary in their choice of the interest rate used to communi-
cate monetary policy; in their approach to the provision 
of reserve balances; and in their use of policies, such as 
large-scale asset purchases, various funding programs, 
and negative interest rates, to supplement more tradi-
tional means of policy implementation.  The staff also 
described the Federal Reserve’s experience in imple-
menting monetary policy during the recent financial cri-
sis.  Before the financial crisis, traditional implementa-
tion tools—relatively small-sized open market opera-
tions and discount window lending—were adequate for 
interest rate control even during periods of stress.  But 
the evidence from the period of the crisis and its after-
math suggested that the Federal Reserve’s pre-crisis 
framework did not enable close control over the federal 
funds rate when liquidity programs were expanded sig-
nificantly and subsequently was unable to generate suf-
ficiently accommodative financial conditions to support 
economic recovery without the use of new policy tools.  
Finally, the staff noted that various aspects of U.S. 
money markets, which determine short-term interest 
rates and are important for transmitting monetary policy, 
have changed since the financial crisis.  The differences 
include changes the Federal Reserve has made to its pol-
icy tools and balance sheet, changes in market partici-
pants’ business practices, and the regulatory changes 
made around the globe to strengthen the financial sys-
tem.  Taken together, these factors may, for example, 
raise the long-run demand for safe assets, including re-
serve balances, and they should help make U.S. money 
markets more stable than they were before and during 
the financial crisis. 

In the discussion that followed the staff presentations, 
policymakers agreed that decisions regarding an appro-
priate long-run implementation framework would not 
be necessary for some time.  Furthermore, their judg-
ments regarding a future framework would benefit from 
accruing additional experience with recently developed

policy tools, such as the payment of interest on reserves, 
and accumulating more information about some im-
portant considerations that are still evolving, including 
financial regulations and market participants’ responses 
to them. 

One key consideration discussed by policymakers was 
the appropriate amount of flexibility that an implemen-
tation framework might have—for example, the extent 
to which a framework could readily enable interest rate 
control under a wide range of economic and financial 
circumstances.  With neutral interest rates potentially re-
maining quite low, policymakers also observed that, in 
order to promote the Federal Reserve’s policy objec-
tives, the framework should have the capacity to supple-
ment conventional policy accommodation with other 
measures when short-term nominal interest rates are 
near zero.  Policymakers emphasized that the relation-
ship between the monetary policy implementation 
framework and financial stability considerations would 
require careful attention.  Importantly, the policy imple-
mentation framework would need to be consistent with 
recent changes in regulation designed to enhance the sta-
bility of the financial system.  Also, because episodes of 
financial stress can arise with little warning, policymakers 
noted the advantage of being operationally ready for 
such situations; however, they also recognized that such 
operational readiness could entail some costs.  Partici-
pants observed that various choices associated with pol-
icy implementation frameworks—such as the selection 
of counterparties or types of collateral to accept, and the 
overall size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet—may both be influenced by, and them-
selves influence, incentives and activity in financial mar-
kets.  Moreover, they indicated that the implications of 
the implementation framework for the efficiency of the 
financial system needed to be taken into account. 

Meeting participants commented on several other con-
siderations that they saw as being relevant for evaluating 
possible implementation frameworks.  Other major cen-
tral banks have successfully employed a range of policy 
rates, including both administered rates and market 
rates, suggesting that either type of rate can be effective 
in communicating and implementing policy.  However, 
the factors affecting market rates, as well as the relation-
ships between the policy interest rate and other short-
term interest rates, would need to be well understood in 
deciding on a particular policy rate.  The potential bene-
fits of improving the functioning of certain policy tools 
were noted; for example, approaches to reducing the 

perceived stigma associated with borrowing at the dis-
count window, particularly in periods of financial strain, 
would need further careful consideration.  In addition, it 
was noted that the dollar is a principal reserve currency 
and that monetary transmission in the United States oc-
curs through funding markets that are quite globally con-
nected.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Chair 
asked the staff to continue its work and noted that poli-
cymakers would review further analysis at a future meet-
ing. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open  
Market Operations 
The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac-
count (SOMA) reported on developments in financial 
markets and open market operations during the period 
since the Committee met on June 14–15, 2016.  Follow-
ing the outcome of the June 23 referendum in the United 
Kingdom in which a majority indicated a preference to 
leave the European Union (EU), yields on U.S. Treasury 
securities fell sharply, U.S. equity prices declined, and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar increased.  How-
ever, these changes generally reversed in subsequent 
weeks.  On balance, Treasury yields were down only 
slightly over the intermeeting period, equity prices were 
higher, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was 
little changed.  Although the expected path of the federal 
funds rate implied by market prices was about un-
changed on net, the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indi-
cated that the median responses for the most likely path 
of the federal funds rate over coming quarters had de-
clined. 

During the intermeeting period, federal funds continued 
to trade at rates well within the FOMC’s ¼ to ½ percent 
target range.  However, the average effective federal 
funds rate was modestly higher than in the previous in-
termeeting period.  The slightly firmer conditions in the 
federal funds market were supported by higher rates in 
money markets for secured transactions, which appeared 
to reflect at least in part more cautious liquidity manage-
ment by some money market participants in the wake of 
the U.K. referendum.  Take-up at the System’s overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement facility rose somewhat.  
The increase seemed to be in part the result of shifts in 
investments by money market funds in advance of the 
scheduled implementation in October of changes to the 
regulation of the money market fund industry. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.

There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the July 26–27 meeting in-
dicated that labor market conditions generally improved 
in June and that growth in real gross domestic product 
(GDP) was moderate in the second quarter.  Consumer 
price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by 
earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-
energy imports.  Most survey-based measures of longer-
run inflation expectations were little changed, on bal-
ance, while market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation remained low. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased briskly in 
June, but the increase for the second quarter as a whole 
was noticeably slower than in the first quarter.  The un-
employment rate rose to 4.9 percent in June, partly re-
versing its decline in the previous month.  The labor 
force participation rate edged up in June, while the  
employment-to-population ratio edged down.  The 
share of workers employed part time for economic rea-
sons declined in June after a similarly sized increase in 
May.  The rate of private-sector job openings declined in 
May, albeit from an elevated level, and the rates of hires 
and of quits were both unchanged.  The four-week mov-
ing average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits remained low through mid-July.  Average 
hourly earnings for all employees increased 2½ percent 
over the 12 months ending in June. 

The unemployment rates for African Americans and for 
Hispanics stayed above the rate for whites, although the 
differentials in jobless rates across the different groups 
were similar to those before the most recent recession.  
A similar pattern among demographic groups held for a 
broader measure of labor underutilization that also in-
cludes persons who were marginally attached to the la-
bor force and those who were employed part time for 
economic reasons.  

Total industrial production rose modestly, on net, in 
May and June, primarily reflecting an increase in the out-
put of utilities in June related to unseasonably warm 
weather during that month.  Manufacturing production 
was little changed, on balance, in May and June, and min-
ing output edged up following a string of steep declines.  
Automakers’ assembly schedules pointed to an increase 
in motor vehicle production during the third quarter, but 
other indicators of manufacturing production, such as 

new orders diffusion indexes from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, suggested only modest gains in 
factory output over the next few months. 

Growth in real personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) appeared to have picked up in the second quarter.  
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its esti-
mate of PCE continued to rise at a solid pace in June.  
Although sales of light motor vehicles declined in June, 
the average pace for the second quarter as a whole was 
essentially the same as in the first quarter.  The apparent 
pickup in real PCE growth was consistent with recent 
readings on key factors that influence consumer spend-
ing, including continued gains in real disposable personal 
income and in households’ net worth.  Also, consumer 
sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers remained reasonably upbeat in 
the second quarter and in early July. 

Recent information on housing activity suggested that 
the pace of the gradual recovery in the sector had slowed 
in recent months.  Starts for new single-family homes 
were little changed, on average, in May and June at a level 
below that in the first quarter, while starts for multifam-
ily units moved up, on net, and were above their first-
quarter average.  Building permit issuance for both  
single-family and multifamily units remained essentially 
flat in the second quarter and pointed to little improve-
ment in the rate of starts over the next few months.  
Sales of new and existing homes both increased, on net, 
in May and June.   

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to have declined for a third 
consecutive quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft decreased in May and 
June, and orders for these goods also declined on bal-
ance.  However, recent readings from national and re-
gional surveys of business conditions suggested some 
pickup in business equipment spending in the near term.  
Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential structures 
excluding drilling and mining declined in May.  The 
number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of 
spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, 
fell through late May but edged up through mid-July. 

Nominal outlays for defense through June pointed to a 
decline in real federal government purchases in the sec-
ond quarter.  Real state and local government purchases 
also appeared to have declined.  Although payrolls for 
state and local governments expanded over the quarter, 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 
 
 

 
 

nominal construction spending by these governments 
declined noticeably in April and May. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May, as 
imports rose and exports declined slightly.  The export 
decline was led by decreased exports of capital goods 
and automotive products.  For imports, increased im-
ports of industrial supplies and consumer goods more 
than offset decreased imports of capital goods.  These 
recent indicators, combined with data from earlier in the 
year, suggested that net exports made a near-neutral con-
tribution to the growth of real GDP in the first half of 
2016.  

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased about 1 percent over the 
12 months ending in May, partly restrained by earlier de-
clines in consumer energy prices.  Core PCE price infla-
tion, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, 
was a little above 1½ percent over the same 12-month 
period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of 
non-energy imports over much of this period and the 
pass-through of the declines in energy prices to the 
prices of other goods and services.  Over the 12 months 
ending in June, total consumer prices as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI) rose 1 percent, while core 
CPI inflation was about 2¼ percent.  The Michigan sur-
vey measure of longer-run inflation expectations edged 
up in June and was unchanged in early July.  Other 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations—includ-
ing those from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and 
Survey of Market Participants—were generally little 
changed, on balance, in recent months. 

The pace of foreign real GDP growth appeared to slow 
in the second quarter, driven in large part by temporary 
factors such as wildfires in Canada and, to a lesser extent, 
by a deceleration of activity in the euro area.  In the 
emerging market economies (EMEs), a pickup in growth 
in China in the second quarter, supported by policy stim-
ulus, appeared to be more than offset by slower growth 
in Latin America.  In the United Kingdom, early indica-
tors following the June 23 referendum on exit from the 
EU (“Brexit”) pointed to a slowdown in economic 
growth.  Inflation in the AFEs picked up in the second 
quarter, largely reflecting some increase in energy prices, 
but generally remained low.  Inflation also remained sub-
dued in the EMEs.  

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial conditions remained accommodative 
over the intermeeting period.  Equity price indexes in-
creased, on net, despite an initial sharp decline following 

the Brexit vote, and corporate bond spreads declined on 
balance.  Conditions in business and consumer credit 
markets were about unchanged.  The expected policy 
path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes 
was little changed, on net, but fluctuated notably over 
the intermeeting period.   

In the days immediately following the Brexit vote, asset 
prices were volatile, and some financial markets, partic-
ularly certain foreign exchange markets, experienced 
brief periods of strained liquidity.  Global stock indexes 
fell notably, credit spreads widened, and safe-haven as-
sets appreciated substantially.  However, broad-based 
market dislocations did not develop, apparently because 
market participants had prepared for a significant risk 
event.  Market analysts also pointed to the communica-
tions and actions by advanced-economy authorities both 
before and after the vote as helping to reassure investors.  
Overall, negative sentiment surrounding the Brexit out-
come early in the intermeeting period was subsequently 
alleviated by expectations for greater policy accommo-
dation in some AFEs, some resolution of near-term po-
litical uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and positive 
U.S. economic data releases.  Nevertheless, several 
longer-term global risks related to Brexit remained.   

Federal Reserve communications released in conjunc-
tion with the June FOMC meeting were interpreted by 
market participants as more accommodative than ex-
pected.  The expected path of the federal funds rate im-
plied by market quotes declined in response to the re-
lease of forecasts collected for the June Summary of 
Economic Projections, which showed larger-than- 
expected downward revisions to projections of the fed-
eral funds rate.  The expected policy path implied by 
market quotes fell further in the aftermath of the Brexit 
vote, but it later retraced most of the earlier declines, 
supported by better-than-expected domestic data re-
leases—particularly the employment and retail sales re-
ports for June—as well as improved sentiment regarding 
the possible near-term implications of Brexit.  The me-
dian respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Deal-
ers and Survey of Market Participants saw one rate hike 
in 2016 as most likely, the same as in the June surveys.  

The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened slightly, on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  Longer-term nominal 
Treasury yields fell sharply in the two weeks following 
the Brexit vote.  Market participants attributed the de-
cline in Treasury yields to a variety of factors, including 
expectations for a more accommodative stance of mon-
etary policy by major central banks; an intensification of 
demand for safe-haven assets immediately following the

Brexit vote; and strong demand by global institutional 
investors for higher-yielding U.S. fixed-income assets 
following decreases in sovereign yields in Europe and 
Japan, in some cases further into negative territory.  
Most of the decline in nominal Treasury yields was re-
versed later in the period.  The small net decline in 
longer-term nominal Treasury yields over the period was 
attributable to a comparable drop in real yields, as 
longer-term inflation compensation measures based on 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation 
swaps were little changed on net.  Spreads of yields on 
agency mortgage-backed securities over yields on Treas-
ury securities narrowed slightly.  

Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the in-
termeeting period.  One-month-ahead option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—fell, return-
ing to the lower end of its distribution of the past few 
years.  U.S. bank stock prices dropped sharply after the 
Brexit vote but then retraced that decrease, buoyed by 
better-than-expected earnings reports from some of the 
largest domestic banks.  Declines in European bank 
stock prices following the Brexit vote also reversed later 
in the intermeeting period.  Spreads of yields on  
investment-grade corporate bonds over those on  
comparable-maturity Treasury securities ended the pe-
riod somewhat lower, on net, and spreads on  
speculative-grade corporate bonds declined notably.  
Near-term forward spreads on speculative-grade issues 
dropped substantially more than their far-term forward 
counterparts, suggesting that the overall decline in  
speculative-grade spreads was due in part to a less nega-
tive credit outlook and not just an increase in investors’ 
risk appetite.  

Overall financing conditions for nonfinancial firms re-
mained accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate 
bonds stayed robust in June, particularly in the  
investment-grade sector.  Issuance slowed significantly 
in early July for both investment- and speculative-grade 
bonds, in part reflecting seasonal factors.  The growth of 
commercial and industrial (C&I) lending on banks’ 
books slowed in June, but expansion of such loans con-
tinued through early July.  This pattern was consistent 
with the responses to the July 2016 Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), in 
which modest net fractions of respondents indicated 
that they had tightened their C&I lending standards and 
experienced weaker demand for such loans during the 
second quarter. 

On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corpora-
tions continued to weaken in recent months, although 

some indicators suggested that the pace of deterioration 
was subsiding.  The net volume of bonds downgraded in 
the second quarter was notably smaller than in the pre-
vious quarter.  Even so, default rates on bonds issued by 
nonfinancial corporations and expected year-ahead de-
fault rates for nonfinancial firms both remained elevated 
relative to the ranges that typically prevail during expan-
sions. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
stayed fairly accommodative, on balance, and bank lend-
ing in all major CRE categories was strong through June.  
Spreads on U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) did not appear to have been affected by the 
Brexit vote.  They remained elevated, however, a factor 
that likely contributed to depressed CMBS issuance so 
far this year.  Meanwhile, CMBS delinquency rates edged 
up for the third consecutive month.  A significant net 
fraction of respondents to the July SLOOS indicated 
that, during the second quarter, they had tightened their 
CRE lending standards for construction and land devel-
opment loans and loans secured by multifamily residen-
tial properties, and a moderate net fraction of respond-
ents reported tightening their lending standards for loans 
secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties.  

Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained 
solid.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds in June was 
strong, credit quality continued to be stable overall, and 
the ratio of yields on general obligation bonds to those 
on comparable-maturity Treasury securities was little 
changed on net.  The default by Puerto Rico and the 
downgrade of the general obligation bonds of Illinois 
both appeared to have only a limited effect on the 
broader municipal bond market.  

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
became more accommodative, on balance, since the 
June FOMC meeting.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-
rate mortgages decreased further, partly reflecting the 
declines in yields on Treasury securities.  A number of 
large banks noted in the July SLOOS an easing of stand-
ards for home-purchase loans eligible for purchase by 
the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  Banks 
also reported a broad-based pickup in demand across 
most major categories of home-purchase loans.  Indica-
tors suggested a pickup in refinancing activity in re-
sponse to the drop in mortgage rates.  

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were 
little changed and remained largely accommodative 
against a backdrop of stable credit performance across 
debt categories.  Growth of auto loans remained robust

even though a modest net fraction of respondents to the 
July SLOOS indicated that they had tightened their 
standards for such loans.  Credit card balances continued 
to grow moderately on balance.  Yield spreads for secu-
rities backed by credit card and auto loans over Treasury 
securities remained largely stable, and market partici-
pants reportedly expected asset-backed security issuance 
to pick up in the coming weeks.  

As in the United States, global financial market develop-
ments during the intermeeting period were driven, in 
large part, by reactions to the U.K. referendum on EU 
membership on June 23 and to the release of U.S. eco-
nomic data.  Immediately after the Brexit vote, the Brit-
ish pound depreciated sharply against other major cur-
rencies, while the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen 
strengthened on what appeared to be safe-haven flows.  
Prices of risky assets and advanced-economy bond yields 
also fell in response to the heightened uncertainty and 
expectations of slower economic growth.  Later in the 
period, however, investors’ concerns eased substantially 
on the resolution of some of the near-term political un-
certainty in the United Kingdom, increased expectations 
for additional policy stimulus in Europe and Japan, and 
U.S. data on employment and retail sales in June that ex-
ceeded market expectations.  Some AFE sovereign 
yields recovered partially from their post-Brexit lows, 
but U.K. long-term yields remained low on expectations 
of slower growth there and further monetary policy ac-
commodation.  Global equity indexes ended higher, on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  However, European 
bank equities, especially those of Italian banks, under-
performed, reflecting investor fears that lower interest 
rates will continue to weigh on profitability.  Emerging 
market asset prices were generally resilient over the in-
termeeting period; the dollar was weaker against most 
emerging market currencies, and flows into emerging 
market assets surged.  Although the Chinese renminbi 
depreciated against both the U.S. dollar and the broader 
currency basket referenced by the Chinese government, 
this development elicited little market reaction.  The un-
successful coup attempt in Turkey on July 15 left little 
imprint on global financial markets. 

In its latest report on potential risks to the stability of the 
U.S. financial system, the staff continued to judge that 
vulnerabilities overall remained at a moderate level and 
noted that the financial system had been resilient to the 
Brexit vote.  While vulnerabilities stemming from  
financial-sector leverage were assessed as still low, those 
from maturity and liquidity transformation were judged 
by the staff to be somewhat higher in the near term than 

in the previous assessment.  Although upcoming regula-
tory changes were expected to improve the stability of 
money market funds in the longer run, the staff noted 
the potential for large withdrawals by investors in antic-
ipation of those changes to lead to some disruptions in 
the short run.  Vulnerabilities emanating from leverage 
in the nonfinancial private sector remained moderate:  
While business debt ratios stayed elevated, household 
debt-to-income ratios continued to inch down.  Valua-
tion pressures also remained at a moderate level.  Al-
though term premiums on Treasury securities became 
more deeply negative and CRE valuation pressures re-
mained appreciable, corporate bond and equity risk pre-
miums were unchanged on net. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the July FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was esti-
mated to have picked up in the second quarter, con-
sistent with the forecast in June.  However, the projected 
step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this 
year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer 
news on construction.  The forecast for real GDP 
growth in 2017 and 2018 was little revised, as the posi-
tive effects of a slightly lower assumed path for interest 
rates and a stronger trajectory for household wealth were 
mostly offset by the restraint from a weaker outlook for 
foreign GDP growth and a slightly stronger path for the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The staff contin-
ued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a mod-
estly faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 
2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer 
spending and, to a lesser degree, by a projected pickup 
in business and residential investment.  The unemploy-
ment rate was expected to remain flat over the second 
half of this year and then to gradually decline through 
the end of 2018.  Over this period, the unemployment 
rate was projected to run somewhat below the staff’s es-
timate of its longer-run natural rate. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation over the 
second half of 2016 was a little lower than in the previ-
ous projection, as recent declines in crude oil prices were 
expected to hold down consumer energy prices.  There-
after, the forecast for inflation was essentially unrevised.  
The staff continued to project that inflation would in-
crease over the next several years, as energy prices and 
the prices of non-energy imports were expected to begin 
steadily rising this year and as resource utilization was 
expected to tighten further.  However, inflation was still 
projected to be slightly below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent in 2018.

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its July projec-
tions for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  
The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted 
to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that 
both monetary and fiscal policy appeared to be better 
positioned to offset large positive shocks than adverse 
ones.  In addition, the staff continued to see the risks to 
the forecast from developments abroad as skewed to the 
downside.  Consistent with the downside risks to aggre-
gate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for 
the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks 
to the projection for inflation were still judged as 
weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that 
longer-term inflation expectations may have edged 
lower. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that the infor-
mation received over the intermeeting period indicated 
that the labor market had strengthened and that eco-
nomic activity had been expanding at a moderate rate.  
Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in 
May.  On balance, payrolls and other labor market indi-
cators pointed to some increase in labor utilization in re-
cent months.  Household spending had been growing 
strongly, but business fixed investment had been soft.  
Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier 
declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-
ports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion remained low; most survey-based measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on 
balance, in recent months.  Domestic and global asset 
prices were volatile early in the intermeeting period fol-
lowing the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU, 
but they subsequently recovered their earlier declines, 
and, on net, U.S. financial conditions eased over the in-
termeeting period. 

Participants generally indicated that their economic fore-
casts had changed little over the intermeeting period.  
They continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
indicators would strengthen.  Inflation was expected to 
remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier 
declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over 
the medium term as the transitory effects of past de-

clines in energy and import prices dissipated and the la-
bor market strengthened further.  Participants viewed 
the near-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook as hav-
ing diminished.  However, some noted that the Brexit 
vote had created uncertainty about the medium- to 
longer-run outlook for foreign economies that could af-
fect economic and financial conditions in the United 
States.  Participants generally agreed that the Committee 
should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators 
and global economic and financial developments. 

Growth in consumer spending was estimated to have re-
bounded in the second quarter from the slow pace in the 
first quarter, as monthly gains in retail sales were strong 
through June.  Sales of new motor vehicles remained at 
a high level, on average, in the second quarter, although 
sales appeared to be supported by substantial incentives 
for consumers and by business fleet purchases.  With the 
second-quarter pickup in spending, real PCE appeared 
to have risen over the first half of the year at a rate con-
sistent with the positive trends in fundamental determi-
nants of household spending.  Participants cited a num-
ber of factors that had likely been supporting household 
spending, including solid real income growth, gains in 
house and equity values, low gasoline prices, and favor-
able levels of consumer confidence. 

Residential investment posted a strong increase in the 
first quarter of the year, but data on starts of new single-
family homes indicated that outlays likely edged down in 
the second quarter.  Data on permit issuance through 
June suggested that new-home building activity might 
rise only slowly in the near term.  However, participants 
commented on a number of factors suggesting that the 
housing sector was likely to continue to improve, albeit 
gradually:  Rising sales of existing homes, responses to 
the July SLOOS pointing to stronger demand for resi-
dential mortgage loans, and the steady increase in house 
prices were seen as evidence of rising demand.  In addi-
tion, credit conditions remained favorable:  Mortgage 
rates had fallen further, and the SLOOS reported easier 
terms for loans eligible for purchase by the GSEs.  
Moreover, several participants noted positive reports on 
residential construction activity from business contacts 
in their Districts, with a few suggesting that shortages of 
lots and skilled labor, rather than low demand, might be 
contributing to the recent slowing. 

Business fixed investment appeared to have declined 
further during the second quarter, with broad-based 
weakness in equipment and another steep drop in drill-
ing and mining structures.  Participants noted that the 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 
 
 

 
 

recent rise in energy prices had spurred an uptick in drill-
ing activity, suggesting that if energy prices firm over 
time as expected, the drag on investment from declining 
energy-sector activity should diminish.  In addition, it 
was pointed out that the upward trend in investment in 
intellectual property products was a positive in the out-
look for investment.  Several participants commented on 
favorable reports from their business contacts on com-
mercial construction.  Based on conversations with their 
contacts, participants discussed a number of factors that 
may have been contributing to businesses’ cautious ap-
proach to investment spending, including concern about 
the likelihood of an extended period of slow economic 
growth, both in the United States and abroad; narrowing 
profit margins; and uncertainty about prospects for gov-
ernment policies. 

In their discussion of business conditions in their Dis-
tricts, many participants reported that their contacts an-
ticipated that the U.K. referendum would have little ef-
fect on their businesses.  Activity in the manufacturing 
sector continued to be mixed:  Several participants indi-
cated that manufacturing in their Districts was still quite 
weak, while several others reported that their Banks’ 
June surveys showed that manufacturing activity had 
picked up or stabilized.  The available surveys indicated 
that service-sector activity continued to expand.  How-
ever, economic activity continued to be depressed in ar-
eas affected by the downturn in the energy sector and 
falling agricultural commodity prices, although several 
participants noted that the recent firming in crude oil 
prices had led to a modest increase in drilling activity.  
Businesses in the energy industry were reported to be 
highly leveraged, and additional restructurings and bank-
ruptcies were seen as likely.  Farm loans continued to 
increase, and banks had seen some rise in delinquencies 
on such credits. 

The labor market report for June appeared to confirm 
participants’ earlier assessments that the small gain in 
payroll employment in May likely had substantially un-
derstated its underlying pace.  The sharp rebound in pay-
roll employment gains put the average monthly increase 
in jobs over the three months ending in June at about 
150,000.  Although this pace was noticeably slower than 
the average rate during 2015 and the first quarter of 
2016, many participants viewed it as consistent with con-
tinued strengthening in labor market conditions and 
with a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate.  
The unemployment rate rose in June after having de-
clined in May, but the labor force participation rate 
ticked up, the rate of involuntary part-time employment 

more than reversed its increase in May, and the broader 
U-6 measure of labor underutilization continued to 
move down.  Some participants noted that recent signs 
of a moderate step-up in wage increases provided further 
evidence of improving labor market conditions.  Al-
though most participants judged that labor market con-
ditions were at or approaching those consistent with 
maximum employment, their views on the implications 
for progress on the Committee’s policy objectives var-
ied.  Some of them believed that a convergence to a 
more moderate, sustainable pace of job gains would 
soon be necessary to prevent an unwanted increase in 
inflationary pressures.  Other participants continued to 
judge that labor utilization remained below that con-
sistent with the Committee’s maximum-employment 
objective.  These participants noted that progress in re-
ducing slack in the labor market had slowed, citing rela-
tively little change, on net, since the beginning of the year 
in the unemployment rate, the number of persons work-
ing part time for economic reasons, the employment-to-
population ratio, labor force participation, or rates of job 
openings and quits. 

Available information on inflation suggested that the 
change in headline PCE prices for the 12 months ending 
in June continued to run well below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective and that the 12-month change in 
core PCE prices likely remained near its May level of 
1.6 percent.  On a 12-month-change basis, core PCE in-
flation had risen from 1.3 percent a year earlier, but it 
continued to be held down by the pass-through of earlier 
declines in energy prices and by soft prices of imports.  
Core PCE inflation over the first half of 2016 was ex-
pected to have been close to an annual rate of 2 percent, 
but it was noted that some of the increase likely reflected 
transitory effects that would be in part reversed during 
the second half of the year.  Longer-run inflation expec-
tations, as reported in the Michigan survey, were little 
changed in June and early July.  The reading from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con-
sumer Expectations for inflation three years ahead 
moved up further in June, returning to near its level of a 
year earlier.  Most market-based measures of longer-run 
inflation compensation remained low. 

Participants also discussed recent developments in fi-
nancial markets and issues related to financial stability.  
The vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU led to 
sharp declines in risk asset prices and a spike in volatility 
in financial markets early in the intermeeting period.  But 
those price moves were subsequently reversed, likely in

response to expectations for policy actions by some ma-
jor central banks, the resolution of some of the political 
uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and better-than- 
expected data on U.S. economic activity.  Financial mar-
kets and institutions were generally resilient in the after-
math of the vote, apparently reflecting in part advance 
preparations by key market participants and communi-
cations from advanced-economy central banks before 
and after the vote that they would take the steps neces-
sary to provide liquidity to support the orderly function-
ing of markets.  Overall, U.S. financial conditions eased 
during the intermeeting period:  Major equity indexes 
rose, longer-term interest rates fell, credit spreads nar-
rowed, and the broad index of the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar was little changed. 

In the discussion of developments related to financial 
stability, it was noted that while the capital and liquidity 
positions of U.S. banks remained strong, European 
banks, particularly Italian banks, were under pressure—
as evidenced by the sharp declines in their equity 
prices—from a weaker economic outlook for that re-
gion, thin interest margins, and concerns about the qual-
ity of their loan portfolios.  In U.S. markets, overall fi-
nancial vulnerabilities were judged to remain moderate, 
as nonfinancial debt had continued to increase roughly 
in line with nominal GDP and valuation pressures were 
not widespread.  However, during the discussion, several 
participants commented on a few developments, includ-
ing potential overvaluation in the market for CRE, the 
elevated level of equity values relative to expected earn-
ings, and the incentives for investors to reach for yield 
in an environment of continued low interest rates.  Re-
garding CRE, it was noted that the recent SLOOS re-
ported that a significant fraction of banks tightened 
lending standards in the first and second quarters of the 
year and that overvaluation did not appear to be wide-
spread across markets.  It was also pointed out that in-
vestors potentially were becoming more comfortable 
locking in current yields in an environment in which low 
interest rates were expected to persist, rather than engag-
ing in the type of speculative behavior that could pose 
financial stability concerns. 

Participants discussed the implications of recent eco-
nomic and financial developments for the economic out-
look and the risks attending the outlook.  They indicated 
that their forecasts for economic growth, the labor mar-
ket, and inflation had changed little over the intermeet-
ing period.  Regarding the near-term outlook, partici-
pants generally agreed that the prompt recovery in finan-
cial markets following the Brexit vote and the pickup in 

job gains in June had alleviated two key uncertainties 
about the outlook that they had faced at the June meet-
ing.  Brexit now appeared likely to have little effect on 
the U.S. economic outlook in the near term.  Moreover, 
the employment report for June, along with other recent 
information that suggested that real GDP rose at a mod-
erate rate in the second quarter, provided some reassur-
ance that a sharp slowdown in employment and eco-
nomic activity was not under way.  Participants judged 
that the incoming information, on the whole, had low-
ered the downside risks to the near-term economic out-
look.  Most participants anticipated that economic 
growth would move up to a rate somewhat above its 
longer-run trend during the second half of 2016 and that 
the labor market would strengthen further.  However, 
several noted that while the outlook for consumer 
spending remained positive, continued weakness in busi-
ness investment and the possibility of slower improve-
ment in the housing sector posed some downside risks 
to their forecasts. 

Although the near-term risks to the outlook associated 
with Brexit had diminished over the intermeeting period, 
participants generally agreed that they should continue 
to closely monitor economic and financial developments 
abroad.  As a consequence of Brexit, economic growth 
in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in the 
euro area would likely be slower than previously antici-
pated.  Moreover, the exit process was expected to entail 
an extended period of negotiations that, in the view of 
most participants, had the potential to increase the po-
litical and economic uncertainties in that region; several 
also saw the possibility that complications during the exit 
process could result in spells of elevated volatility in 
global financial markets.  Some participants noted that 
the weak capital positions and high levels of nonper-
forming loans at some European banks could also weigh 
on economic growth in the region.  In addition to the 
situation in Europe, some participants continued to see 
a number of other downside risks to the medium-term 
economic and financial outlook from abroad, including 
weakness in the global economy more broadly, uncer-
tainty about the outlook for China’s foreign exchange 
policy, and the implications of China’s run-up in debt to 
support its economy.  A few others noted uncertainty 
about the strength of domestic economic activity going 
forward.  However, some other participants indicated 
that they did not view the uncertainties attending the 
outlook to be unusually elevated and continued to see 
the risks to their economic forecasts as balanced.

In discussing the outlook for the labor market, most par-
ticipants viewed some further strengthening in labor 
market indicators as consistent with achieving the Com-
mittee’s maximum-employment objective.  With infla-
tion still below the Committee’s longer-run objective 
and likely to continue to respond only slowly to some-
what tighter labor markets, most also saw relatively low 
risk that a further gradual strengthening of the labor 
market would generate an unwanted increase in infla-
tionary pressures.  Nevertheless, a few participants con-
tinued to caution about the risks to the inflation outlook 
from overshooting the natural rate of unemployment.  
Some indicated that a step-down in monthly job gains 
seemed appropriate as labor market conditions ap-
proached those consistent with the Committee’s  
maximum-employment objective and that a more mod-
erate pace of hiring could still be consistent with further 
increases in labor utilization.  However, several others 
were concerned that if labor market slack diminished 
more slowly than they had previously anticipated, pro-
gress on the Committee’s maximum-employment and 
inflation objectives could be delayed. 

Regarding the outlook for inflation, incoming infor-
mation appeared to be broadly in line with most partici-
pants’ earlier expectations that inflation would gradually 
rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  Most noted that 
the firming in various indicators of core inflation over 
the past year, together with signs that the direct and in-
direct effects of earlier declines in energy prices and 
prices of non-oil imports had begun to fade, provided 
support for their forecasts.  Several added that recent in-
dications of a pickup in wage increases were evidence of 
the effect of tightening resource utilization.  However, 
other participants expressed greater uncertainty about 
the trajectory of inflation.  They saw little evidence that 
inflation was responding much to higher levels of re-
source utilization and suggested that the natural rate of 
unemployment, and the responsiveness of inflation to 
labor market conditions, may be lower than most current 
estimates.  Several viewed the risks to their inflation 
forecasts as weighted to the downside, particularly in 
light of the still-low level of measures of longer-run in-
flation expectations and inflation compensation and the 
likelihood that disinflationary pressures from abroad 
would persist. 

Against the backdrop of their views of the economic 
outlook, participants discussed the conditions that could 
warrant taking another step in removing monetary policy 
accommodation.  With inflation continuing to run below 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, many judged that 

it was appropriate to wait for additional information that 
would allow them to evaluate the underlying momentum 
in economic activity and the labor market and whether 
inflation was continuing to rise gradually to 2 percent as 
expected.  Several suggested that the Committee would 
likely have ample time to react if inflation rose more 
quickly than they currently anticipated, and they pre-
ferred to defer another increase in the federal funds rate 
until they were more confident that inflation was moving 
closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.  In addition, al-
though near-term downside risks to the outlook had di-
minished over the intermeeting period, some partici-
pants stressed that the Committee needed to consider 
the constraints on the conduct of monetary policy asso-
ciated with proximity to the effective lower bound on 
short-term interest rates.  These participants concluded 
that the Committee should wait to take another step in 
removing accommodation until the data on economic 
activity provided a greater level of confidence that eco-
nomic growth was strong enough to withstand a possi-
ble downward shock to demand.  However, some other 
participants viewed recent economic developments as 
indicating that labor market conditions were at or close 
to those consistent with maximum employment and ex-
pected that the recent progress in reaching the Commit-
tee’s inflation objective would continue, even with fur-
ther steps to gradually remove monetary policy accom-
modation.  Given their economic outlook, they judged 
that another increase in the federal funds rate was or 
would soon be warranted, with a couple of them advo-
cating an increase at this meeting. A few participants 
pointed out that various benchmarks for assessing the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy supported taking 
another step in removing policy accommodation.  A few 
also emphasized the risk to the economic expansion that 
would be associated with allowing labor market condi-
tions to tighten to an extent that could lead to an un-
wanted buildup of inflation pressures and thus eventu-
ally require a rapid increase in the federal funds rate.  In 
addition, several expressed concern that an extended pe-
riod of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives 
for investors to reach for yield and could lead to the mis-
allocation of capital and mispricing of risk, with possible 
adverse consequences for financial stability. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in June indicated that the labor 
market had strengthened and that economic activity had 
been expanding at a moderate rate.  They noted that the 
most recent employment report showed that job gains

had been strong in June following weak growth in May, 
and, on balance, payrolls and other labor market indica-
tors pointed to some increase in labor utilization in re-
cent months.  Members agreed that household spending 
had been growing strongly but business fixed investment 
had been soft.  Inflation continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly re-
flecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of 
non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation remained low over the intermeeting 
period, and most survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations were, on balance, little changed. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market indicators would strengthen.  
Members saw developments during the intermeeting pe-
riod as reducing near-term uncertainty along two dimen-
sions discussed at the June meeting.  The first was about 
the outlook for the labor market.  They agreed that the 
strong rebound in job gains in June—together with a rise 
in the labor force participation rate and a decline in the 
number of individuals who were working part time for 
economic reasons—suggested that, despite the very soft 
employment report for May, labor market conditions re-
mained solid and slack had continued to diminish.  Many 
members commented on the somewhat slower average 
pace of improvement in labor market conditions in re-
cent months.  Several of these members observed that 
the recent pace of job gains remained well above that 
consistent with stable rates of labor utilization.  A couple 
of members indicated that, in light of their judgment that 
labor market conditions were at or close to the Commit-
tee’s objectives, some moderation in employment gains 
was to be expected.  In contrast, several other members 
expressed concern about the likelihood of a further re-
duction in the pace of job gains, and it was noted that if 
that slowing turned out to be persistent, the case for in-
creasing the target range for the federal funds rate in the 
near term would be less compelling. 

A second source of near-term uncertainty that members 
had discussed at the June meeting pertained to the po-
tential economic and financial market consequences of 
the U.K. referendum on membership in the EU.  At the 
current meeting, most members pointed to the quick re-
covery of financial market conditions since the “leave” 
vote as an encouraging sign of resilience in global finan-
cial markets that helped reduce near-term uncertainty 
about the outlook for the U.S. economy. 

While members judged that near-term risks to the do-
mestic outlook had diminished, some noted that the 
U.K. vote, along with other developments abroad, still 
imparted significant uncertainty to the medium- to 
longer-term outlook for foreign economies, with possi-
ble consequences for the U.S. outlook.  As a result, 
members agreed to indicate that they would continue to 
closely monitor global economic and financial develop-
ments. 

Members continued to expect inflation to remain low in 
the near term, in part because of earlier declines in en-
ergy prices, but most anticipated that inflation would rise 
to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory ef-
fects of past declines in energy and import prices dissi-
pated and the labor market strengthened further.  None-
theless, in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 
2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward 
the Committee’s inflation goal. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that 
outlook, members decided to maintain the target range 
for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this meet-
ing.  Members generally agreed that, before taking an-
other step in removing monetary accommodation, it was 
prudent to accumulate more data in order to gauge the 
underlying momentum in the labor market and eco-
nomic activity.  A couple of members preferred also to 
wait for more evidence that inflation would rise to 2 per-
cent on a sustained basis.  Some other members antici-
pated that economic conditions would soon warrant tak-
ing another step in removing policy accommodation.  
One member preferred to raise the target range for the 
federal funds rate at the current meeting, citing the eas-
ing of financial conditions since the U.K. referendum, 
the return to trend economic growth, solid job growth, 
and inflation moving toward 2 percent. 

Members again agreed that, in determining the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  
They noted that this assessment would take into account 
a wide range of information, including measures of labor 
market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on financial and in-
ternational developments.  The Committee expected 
that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that 
would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds 
rate, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain,

for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail 
in the longer run.  However, members emphasized that 
the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend 
on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  
In that regard, members judged it appropriate to con-
tinue to leave their policy options open and maintain the 
flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incom-
ing information and its implications for the Committee’s 
assessment of the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, as well as the risks to the out-
look.  Most members noted that effective communica-
tions from the Committee would help the public under-
stand how monetary policy might respond to incoming 
data and developments. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  Members noted 
that this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective July 28, 2016, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse 
repurchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, 
in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such 
operations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-

backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in June indicates that 
the labor market strengthened and that eco-
nomic activity has been expanding at a moder-
ate rate.  Job gains were strong in June following 
weak growth in May.  On balance, payrolls and 
other labor market indicators point to some in-
crease in labor utilization in recent months.  
Household spending has been growing strongly 
but business fixed investment has been soft.  In-
flation has continued to run below the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly re-
flecting earlier declines in energy prices and in 
prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remain low; 
most survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations are little changed, on bal-
ance, in recent months.   

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee currently ex-
pects that, with gradual adjustments in the 
stance of monetary policy, economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
indicators will strengthen.  Inflation is expected 
to remain low in the near term, in part because 
of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 
2 percent over the medium term as the transi-
tory effects of past declines in energy and im-
port prices dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the eco-
nomic outlook have diminished.  The Commit-
tee continues to closely monitor inflation indi-
cators and global economic and financial devel-
opments. 

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative,

thereby supporting further improvement in la-
bor market conditions and a return to 2 percent 
inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  In light of the current shortfall of 
inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress 
toward its inflation goal.  The Committee ex-
pects that economic conditions will evolve in a 
manner that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate 
is likely to remain, for some time, below levels 
that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the federal funds 
rate will depend on the economic outlook as in-
formed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer, 
Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, Eric Rosengren, 
and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  Esther L. George. 

Ms. George dissented because she believed that a 25 ba-
sis point increase in the target range for the federal funds

rate was appropriate at this meeting.  Information avail-
able since the June FOMC meeting showed solid em-
ployment growth, economic growth near its trend, and 
inflation outcomes aligning with the Committee’s objec-
tive.  Domestic financial conditions had eased since the 
U.K. referendum.  She believed that monetary policy 
should respond to these developments by gradually re-
moving accommodation, consistent with the prescrip-
tions of several frameworks for assessing the appropri-
ate stance of monetary policy.  She believed that by wait-
ing longer to adjust the policy stance and deviating from 
the appropriate path to policy normalization, the Com-
mittee risked eroding the credibility of its policy commu-
nications. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors took no action to change the 
interest rates on reserves or discount rates. 

Secretary’s note: The following statement 
regarding the June 14–15, 2016, FOMC meeting 
was inadvertently omitted from minutes of that 
meeting:  “Consistent with the Committee’s 
decision to leave the target range for the federal 
funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors 
took no action to change the interest rates on 
reserves or discount rates.” 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would  be  held  on  Tuesday–Wednesday,  Septem-
ber 20–21, 2016.  The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. 
on July 27, 2016.  

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on July 5, 2016, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on June 14–15, 2016.
