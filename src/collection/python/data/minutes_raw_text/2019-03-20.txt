Balance Sheet Normalization 
Committee participants resumed their discussion from 
the January 2019 meeting on options for transitioning to 
the longer-run size of the balance sheet.  The staff de-
scribed options for ending the reduction in the Federal 
Reserve’s securities holdings at the end of September 
2019 and for potentially reducing the pace of redemp-
tions of Treasury securities before that date.  Reducing 
the pace of redemptions before ending them would be 
consistent with most previous changes in the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet policy and would support a grad-
ual transition to the long-run level of reserves.  It could 
also reinforce the Committee’s communications indicat-
ing that the FOMC was flexible in its plans for balance 
sheet normalization and that the process of balance 
sheet normalization would remain consistent with the at-
tainment of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy ob-
jectives.  However, continuing redemptions at the cur-
rent pace through September might be simpler to com-
municate and would somewhat shorten the transition to 
the long-run level of reserves.  The staff noted that re-
ducing the pace of redemptions before September 
would leave reserves and the balance sheet slightly larger 
than continuing redemptions at the current pace through 
September.  However, the longer-run level of reserves 
and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be deter-
mined by long-term demand for Federal Reserve liabili-
ties.  Staff projections of term premiums and macroeco-
nomic outcomes did not differ substantially across the 
two options. 

The staff also described a possible interim plan for rein-
vesting principal payments received from agency debt 

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) after bal-
ance sheet runoff ends and until the Committee decides 
on the longer-run composition of the System Open Mar-
ket Account (SOMA) portfolio.  Consistent with the 
Committee’s long-standing aim to hold primarily Treas-
ury securities in the longer run, any principal payments 
on agency debt and agency MBS would generally be re-
invested in Treasury securities in the secondary market.  
These reinvestments would be allocated across sectors 
of the Treasury market roughly in proportion to the ma-
turity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.  
However, the plan would maintain the existing $20 bil-
lion per month cap on MBS redemptions; principal pay-
ments on agency debt and agency MBS above $20 billion 
per month would continue to be reinvested in agency 
MBS.  This cap would limit the pace at which the Federal 
Reserve’s agency MBS holdings could decline if prepay-
ments accelerated; the staff projected that the redemp-
tion cap on agency debt and agency MBS was unlikely to 
be reached after 2019. 

The staff noted that, once balance sheet runoff ended, 
the average level of reserves would tend to decline grad-
ually, in line with trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s 
nonreserve liabilities, until the Committee chose to re-
sume growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a 
level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective 
policy implementation. 

Participants judged that ending the runoff of securities 
holdings at the end of September would reduce uncer-
tainty about the Federal Reserve’s plans for its securities 
holdings and would be consistent with the Committee’s 
decision at its January 2019 meeting to continue imple-
menting monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves.  
Participants discussed advantages and disadvantages of 
slowing balance sheet runoff before the September stop-
ping date.  A slowing in the pace of redemptions would 
accord with the Committee’s general practice of adjust-
ing its holdings of securities smoothly and predictably, 
which might reduce the risk that market volatility would 
arise in connection with the conclusion of the runoff of 
securities holdings.  However, these advantages needed 
to be weighed against the additional complexity of a plan 
that would end balance sheet runoff in steps rather than 
all at once.  

Participants reiterated their support for the FOMC’s in-
tention to return to holding primarily Treasury securities 
in the long run.  Participants judged that adopting an in-
terim approach for reinvesting agency debt and agency 
MBS principal payments into Treasury securities across 

a range of maturities was appropriate while the Commit-
tee continued to evaluate potential long-run maturity 
structures for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of Treas-
ury securities.  Many participants offered preliminary 
views on advantages and disadvantages of alternative 
compositions for the SOMA portfolio.  Participants ex-
pected to further discuss the longer-run composition of 
the portfolio at upcoming meetings. 

Participants commented on considerations related to al-
lowing the average level of reserves to decline in line 
with trend growth in nonreserve liabilities for a time af-
ter the end of balance sheet runoff.  Several participants 
preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by re-
suming purchases of Treasury securities relatively soon 
after the end of runoff, because they saw little benefit to 
further declines in reserve balances or because they 
thought the Committee should minimize the risk of in-
terest rate volatility that could occur if the supply of re-
serves dropped below a point consistent with efficient 
and effective implementation of policy.  Some others 
preferred to allow the average level of reserves to con-
tinue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet run-
off ends because such declines could allow the Commit-
tee to learn more about underlying reserve demand, be-
cause they judged that such a process was not likely to 
result in excessive volatility in money market rates, or 
because they judged that moving to lower levels of re-
serves was more consistent with the Committee’s previ-
ous communications indicating that it would hold no 
more securities than necessary for implementing mone-
tary policy efficiently and effectively.  Participants noted 
that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities 
to keep pace with growth in demand for the Federal Re-
serve’s liabilities, whenever it occurred, would be a nor-
mal part of operations to maintain the ample-reserves 
monetary policy implementation regime and would not 
represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.  
Some participants suggested that, at future meetings, the 
Committee should discuss the potential benefits and 
costs of tools that might reduce reserve demand or sup-
port interest rate control.  

Following the discussion, the Chair proposed that the 
Committee communicate its intentions regarding bal-
ance sheet normalization by publishing a statement at 
the conclusion of the meeting.  All participants agreed 
that it was appropriate to issue the proposed statement.

BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION 
PRINCIPLES AND PLANS 

(Adopted March 20, 2019) 

In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the 
progress in normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings and the level of reserves in the bank-
ing system, all participants agreed that it is appropriate at 
this time for the Committee to provide additional infor-
mation regarding its plans for the size of its securities 
holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating 
regime.  At its January meeting, the Committee stated 
that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy 
in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures 
that control over the level of the federal funds rate and 
other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily 
through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s adminis-
tered rates and in which active management of the sup-
ply of reserves is not required.  The Statement Regarding 
Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet 
Normalization released in January as well as the princi-
ples and plans listed below together revise and replace 
the Committee’s earlier Policy Normalization Principles 
and Plans. 

To ensure a smooth transition to the longer-run 
level of reserves consistent with efficient and effec-
tive policy implementation, the Committee intends 
to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over com-
ing quarters provided that the economy and money 
market conditions evolve about as expected. 

o The Committee intends to slow the reduction 
of its holdings of Treasury securities by reduc-
ing the cap on monthly redemptions from the 
current level of $30 billion to $15 billion begin-
ning in May 2019. 

o The Committee intends to conclude the reduc-
tion of its aggregate securities holdings in the 
System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the 
end of September 2019. 

o The Committee intends to continue to allow its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) to decline, consistent 
with the aim of holding primarily Treasury se-
curities in the longer run. 

Beginning in October 2019, principal pay-
ments received from agency debt and 
agency MBS will be reinvested in Treasury 
securities subject to a maximum amount of 

$20 billion per month; any principal pay-
ments in excess of that maximum will con-
tinue to be reinvested in agency MBS. 

Principal payments from agency debt and 
agency MBS below the $20 billion maxi-
mum will initially be invested in Treasury 
securities across a range of maturities to 
roughly match the maturity composition of 
Treasury securities outstanding; the Com-
mittee will revisit this reinvestment plan in 
connection with its deliberations regarding 
the longer-run composition of the SOMA 
portfolio. 

It continues to be the Committee’s view 
that limited sales of agency MBS might be 
warranted in the longer run to reduce or 
eliminate residual holdings.  The timing and 
pace of any sales would be communicated 
to the public well in advance. 

o The average level of reserves after the FOMC 
has concluded the reduction of its aggregate se-
curities holdings at the end of September will 
likely still be somewhat above the level of re-
serves necessary to efficiently and effectively 
implement monetary policy. 

In that case, the Committee currently antic-
ipates that it will likely hold the size of the 
SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a 
time.  During such a period, persistent grad-
ual increases in currency and other non- 
reserve liabilities would be accompanied by 
corresponding gradual declines in reserve 
balances to a level consistent with efficient 
and effective implementation of monetary 
policy. 

o When the Committee judges that reserve bal-
ances have declined to this level, the SOMA 
portfolio will hold no more securities than nec-
essary for efficient and effective policy imple-
mentation.  Once that point is reached, the 
Committee will begin increasing its securities 
holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the 
Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities and 
maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the 
system. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager of the SOMA discussed developments in 
global financial markets over the intermeeting period.  In 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the United States, equity indexes moved higher and 
credit spreads tightened.  Market participants attributed 
these moves largely to a perceived shift in the FOMC’s 
approach to policy following communications stressing 
that the Committee would be patient in assessing the 
need for future adjustments in the target range for the 
federal funds rate and would be flexible on balance sheet 
policy.  

In Europe, measures announced by the European Cen-
tral Bank (ECB) in March, including an extension of for-
ward guidance on interest rates and the announcement 
of another round of targeted long-term refinancing op-
erations, were followed by a decline in euro-area equity 
markets, particularly bank stocks, as well as declines in 
euro-area rates.  Market contacts attributed the price re-
action to a perception that the measures were not as 
stimulative as might have been expected, given down-
ward revisions in the ECB’s growth and inflation fore-
casts.  In China, authorities moved toward an easier fis-
cal and monetary stance; China’s aggregate credit growth 
had rebounded slightly in recent months relative to the 
declining trend observed last year.  The Shanghai Com-
posite index had risen notably since the turn of the year, 
driven in part by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures 
as well as perceived progress on trade negotiations. De-
velopments around Brexit remained a source of market 
uncertainty.  Consistent with ongoing investor uncer-
tainty over the outcome, risk reversals on the pound–
dollar currency pair continued to point to higher de-
mand for protection against pound depreciation relative 
to the dollar. 

The deputy manager provided an overview of money 
market developments and policy implementation over 
the intermeeting period.  The effective federal funds rate 
(EFFR) continued to be very stable at a level equal to the 
interest rate on excess reserves.  Rates in overnight se-
cured markets continued to exhibit some volatility, par-
ticularly on month-end dates.  Market participants at-
tributed some of the volatility in overnight secured rates 
to persistently high net dealer inventories of Treasury se-
curities and to Treasury issuance coinciding with the 
month-end statement dates.  Over the upcoming inter-
meeting period, with the combination of changes in the 
Treasury’s balances at the Federal Reserve and additional 
asset redemptions, reserves were expected to decline to 
a new low of around $1.4 trillion by early May, with some 
notable fluctuations in reserves on days associated with 
tax flows.   

The deputy manager also discussed the transition to a 
long-run regime of ample reserves, following the Com-
mittee’s January announcement that it intends to con-
tinue to implement monetary policy in such a regime.  
Once the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has 
normalized, the Open Market Desk will at some point 
need to conduct open market operations to maintain a 
level of reserves in the banking system that the Commit-
tee deems appropriate.  In doing so, the Desk will need 
to assess banks’ demand for reserves as well as forecast 
other Federal Reserve liabilities and plan operations to 
maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that 
control over short-term interest rates is exercised pri-
marily through the setting of administered rates.  

The deputy manager described a possible operational ap-
proach in an ample-reserves regime based on establish-
ing a minimum operating level that would be a lower 
bound on the daily level of reserves.  The assessment of 
the minimum operating level of reserves would be based 
on a range of information, including surveys of banks 
and market participants, data on banks’ reserve holdings, 
and market monitoring.  Under the proposed approach, 
the Desk would plan open market operations to main-
tain the daily level of reserves above the minimum oper-
ating level.  Consistent with the Committee’s intention 
to maintain a regime that does not require active man-
agement of the supply of reserves, the Desk could plan 
these open market operations over a medium-term hori-
zon.  The average level of reserves over the medium 
term would then be above the minimum operating level, 
providing a buffer of reserves to absorb daily changes in 
nonreserve liabilities.  

Following the manager and deputy manager’s report, 
some participants commented on various aspects of the 
minimum operating level approach.  Decisions regarding 
how far to allow reserves to decline would need to bal-
ance important tradeoffs.  On the one hand, a lower 
minimum operating level might increase the risk of ex-
cessive interest rate volatility.  On the other hand, a 
lower minimum operating level could provide more op-
portunities to learn about underlying reserve demand or 
could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the 
smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and 
effective monetary policy implementation.  However, 
the scope for reducing the level of reserves much further 
after the end of balance sheet runoff might be fairly lim-
ited.   

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  

Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the March 19–20 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, 
although growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) 
appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of 
this year from its solid fourth-quarter pace.  Consumer 
price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), was somewhat below 2 percent in De-
cember, held down in part by recent declines in con-
sumer energy prices, while PCE price inflation for items 
other than food and energy was close to 2 percent; more 
recent readings on PCE price inflation were delayed by 
the earlier federal government shutdown.  Survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance. 

Increases in total nonfarm payroll employment re-
mained solid, on average, in recent months; employment 
rose only a little in February but had expanded strongly 
in January.  The national unemployment rate edged 
down, on net, over the past two months to 3.8 percent 
in February, and both the labor force participation rate 
and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly on 
balance.  The unemployment rates for African Ameri-
cans, Asians, and Hispanics in February were at or below 
their levels at the end of the previous economic expan-
sion, though persistent differentials in unemployment 
rates across groups remained.  The share of workers em-
ployed part time for economic reasons moved down in 
February and was below the lows reached in late 2007.  
The rate of private-sector job openings in January was 
the same as its fourth-quarter average and remained ele-
vated, while the rate of quits edged up in January; the 
four-week moving average of initial claims for unem-
ployment insurance benefits through early March was 
still near historically low levels.  Average hourly earnings 
for all employees rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months 
ending in February, a significantly faster pace than a year 
earlier.  The employment cost index for private-sector 
workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending 
in December, somewhat faster than a year earlier.  Total 
labor compensation per hour in the business sector in-
creased 2.9 percent over the four quarters of 2018, about 
the same rate as a year earlier. 

Industrial production declined in January and rebounded 
only somewhat in February.  Moreover, manufacturing 
output decreased over both months, as production in 

the motor vehicle and parts sector contracted notably in 
January and declines were more broad based in Febru-
ary.  Production in the mining and utilities sectors ex-
panded, on net, over the past two months.  Automakers’ 
assembly schedules suggested that the production of 
light motor vehicles would be roughly flat in the near 
term, and new orders indexes from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys pointed to only modest gains in 
overall factory output in the coming months. 

Household spending looked to be slowing around the 
turn of the year.  Real PCE decreased markedly in De-
cember after a solid increase in the previous month, and 
the components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate 
PCE rebounded only partially in January.  Key factors 
that influence consumer spending—including a low un-
employment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensa-
tion, and still elevated measures of households’ net 
worth—were supportive of a pickup in consumer 
spending to a solid pace in the near term.  In addition, 
consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, stepped up in February 
and early March to an upbeat level. 

Real residential investment appeared to be softening fur-
ther in the first quarter, likely reflecting, in part, de-
creases in the affordability of housing arising from both 
the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past 
year and ongoing house price appreciation.  Starts of 
new single-family homes increased slightly, on net, over 
December and January, while starts of multifamily units 
declined.  Building permit issuance for new single-family 
homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the un-
derlying trend in construction of such homes—moved 
down over those two months.  In addition, sales of both 
new and existing homes decreased in January.  

Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property looked to be slowing in 
the first quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense cap-
ital goods excluding aircraft rose in December and Jan-
uary, while available indicators pointed to a decrease in 
transportation equipment spending in the first quarter 
after a strong fourth-quarter gain.  Forward-looking in-
dicators of business equipment spending—such as or-
ders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and 
readings on business sentiment—pointed to sluggish in-
creases in the near term.  Nominal business expenditures 
for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and 
mining sector increased in December and January.  In 
addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



operation—an indicator of business spending for struc-
tures in the drilling and mining sector—expanded, on 
balance, in February and through the middle of March. 

Total real government purchases appeared to be moving 
sideways in the first quarter.  Relatively strong increases 
in real federal defense purchases were likely to be 
roughly offset by an expected decline in real nondefense 
purchases stemming from the effects of the partial fed-
eral government shutdown.  Real purchases by state and 
local governments looked to be rising modestly in the 
first quarter, as the payrolls of those governments ex-
panded a bit in January and February, and nominal state 
and local construction spending rose, on net, in Decem-
ber and January. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in 
November before widening in December to the largest 
deficit since 2008.  Exports declined in November and 
December, as exports of industrial supplies and automo-
tive products fell in both months.  Imports decreased in 
November before partially recovering in December, 
with imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies 
driving this swing.  The BEA estimated that the change 
in net exports was a drag of about ¼ percentage point 
on the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months 
ending in December, slightly slower than a year earlier, 
as consumer energy prices declined a little and consumer 
food prices rose only modestly.  Core PCE price infla-
tion, which excludes changes in consumer food and en-
ergy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period, some-
what higher than a year earlier.  The consumer price in-
dex (CPI) rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in 
February, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent.  Re-
cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations—including those from the Michi-
gan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the 
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market 
Participants—were little changed on balance. 

Economic growth in foreign economies slowed further 
in the fourth quarter.  This development reflected slow-
ing in the Canadian economy and some emerging market 
economies (EMEs), including Brazil and Mexico, along 
with continued economic weakness in the euro area and 
China.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), re-
cent data suggested that economic activity, especially in 
the manufacturing sector, remained subdued in the first 
quarter of this year.  Economic activity also remained 
weak in many EMEs, particularly in Mexico and emerg-
ing Asia excluding China, although some data pointed to 

a modest pickup in China.  Inflation in foreign econo-
mies slowed further early this year, partly reflecting 
lower retail energy prices across both AFEs and EMEs.  

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investor sentiment toward risky assets continued to im-
prove over the intermeeting period.  Market participants 
cited accommodative monetary policy communications 
and optimism for a trade deal between the United States 
and China as factors that contributed to the improve-
ment.  Broad equity price indexes increased notably, cor-
porate bond spreads narrowed, and measures of equity 
market volatility declined.  Meanwhile, financing condi-
tions for businesses and households improved slightly 
and generally remained supportive of economic activity.   

FOMC communications issued following the January 
meeting were generally viewed by market participants as 
more accommodative than expected.  Subsequent com-
munications—including the minutes of the January 
FOMC meeting, the Chair’s semiannual testimony to the 
Congress, and speeches by FOMC participants—were 
interpreted as reflecting a patient approach to monetary 
policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction by the end of 
this year.  The market-implied path for the federal funds 
rate in 2019 declined slightly over the period, while in-
vestors continued to expect no change to the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the March FOMC 
meeting.  The market-implied path of the federal funds 
rate for 2020 and 2021 shifted down a little. 

Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined a bit 
across the Treasury yield curve over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Communications from FOMC participants that 
were more accommodative than expected amid muted 
readings on inflation, communications from other major 
central banks that, on balance, were also regarded as 
more accommodative than expected, and generally 
mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to 
the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sen-
timent.  The spread between the yields on nominal  
10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed over 
the period and remained in the lower end of its historical 
range of recent decades.  Measures of inflation compen-
sation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Secu-
rities increased modestly, on net, although they remained 
below levels seen last fall. 

Major U.S. equity price indexes increased over the inter-
meeting period, with broad-based gains across sectors.  
Improved prospects for a trade deal between the United 
States and China and accommodative monetary policy 
were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker-

than-expected announcements of corporate earnings for 
the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 
2019.  Consistent with reports about a potential trade 
deal, stock prices of firms with greater exposure to China 
generally outperformed the S&P 500 index.  Option- 
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-
month horizon—the VIX—declined and reached its 
lowest point this year.  Spreads on investment- and spec-
ulative-grade corporate bonds narrowed, consistent with 
the gains in equity prices, but were still wider than levels 
observed last fall.   

Conditions in short-term funding markets generally re-
mained stable over the intermeeting period.  The EFFR 
was consistently equal to the rate of interest on excess 
reserves, while take-up in the overnight reverse repur-
chase agreement facility remained low.  Yield spreads on 
commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit 
generally narrowed further from their elevated year-end 
levels, likely reflecting an increase in investor demand for 
short-term financial assets.  Meanwhile, the statutory 
federal government debt ceiling was reestablished at 
$22 trillion on March 1. 

The prices of foreign risky assets broadly tracked the 
positive moves in similar U.S. assets over the intermeet-
ing period.  Communications by major central banks, 
which were, on net, more accommodative than ex-
pected, along with optimism regarding trade negotia-
tions between the United States and China, contributed 
to the upward price moves and more than offset the ef-
fects of continued concerns about foreign economic 
growth.  In particular, global equity prices generally 
ended the period higher, and dedicated emerging market 
funds continued to see inflows.  At the same time, long-
term AFE yields declined somewhat, on net, on commu-
nications from major foreign central banks and inves-
tors’ concerns about foreign economic growth.   

The broad dollar index appreciated slightly as the exten-
sion of accommodative policies and revised guidance by 
major foreign central banks weighed on AFE currencies.  
An exception was the British pound, which strengthened 
a bit against the dollar, as market participants viewed re-
cent Parliamentary votes as reducing the likelihood of a 
no-deal Brexit.  

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses contin-
ued to be accommodative overall.  Gross issuance of 
both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds 
was strong in January and February, recovering from the 
low levels observed late last year.  Issuance in the insti-
tutional syndicated leveraged loan market also recovered 
in the first two months of the year, as new issuance in 

February was in line with average monthly new issuance 
in 2018, and spreads narrowed somewhat from their De-
cember levels.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corpo-
rations continued to show signs of deterioration, al-
though actual defaults remained low overall.  Commer-
cial and industrial lending showed continued strength in 
January and February.  Small business credit market con-
ditions were little changed, and credit conditions in mu-
nicipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net.   

Private-sector analysts revised down their projections 
for 2019 and year-ahead corporate earnings a bit.  The 
pace of gross equity issuance was sluggish in January but 
ticked up in February, consistent with the uptick in the 
stock market.      

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions continued to be generally accommodative.  
Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
spreads declined over the intermeeting period, with  
triple-B spreads moving down to near their late- 
November levels.  Issuance of non-agency CMBS re-
mained strong through February, and CRE lending by 
banks grew at a strong pace in February following rela-
tively sluggish growth in January.  

Residential mortgage financing conditions remained ac-
commodative on balance.  Purchase mortgage origina-
tion activity was flat in December but edged up in Janu-
ary, as mortgage rates remained lower than the peak 
reached last November.   

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were 
little changed in recent months and remained generally 
supportive of household spending.  Credit card loan 
growth remained strong through December, though the 
pace slowed during 2018 amid tighter lending standards 
by commercial banks.  Auto loan growth remained 
steady through the end of 2018. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the March FOMC meeting was revised down a little on 
balance.  This revision reflected the effects of weaker-
than-expected incoming data on both aggregate domes-
tic spending and foreign economic growth that were 
only partially offset by a somewhat higher projected path 
for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajec-
tory for interest rates.  The staff forecast that U.S. real 
GDP growth would slow markedly in the first quarter, 
reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer 
spending and business investment.  But the staff judged 
that the first-quarter slowdown would be transitory and 
that real GDP growth would bounce back solidly in the 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



second quarter.  In the medium-term projection, real 
GDP growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the 
staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 
2020—a somewhat lower trajectory, on net, for real 
GDP than in the previous projection—and then slow to 
a pace below potential output growth in 2021.  The staff 
revised up slightly its assumed underlying trend in the 
labor force participation rate, raising the level of poten-
tial output a bit, which contributed—along with the 
lower projected path for real GDP—to an assessment 
that resource utilization was a little less tight than in the 
previous forecast.  The unemployment rate was pro-
jected to decline a little further below the staff’s estimate 
of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the 
end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021.  With labor 
market conditions judged to still be tight, the staff con-
tinued to assume that projected employment gains 
would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pres-
sure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual 
upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.   

The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down 
slightly for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting some 
recent softer-than-expected readings on consumer 
prices.  Core PCE price inflation was expected to remain 
at 1.9 percent over this year as a whole and then to edge 
up to 2 percent for the remainder of the medium term.  
Total PCE price inflation was forecast to run a bit below 
core inflation over the next three years, reflecting pro-
jected declines in energy prices.   

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as generally similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for 
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly 
balanced.  On the upside, household spending and busi-
ness investment could expand faster than the staff pro-
jected, supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 
2017, still strong overall labor market conditions, and 
upbeat consumer sentiment.  In addition, financial con-
ditions might not tighten as much as assumed in the staff 
forecast.  On the downside, the recent softening in a 
number of economic indicators could be the harbinger 
of a substantial deterioration in economic activity.  
Moreover, trade policies and foreign economic develop-
ments could move in directions that have significant 
negative effects on U.S. economic growth.  Risks to the 
inflation projection also were seen as balanced.  The up-
side risk that inflation could increase more than expected 
in an economy that is still projected to be operating no-
tably above potential for an extended period was coun-

terbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term infla-
tion expectations may be lower than was assumed in the 
staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar 
could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deterio-
rated. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these 
minutes. 

Participants agreed that information received since the 
January meeting indicated that the labor market had re-
mained strong but that growth of economic activity had 
slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.  Payroll 
employment was little changed in February, but job 
gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and 
the unemployment rate had remained low.  Recent indi-
cators pointed to slower growth of household spending 
and business fixed investment in the first quarter.  On a 
12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as 
a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other 
than food and energy remained near 2 percent.  On bal-
ance, market-based measures of inflation compensation 
had remained low in recent months, and survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed. 

Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few 
years.  Underlying economic fundamentals continued to 
support sustained expansion, and most participants in-
dicated that they did not expect the recent weakness in 
spending to persist beyond the first quarter.  Neverthe-
less, participants generally expected the growth rate of 
real GDP this year to step down from the pace seen over 
2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of 
longer-run growth.  Participants cited various factors as 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



likely to contribute to the step-down, including slower 
foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus.  A 
number of participants judged that economic growth in 
the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent 
couple of years would likely be a little lower, on balance, 
than they had previously forecast.  Reasons cited for 
these downward revisions included disappointing news 
on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy 
than had previously been anticipated. 

In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
noted that softness in consumer spending had contrib-
uted importantly to the projected slowing in economic 
growth in the current quarter.  Many participants 
pointed to the weakness in retail sales in December as 
notable, although they recognized that the data for Jan-
uary had shown a partial recovery in retail sales.  Partici-
pants also observed that much of the recent softness 
likely reflected temporary factors, such as the partial fed-
eral government shutdown and December’s volatility in 
financial markets, and that consumer sentiment had re-
covered after these factors had receded.  Consequently, 
many participants expected consumer spending to pro-
ceed at a stronger pace in coming months, supported by 
favorable underlying factors, including a strong labor 
market, solid growth in household incomes, improve-
ments in financial conditions and in households’ balance 
sheet positions, and upbeat consumer sentiment.  Par-
ticipants noted, however, that the continued softness in 
the housing sector was a concern. 

Participants also commented on the apparent slowing of 
growth in business fixed investment in the first quarter.  
Factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in in-
vestment growth included downward revisions in fore-
casts of corporate earnings; relatively low energy prices 
that provided less incentive for new drilling and explo-
ration; flattening capital goods orders; reports from con-
tacts of softer export sales and of weaker economic ac-
tivity abroad; elevated levels of uncertainty about gov-
ernment policies, including trade policies; and the likely 
effect of recent financial market volatility on business 
sentiment.  However, many participants pointed to signs 
that the weakness in investment would likely abate.  
Some contacts in manufacturing and other sectors re-
ported that business conditions were favorable, with 
strong demand for labor, business sentiment had recov-
ered from its recent decline, and recent reductions in 
mortgage interest rates would provide some support for 
construction activity.  Agricultural activity remained 
weak in various areas of the country, with the weakness 

in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on com-
modity prices.  Recent widespread severe flooding had 
also adversely affected the agricultural sector. 

Participants noted that the latest readings on overall in-
flation had been somewhat softer than expected.  How-
ever, participants observed that these readings largely re-
flected the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices 
and that core inflation remained near 2 percent.  Most 
participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, 
expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat 
and to be at or near the Committee’s longer-run objec-
tive of 2 percent over the next few years.  Many partici-
pants indicated that, while inflation had been close to 
2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that it had not 
shown greater signs of firming in response to strong la-
bor market conditions and rising nominal wage growth, 
as well as to the short-term upward pressure on prices 
arising from tariff increases.  Low rates of price increases 
in sectors of the economy that were not cyclically sensi-
tive were cited by a couple of participants as one reason 
for the recent easing in inflation.  A few participants ob-
served that the pickup in productivity growth last year 
was a welcome development helping to bolster potential 
output and damp inflationary pressures. 

In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta-
tions, participants noted that market-based measures of 
inflation compensation had risen modestly over the in-
termeeting period, although they remained low.  A cou-
ple of participants stressed that recent readings on sur-
vey measures of inflation expectations were also still at 
low levels.  Several participants suggested that longer-
term inflation expectations could be at levels somewhat 
below those consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective and that this might make it more dif-
ficult to achieve that objective on a sustained basis. 

In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited 
evidence that conditions remained strong, including the 
very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the 
labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, 
near-record levels of job openings and help-wanted 
postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent 
months.  Participants observed that, following strong 
job gains in January, there had been little growth in pay-
rolls in February, although a few participants pointed out 
that the February reading had likely been affected by ad-
verse weather conditions.  A couple of participants 
noted that, over the medium term, some easing in pay-
roll growth was to be expected as economic growth 
slowed to its longer-run trend rate.  Reports from busi-
ness contacts predominantly pointed to continued 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



strong labor demand, with firms offering both higher 
wages and more nonwage benefits to attract workers.  
Economy-wide wage growth was seen as being broadly 
consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth 
and with inflation of 2 percent.  A few participants cited 
the combination of muted inflation pressures and ex-
panding employment as a possible indication that some 
slack remained in the labor market. 

Participants commented on a number of risks associated 
with their outlook for economic activity.  A few partici-
pants noted that there remained a high level of uncer-
tainty associated with international developments, in-
cluding ongoing trade talks and Brexit deliberations, al-
though a couple of participants remarked that the risks 
of adverse outcomes were somewhat lower than in Jan-
uary.  Other downside risks included the possibility of 
sizable spillovers from a greater-than-expected eco-
nomic slowdown in Europe and China, persistence of 
the softness in spending, or a sharp falloff in fiscal stim-
ulus.  A few participants observed that an economic de-
terioration in the United States, if it occurred, might be 
amplified by significant debt service burdens for many 
firms.  Participants also mentioned a number of upside 
risks regarding the outlook for economic activity, includ-
ing outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty 
were resolved favorably, consumer and business senti-
ment rebounded sharply, or the recent strengthening in 
labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the un-
derlying trend.  Upside risks to the outlook for inflation 
included the possibility that wage pressures could rise 
unexpectedly and lead to greater-than-expected price in-
creases. 

In their discussion of financial developments, partici-
pants observed that a good deal of the tightening over 
the latter part of last year in financial conditions had 
since been reversed; Federal Reserve communications 
since the beginning of this year were seen as an im-
portant contributor to the recent improvements in fi-
nancial conditions.  Participants noted that asset valua-
tions had recovered strongly and also discussed the de-
cline that had occurred in recent months in yields on 
longer-term Treasury securities.  Several participants ex-
pressed concern that the yield curve for Treasury securi-
ties was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence 
suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend 
economic weakness; however, their discussion also 
noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in 
longer-term interest rates made historical relationships a 
less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the 
recent behavior of the yield curve.  Several participants 

pointed to the increased debt issuance and higher lever-
age of nonfinancial corporations as a development that 
warranted continued monitoring. 

In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at the 
current meeting, participants agreed that it would be ap-
propriate to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent.  Participants 
judged that the labor market remained strong, but that 
information received over the intermeeting period, in-
cluding recent readings on household spending and 
business fixed investment, pointed to slower economic 
growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth 
quarter of 2018.  Despite these indications of softer first-
quarter growth, participants generally expected eco-
nomic activity to continue to expand, labor markets to 
remain strong, and inflation to remain near 2 percent.  
Participants also noted significant uncertainties sur-
rounding their economic outlooks, including those re-
lated to global economic and financial developments.  In 
light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence 
of muted inflation pressures, participants generally 
agreed that a patient approach to determining future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
remained appropriate.  Several participants observed 
that the characterization of the Committee’s approach to 
monetary policy as “patient” would need to be reviewed 
regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties sur-
rounding the outlook evolve.  A couple of participants 
noted that the “patient” characterization should not be 
seen as limiting the Committee’s options for making pol-
icy adjustments when they are deemed appropriate.   

With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting, a majority of participants expected that the 
evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out-
look would likely warrant leaving the target range un-
changed for the remainder of the year.  Several of these 
participants noted that the current target range for the 
federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its 
longer-run neutral level and foresaw economic growth 
continuing near its longer-run trend rate over the fore-
cast period.  Participants continued to emphasize that 
their decisions about the appropriate target range for the 
federal funds rate at coming meetings would depend on 
their ongoing assessments of the economic outlook, as 
informed by a wide range of data, as well as on how the 
risks to the outlook evolved.  Several participants noted 
that their views of the appropriate target range for the 
federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on 
incoming data and other developments.  Some partici-
pants indicated that if the economy evolved as they cur-
rently expected, with economic growth above its longer-

Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________



run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to 
raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly 
later this year.   

Several participants expressed concerns that the public 
had, at times, misinterpreted the medians of participants’ 
assessments of the appropriate level for the federal 
funds rate presented in the SEP as representing the con-
sensus view of the Committee or as suggesting that pol-
icy was on a preset course.  Such misinterpretations 
could complicate the Committee’s communications re-
garding its view of appropriate monetary policy, particu-
larly in circumstances when the future course of policy 
is unusually uncertain.  Nonetheless, several participants 
noted that the policy rate projections in the SEP are a 
valuable component of the overall information provided 
about the monetary policy outlook.  The Chair noted 
that he had asked the subcommittee on communications 
to consider ways to improve the information contained 
in the SEP and to improve communications regarding 
the role of the federal funds rate projections in the SEP 
as part of the policy process.    

Participants also discussed alternative interpretations of 
subdued inflation pressures in current economic circum-
stances and the associated policy implications.  Several 
participants observed that limited inflationary pressures 
during a period of historically low unemployment could 
be a sign that low inflation expectations were exerting 
downward pressure on inflation relative to the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent inflation target; in addition, subdued in-
flation pressures could indicate a less tight labor market 
than suggested by common measures of resource utili-
zation.  Consistent with these observations, several par-
ticipants noted that various indicators of inflation expec-
tations had remained at the lower end of their historical 
range, and a few participants commented that they had 
recently revised down their estimates of the longer-run 
unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation.  
In light of these considerations, some participants noted 
that the appropriate response of the federal funds rate to 
signs of labor market tightening could be modest pro-
vided that signs of inflation pressures continued to be 
limited.  Some participants regarded their judgments that 
the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat 
trajectory as reflecting other factors, such as low esti-
mates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate or risk-
management considerations.  A few participants ob-
served that the appropriate path for policy, insofar as it 
implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time, 
could lead to greater financial stability risks.  However, a 
couple of these participants noted that such financial sta-
bility risks could be addressed through appropriate use 

of countercyclical macroprudential policy tools or other 
supervisory or regulatory tools.   

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in January indicated that the 
labor market remained strong but that growth of eco-
nomic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the 
fourth quarter.  Payroll employment was little changed 
in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate had re-
mained low.  Recent indicators pointed to slower growth 
of household spending and business fixed investment in 
the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation 
had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; 
inflation for items other than food and energy remained 
near 2 percent.  On balance, market-based measures of 
inflation compensation had remained low in recent 
months, and survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flations expectations were little changed. 

In their consideration of the economic outlook, mem-
bers noted that financial conditions had improved since 
the beginning of year, but that some time would be 
needed to assess whether indications of weak economic 
growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent 
quarters.  Members also noted that inflationary pressures 
remained muted and that a number of uncertainties 
bearing on the U.S. and global economic outlook still 
awaited resolution.  However, members continued to 
view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong 
labor market conditions, and inflation near the Commit-
tee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely 
outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead.  In 
light of global economic and financial developments and 
muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the 
Committee could be patient as it determined what future 
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
may be appropriate to support those outcomes. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent.  Members agreed that 
in determining the timing and size of future adjustments 
to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com-
mittee would assess realized and expected economic 
conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum- 
employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objec-
tives.  They reiterated that this assessment would take 
into account a wide range of information, including 

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla-
tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings 
on financial and international developments.  More gen-
erally, members noted that decisions regarding near-
term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy 
would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution 
of the outlook as informed by incoming data. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to characterize the labor market as remaining 
strong.  While payroll employment had been little 
changed in February, job gains had been solid, on aver-
age, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had 
remained low.  Members also agreed to note that growth 
in economic activity appeared to have slowed from its 
solid rate in the fourth quarter, consistent with recent 
indicators of household spending and business fixed in-
vestment.  The description of overall inflation was re-
vised to recognize that inflation had declined, largely as 
a result of lower energy prices, while still noting that in-
flation for items other than food and energy remained 
near 2 percent. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective March 21, 2019, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re-
verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-
chase operations with maturities of more than 
one day when necessary to accommodate week-
end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at 
an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim-
ited only by the value of Treasury securities held 
outright in the System Open Market Account 
that are available for such operations and by a 
per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during each cal-
endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to 
continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-
backed securities the amount of principal pay-
ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 

agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities received during each calendar month that 
exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from 
these amounts for operational reasons are ac-
ceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in January indicates that 
the labor market remains strong but that growth 
of economic activity has slowed from its solid 
rate in the fourth quarter.  Payroll employment 
was little changed in February, but job gains 
have been solid, on average, in recent months, 
and the unemployment rate has remained low.  
Recent indicators point to slower growth of 
household spending and business fixed invest-
ment in the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, 
overall inflation has declined, largely as a result 
of lower energy prices; inflation for items other 
than food and energy remains near 2 percent.  
On balance, market-based measures of inflation 
compensation have remained low in recent 
months, and survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations are little changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  In support of these goals, 
the Committee decided to maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 
2½ percent.  The Committee continues to view 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of 
global economic and financial developments 
and muted inflation pressures, the Committee 
will be patient as it determines what future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate may be appropriate to support these 
outcomes. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized

and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James 
Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. 
George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 19–20, 2019, meet-
ing participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each 
year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run.  Each 
participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-
isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability. 

Participants who submitted longer-run projections gen-
erally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat 
above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate.  
Most participants continued to expect real GDP growth 
to edge down over the projection horizon, with almost 
all participants projecting growth in 2021 to be at or be-
low their estimates of its longer-run rate.  All participants 
who submitted longer-run projections continued to ex-
pect that the unemployment rate would run at or below 
their estimates of its longer-run level through 2021.  Al-
most all participants projected that inflation, as meas-
ured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
would increase slightly over the next two years, and most 
participants expected that it would be at or slightly above 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021.  
Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) from December 2018, all participants marked 
down somewhat their projections for real GDP growth 
in 2019, and most revised down slightly their projections 
for total inflation in 2019.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide 
summary statistics for the projections. 

1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate. 

As shown in figure 2, most participants expected that 
the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives 
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would 
likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current 
level through the end of 2019.  The medians of partici-
pants’ assessments of the appropriate level of the federal 
funds rate in 2020 and 2021 were close to the median 
assessment of its longer-run level.  Compared with the 
December submissions, the median projections for the 
federal funds rate for the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 
were 50 basis points lower. 

A substantial majority of participants continued to view 
the uncertainty around their projections as broadly sim-
ilar to the average of the past 20 years.  While a majority 
of participants viewed the risks to the outlook as bal-
anced, a couple more participants than in December 
viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projec-
tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi-
tional on their individual assessments of appropriate 
monetary policy, was 2.1 percent.  Most participants 
continued to expect GDP growth to slow throughout 
the projection horizon, with the median projection at 
1.9 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021, a touch 
lower than the median estimate of its longer-run rate of 
1.9 percent.  Relative to the December SEP, the medians 
of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 
were 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point 
lower, respectively.  Most participants mentioned a re-
cent patch of weaker data on domestic economic activ-
ity, and some pointed to a softer global growth outlook, 
as factors behind the downward revisions to their near-
term growth estimates. 

The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, about ½ per-
centage point below the median assessment of its longer-
run level.  The median projections for 2020 and 2021 
were 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.  These 
median unemployment rates were a little higher than 
those from the December SEP.  Nevertheless, most par-
ticipants continued to project that the unemployment 
rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longer-
run level.  The median estimate of the longer-run rate of

unemployment was 4.3 percent, which was slightly lower 
than in December. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP 
growth for 2019 shifted down relative to that in the De-
cember SEP, while the distributions for 2020, 2021, and 
the longer-run rate of GDP growth changed only 
slightly.  The distributions of individual projections for 
the unemployment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved mod-
estly higher relative to those in December, and the dis-
tribution in 2021 edged higher as well.  Meanwhile, the 
distribution for the longer-run unemployment rate 
shifted down a touch. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
As shown in table 1, the medians of projections for total 
PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent in 2019 and 
2.0 percent in both 2020 and 2021, each a touch lower 
than in the December SEP.  The medians of projections 
for core PCE price inflation over the 2019–21 period 
were 2.0 percent, the same as in December. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of projections for total PCE 
price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019, 
2020, and 2021 shifted down slightly from the Decem-
ber SEP.  Almost all participants expected that total and 
core PCE price inflation would be between 1.8 and 
2.2 percent throughout the projection horizon. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of 
each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run.  
The distributions for 2019 through 2021 shifted toward 
lower values.  Compared with the projections prepared 
for the December SEP, the median federal funds rate 
was 50 basis points lower each year over the 2019–21 
period.  At the end of 2019, the median of federal funds 
rate projections was 2.38 percent, consistent with no rate 
increases over the course of 2019.  Thereafter, the medi-
ans of the projections were 2.63 percent at the end of 
both 2020 and 2021, slightly lower than the median of 
the longer-run projections of the federal funds rate of 
2.75 percent.  Muted inflationary pressures and risk- 
management considerations were both cited as factors 
contributing to the downward revisions in participants’ 
assessments of the appropriate path for the policy rate.  
The distribution of individual projections for the longer-
run federal funds rate ticked down from December.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root 

mean squared error of projections for 1999 through 2018 that were re-
leased in the spring by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His-
torical Forecasting Errors:  The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance 
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth 
quarter basis. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the 
fourth quarter. 

 
Uncertainty and Risks 
In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of 
possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those 
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government forecasts over the past 
20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and total PCE price inflation.  Those measures are 
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the 
top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts 
display the SEP medians for the three variables sur-
rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived 
from the forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the de-
gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar 
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the 
risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then 
future outcomes of these variables would have about a 
70 percent probability of being within these confidence 
intervals.  For all three variables, this measure of uncer-
tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore-
cast horizon lengthens. 

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  A substantial majority of participants continued to

view the degree of uncertainty attached to their eco-
nomic projections for real GDP growth, unemployment, 
and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 
20 years.2 

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their current economic 
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  A majority of participants judged 
the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as 
broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent 
with a symmetric fan chart.  The balance of risks to the 
projection for real GDP growth shifted a bit lower, with 
four participants assessing the risks as weighted to the 
downside and no participant seeing it weighted to the 
upside.  The balance of risks to the projection for the 
unemployment rate moved a touch higher, with three 
participants judging the risks to the unemployment rate 
as weighted to the upside and two participants viewing 
the risks as weighted to the downside.  In addition, the 
balance of risks to the inflation projections shifted down 
slightly relative to December.  Two more participants 
than in December saw the risks to the inflation projec-
tions as weighted to the downside, and no participant 
judged the risks as weighted to the upside. 

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, trade tensions as well as develop-

rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach 

ments abroad were mentioned by participants as sources 
of uncertainty or downside risk to the economic growth 
outlook.  For the inflation outlook, the effect of trade 
restrictions was cited as an upside risk, while the concern 
that inflation expectations could be drifting below the 
FOMC’s objective and the potential for a stronger dollar 
and weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure 
on inflation were viewed as downside risks.  A number 
of participants mentioned that their assessments of risks 
remained roughly balanced in part as a result of their 
downward revisions to the appropriate federal funds rate 
path. 

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal 
funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-
opments over time in key economic variables such as 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, 
uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed-
eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties 
about the paths for these economic variables along with 
other factors.  Figure 5 provides a graphical representa-
tion of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for the 
federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals 
derived from the results presented in table 2.  As with 
the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty 
surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons.

pants’ projections.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the

based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more
information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,
on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the
historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around
their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who
judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view
the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of
the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly
balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of
uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around
their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the
box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the fourth quarter of the previous
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed
to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the
previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from
those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated
on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty
and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past
20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year and 
1.1 to 4.9 percent in the second and third years.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the 
third year.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confi-
dence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen-
tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  How-
ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may 
not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate can-
not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular 
projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down-
side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be 
asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
