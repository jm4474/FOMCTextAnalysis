Selection of Committee Officer

Held to serve as deputy general counsel, effective 
September 20, 2016, until the selection of his successor 
at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee 
in 2017. 
 
Revisions to Documents Governing Foreign 
Currency Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) briefed the Committee on a staff proposal to 
revise the documents governing the System’s foreign 
currency operations, including the Authorization for 
Foreign Currency Operations (Foreign Authorization), 
the Foreign Currency Directive (Foreign Directive), and 
the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign 
Currency Operations (Procedural Instructions).  The ob-
jectives of the proposal were to simplify the organization 
of the documents, to better reflect the current operating 
environment, and to clarify guidance provided to the 
Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to ex-
ecute open market transactions (Selected Bank).  The 
staff proposed incorporating the material in the Foreign 
Authorization, Foreign Directive, and Procedural In-
structions into a new authorization and directive that 
would parallel the domestic authorization and directive; 
the Procedural Instructions document would no longer 
be necessary.  The proposed Foreign Authorization was 
structured by operation type, including standalone spot 
and forward transactions; warehousing of funds for the 
Exchange Stabilization Fund; reciprocal currency ar-
rangements, and standing dollar and foreign currency li-
quidity swaps; and foreign currency holdings.  Proposed 
substantive changes to procedures and governance in-
cluded the removal of the Selected Bank’s ability to in-
dependently decide, within limits, to enter into 
standalone spot and forward transactions, the addition 
of a provision for the Foreign Currency Subcommittee 
(Subcommittee) to give additional guidance to the Se-
lected Bank regarding management of SOMA foreign 
currency holdings, and the incorporation of procedures 
that would allow decisions to be made promptly under 
circumstances in which the normal procedures would 
not be feasible.  Additionally, the definition of and pro-
visions governing the Subcommittee were removed 
from the Foreign Authorization and incorporated into 
the Committee’s Rules of Procedure and Rules of Or-
ganization, as appropriate.  By unanimous vote, the pro-
posed Foreign Authorization, Foreign Directive, Rules

of Organization, and Rules of Procedure were approved, 
and the Procedural Instructions were rescinded.4 

AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY 
OPERATIONS 
(As amended effective September 20, 2016) 
 
IN GENERAL 
 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank selected by 
the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to execute open 
market transactions for the System Open Market Ac-
count as provided in this Authorization, to the extent 
necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of 
the Committee: 

A. To purchase and sell foreign currencies (also 
known as cable transfers) at home and abroad in the 
open market, including with the United States Treas-
ury, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank 
for International Settlements, and with other entities 
in the open market.  This authorization to purchase 
and sell foreign currencies encompasses purchases and 
sales through standalone spot or forward transactions 
and through foreign exchange swap transactions.  For 
purposes of this Authorization, foreign exchange 
swap transactions are:  swap transactions with the 
United States Treasury (also known as warehousing 
transactions), swap transactions with other central 
banks under reciprocal currency arrangements, swap 
transactions with other central banks under standing 
dollar liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap ar-
rangements, and swap transactions with other entities 
in the open market. 
B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for-
ward contracts to receive or to deliver, foreign curren-
cies. 

2. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken 
pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise 
authorized by the Committee, be conducted:   

A. In a manner consistent with the obligations re-
garding exchange arrangements under Article IV of 
the Articles of Agreement of the International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF).1 
B. In close and continuous cooperation and consul-
tation, as appropriate, with the United States Treasury.  
C. In consultation, as appropriate, with foreign 
monetary authorities, foreign central banks, and inter-
national monetary institutions. 

                                                 
4 The approved Foreign Authorization and Foreign Directive 
are included in these minutes.  The approved Rules of Organ-
ization and Rules of Procedure, as well as other Committee 

D. At prevailing market rates. 
 
STANDALONE SPOT AND FORWARD 
TRANSACTIONS 
 
3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or 
forward transactions in foreign currencies:  

A. Approval of such operation is required as fol-
lows: 

i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank 
in advance to execute the operation if it would result 
in the overall volume of standalone spot and for-
ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined 
in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding 
$5 billion since the close of the most recent regular 
meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency 
Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct 
the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera-
tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation 
with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail-
able.  
ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee 
to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the 
operation if it would result in the overall volume of 
standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign 
currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au-
thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close 
of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit-
tee.   

B. Such an operation also shall be:   
i. Generally directed at countering disorderly 
market conditions; or 
ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light 
of probable future needs for currencies; or 
iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be 
determined by the Committee. 

C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall 
volume of standalone spot and forward transactions 
in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard-
ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur-
rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the 
transaction. 

 
WAREHOUSING 
 
4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with 
the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re-
quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap 

organizational documents, are available at www.federalre-
serve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_authorizations.htm.

transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza-
tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve 
Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected 
Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected 
Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known 
as warehousing).  
 
RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, 
AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN 
CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 
 
5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established 
under the North American Framework Agreement, 
standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand-
ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro-
vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary 
to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com-
mittee.   

A. For reciprocal currency arrangements all draw-
ings must be approved in advance by the Committee 
(or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-
lieves that consultation with the Committee is not fea-
sible in the time available). 
B. For standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements 
all drawings must be approved in advance by the 
Chairman.  The Chairman may approve a schedule of 
potential drawings, and may delegate to the manager, 
System Open Market Account, the authority to ap-
prove individual drawings that occur according to the 
schedule approved by the Chairman.   
C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar-
rangements all drawings must be approved in advance 
by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the 
Subcommittee believes that consultation with the 
Committee is not feasible in the time available). 
D. Operations involving standing dollar liquidity 
swap arrangements and standing foreign currency li-
quidity swap arrangements shall generally be directed 
at countering strains in financial markets in the United 
States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could 
emerge, so as to mitigate their effects on economic 
and financial conditions in the United States. 
E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing 
dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing for-
eign currency liquidity swap arrangements: 

i. All arrangements are subject to annual review 
and approval by the Committee; 
ii. Any new arrangements must be approved by 
the Committee; and 

iii. Any changes in the terms of existing arrange-
ments must be approved in advance by the Chair-
man.  The Chairman shall keep the Committee in-
formed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall 
be consistent with principles discussed with and 
guidance provided by the Committee. 
 

OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN 
CURRENCIES 
 
6. Any other operations in foreign currencies for 
which governance is not otherwise specified in this Au-
thorization (such as foreign exchange swap transactions 
with private-sector counterparties) must be authorized 
and directed in advance by the Committee. 
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS 
 
7. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
hold foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-
count in accounts maintained at foreign central banks, 
the Bank for International Settlements, and such other 
foreign institutions as approved by the Board of Gover-
nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent 
necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of 
the Committee. 

A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of 
foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-
count:   

i. Primarily, to ensure sufficient liquidity to ena-
ble the Selected Bank to conduct foreign currency 
operations as directed by the Committee; 
ii. Secondarily, to maintain a high degree of 
safety; 
iii. Subject to paragraphs 7.A.i and 7.A.ii, to pro-
vide the highest rate of return possible in each cur-
rency; and 
iv. To achieve such other objectives as may be au-
thorized by the Committee. 

B. The Selected Bank may manage such foreign cur-
rency holdings by:  

i. Purchasing and selling obligations of, or fully 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign 
government or agency thereof (“Permitted Foreign 
Securities”) through outright purchases and sales; 
ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under 
agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For-
eign Securities and selling such securities under 
agreements for the resale of such securities; and 
iii. Managing balances in various time and other 
deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by 
the Board of Governors under Regulation N.

C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the 
Committee, may provide additional instructions to the 
Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren-
cies. 

 
ADDITIONAL MATTERS 
 
8. The Committee authorizes the Chairman:   

A. With the prior approval of the Committee, to en-
ter into any needed agreement or understanding with 
the Secretary of the United States Treasury about the 
division of responsibility for foreign currency opera-
tions between the System and the United States Treas-
ury; 
B. To advise the Secretary of the United States 
Treasury concerning System foreign currency opera-
tions, and to consult with the Secretary on policy mat-
ters relating to foreign currency operations;  
C. To designate Federal Reserve System persons au-
thorized to communicate with the United States 
Treasury concerning System Open Market Account 
foreign currency operations; and 
D. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re-
ports and information to the National Advisory Coun-
cil on International Monetary and Financial Policies. 

9. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in this Au-
thorization, and foreign exchange and investment 
transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to 
undertake, from time to time for the purpose of testing 
operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such 
transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar 
year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior 
notice to the Committee.  
10. All Federal Reserve banks shall participate in the 
foreign currency operations for System Open Market 
Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the 
Board of Governors’ Statement of Procedure with Re-
spect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks 
dated January 1, 1944. 
11. Any authority of the Subcommittee pursuant to 
this Authorization may be exercised by the Chairman if 
the Chairman believes that consultation with the Sub-
committee is not feasible in the time available. The 
Chairman shall promptly report to the Subcommittee 
any action approved by the Chairman pursuant to this 
paragraph. 
12. The Committee authorizes the Chairman, in excep-
tional circumstances where it would not be feasible to 
convene the Committee, to foster the Committee’s ob-
jectives by instructing the Selected Bank to engage in 
foreign currency operations not otherwise authorized 

pursuant to this Authorization.  Any such action shall be 
made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and 
decisions regarding foreign currency operations.  The 
Chairman, whenever feasible, will consult with the Com-
mittee before making any instruction under this para-
graph.

a stable system of exchange rates.  These obligations include 
seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies 
toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth 
with reasonable price stability.  These obligations also include 
avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international

rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori-
zation. 
6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con-
duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera-
tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 9 of the Authorization. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager reported on developments in financial 
markets during the period since the Committee met on 
July 26–27, 2016.  Over much of the period, financial 
market volatility was relatively low, but volatility 
increased somewhat in the last couple of weeks of the 
period amid shifting views among market participants 
about potential monetary policy actions by the Federal 
Reserve and foreign central banks.  The deputy manager 
followed with a briefing on open market operations and 
developments in money markets, including investment 
flows and changes in market interest rates in anticipation 
of the upcoming implementation of reforms to the 
money market fund (MMF) industry.  Usage of the 
System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility 
increased modestly in the most recent intermeeting 
period.  Federal funds generally continued to trade close 
to the middle of the FOMC’s target range of 
¼ to ½ percent.  

The Committee was also briefed on planned revisions to 
the policies of the Open Market Desk on counterparties 
for domestic and foreign open market operations.  The 
proposal was intended in part to create a single unified 
framework for the management of counterparties and to 
increase the transparency of the Desk’s counterparty 
policies.  The Committee indicated its general support 
for the proposal.  Desk staff anticipated that the 
revisions would be published later this year.  

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the September 20–21 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions strength-
ened in recent months and that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) was increasing at a faster pace in the 
third quarter than in the first half of the year.  Consumer 
price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by 
earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-
energy imports.  Survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, 
while market-based measures of inflation compensation 
remained low. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly, 
on average, in July and August.  The unemployment rate 
remained at 4.9 percent in recent months.  Both the la-
bor force participation rate and the employment-to- 
population ratio had edged up since June.  The share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons was 
little changed on balance.  The rates of private-sector job 
openings and of hires increased over June and July, and 
the rate of quits was unchanged.  The four-week moving 
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits continued to be low.  Labor productivity in the 
business sector declined slightly over the four quarters 
ending in the second quarter of 2016.  Measures of labor 
compensation continued to rise at a moderate pace.  
Compensation per hour in the business sector rose 2 
percent over the four quarters ending in the second 
quarter, the employment cost index for private workers 
increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in 
June, and average hourly earnings for all employees in-
creased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in Au-
gust. 

The unemployment rates for African Americans and for 
Hispanics remained above the rate for whites, although 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

the differentials in jobless rates across these groups were 
similar to those before the most recent recession.  The 
employment-to-population ratio for individuals aged 
25 to 64 continued to be higher for whites than for Af-
rican Americans and for Hispanics. 

Total industrial production rose slightly, on net, in July 
and August.  The output of the mining sector increased 
since April after having trended down from late 2014.  
Manufacturing production was unchanged, on balance, 
since June and had generally been moving sideways since 
the end of 2014, as weak export demand and spillovers 
from the decline in crude oil and natural gas drilling 
weighed on industrial activity.  Although automakers’ as-
sembly schedules pointed to some increase in motor ve-
hicle production in the near term, broader indicators of 
manufacturing production, such as new orders diffusion 
indexes from national and regional manufacturing sur-
veys, suggested that factory output would remain on a 
flat trajectory in the coming months. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to be increasing solidly, on net, in the third quar-
ter.  Real PCE rose strongly in July, but the components 
of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE 
were flat in August and the pace of light motor vehicle 
sales softened.  Recent readings on key factors that in-
fluence consumer spending were consistent with solid 
real PCE growth for the third quarter as a whole, includ-
ing continued gains in employment, real disposable per-
sonal income, and households’ net worth.  In addition, 
consumer sentiment as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained relatively up-
beat through early September. 

Recent information on housing activity suggested that 
real residential investment spending continued to be soft 
in the third quarter.  Starts for new single-family homes 
declined, on net, in July and August, as did starts for mul-
tifamily units.  Building permit issuance for new single-
family homes—which tends to be a good indicator of 
the underlying trend in construction—was little 
changed, on balance, in recent months and was essen-
tially flat since late last year.  Sales of new homes in-
creased strongly in July, but sales of existing homes de-
creased modestly. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to be rising slowly in the 
third quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft declined in July.  However, new 
orders for these capital goods rose substantially in July 

and were notably above the level of shipments, suggest-
ing a pickup in business spending for equipment in the 
near term.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential 
structures excluding drilling and mining increased in 
June and July.  The number of oil and gas rigs in opera-
tion, an indicator of spending for structures in the drill-
ing and mining sector, continued to edge up through 
early September.  The limited information available sug-
gested that the change in inventory investment would be 
positive in the third quarter after subtracting substan-
tially from real GDP growth in the second quarter.  Ex-
cept in the energy sector, inventories generally seemed 
well aligned with the pace of sales. 

Nominal outlays for defense through August pointed to 
flat real federal government purchases in the third quar-
ter.  Real state and local government purchases also ap-
peared to be little changed, on net, relative to their level 
in the previous quarter.  Although payrolls for state and 
local governments expanded in July and August, nomi-
nal construction spending by these governments de-
clined in July. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in June be-
fore narrowing substantially in July.  Exports increased 
in both months, with strong growth in July driven by 
higher agricultural exports.  After rising in June, imports 
retraced some of this gain in July, driven by lower im-
ports of consumer goods and capital goods. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased about ¾ percent over the 
12 months ending in July, partly restrained by recent de-
creases in consumer food prices and earlier declines in 
consumer energy prices.  Core PCE price inflation, 
which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was a 
little above 1½ percent over those same 12 months, held 
down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy 
imports over much of this period and the pass-through 
of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of 
other goods and services.  Over the 12 months ending 
in August, total consumer prices as measured by the con-
sumer price index (CPI) rose about 1 percent, while core 
CPI inflation was around 2¼ percent.  The Michigan 
survey measure of median longer-run inflation expecta-
tions edged down in August and was unchanged in early 
September.  The measure of longer-run inflation expec-
tations for PCE prices from the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters was unchanged in the third quarter.  Other 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations from the 
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market 
Participants were also unchanged in September.

Foreign real GDP growth slowed noticeably in the sec-
ond quarter, primarily owing to contractions in Canada 
and Mexico; economic growth in other foreign econo-
mies fell only slightly on average.  Wildfires disrupted oil 
production in Canada, and a second-quarter decline in 
U.S. manufacturing production weighed on Mexican ex-
ports.  Aggregate foreign economic growth appeared to 
pick up in the third quarter amid signs of recovery of oil 
production in Canada and of improved manufacturing 
production in Mexico.  However, weaker investment 
readings pointed to a slight moderation of economic ac-
tivity in China in the third quarter.  The outcome of the 
U.K. referendum on exit from the European Union 
(Brexit) apparently exerted less drag on economic activ-
ity than previously anticipated by many analysts.  None-
theless, recent data suggested that economic growth in 
Europe remained modest.  Inflation was generally sub-
dued in recent months in both the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) and the emerging market economies 
(EMEs). 

Staff Review of Financial Situation 
Domestic financial conditions remained accommodative 
since the July FOMC meeting.  Asset prices moved 
within a fairly narrow range for much of the intermeet-
ing period, although volatility increased somewhat in the 
last few days of the period as market participants fo-
cused on central bank communications in the United 
States and abroad.  Market expectations for a policy rate 
increase by the end of this year rose a bit since the July 
FOMC meeting, reportedly reflecting comments of Fed-
eral Reserve officials that were viewed, on balance, as 
suggesting that the case for policy firming had strength-
ened over recent months.  Nominal Treasury yields 
across the curve edged up.  Anticipation of the impend-
ing deadline for compliance with MMF reform measures 
continued to prompt net outflows from prime MMFs 
and put upward pressure on some term money market 
rates. 

Comments by a number of Federal Reserve officials 
over the intermeeting period were interpreted by market 
participants as raising the odds on policy firming by the 
end of this year.  However, domestic economic data re-
leases appeared to be a little softer, on balance, than in-
vestors had expected; the August employment report 
and manufacturing surveys, in particular, were below ex-
pectations.  Market-based estimates of the probability of 
a rate hike at the September FOMC meeting were vola-
tile but ended the period slightly lower, on balance, at 
roughly 15 percent, while the probability of an increase 
by the end of the year rose slightly to around 50 percent.  
The medium-term federal funds rate path implied by 

market quotes edged up on net.  Consistent with market-
based estimates, respondents to the Desk’s September 
surveys of primary dealers and market participants as-
signed a probability of about 15 percent to a rate hike at 
the September meeting.  The median respondent in each 
survey continued to expect one policy firming in 2016, 
with respondents generally expecting the rate increase to 
occur at the December meeting.  Based on the median 
responses, the most likely path of the target federal 
funds rate in 2017 and 2018 was little changed. 

Nominal Treasury yields increased moderately, on net, 
since the July FOMC meeting, reflecting the slight up-
ward revision in the expected path for the federal funds 
rate and a rise in global bond yields that was apparently 
spurred by an increased impression among investors that 
monetary policy in other advanced economies might be 
less accommodative than previously expected.  Measures 
of forward inflation compensation based on Treasury 
Inflation-Protected Securities rose slightly but remained 
near the lower end of their historical range. 

Broad stock price indexes moved down, on net, since 
the July FOMC meeting.  Realized and implied volatili-
ties in various asset markets were relatively low during 
most of the intermeeting period but increased somewhat 
in the last few days before the meeting as market partic-
ipants reacted to global central bank communications.  
Spreads on yields of both investment-grade and high-
yield nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on com-
parable-maturity Treasury securities declined somewhat 
to levels fairly close to their historical norms. 

MMF reform continued to affect several short-term 
funding markets in advance of the October 14, 2016, 
compliance date.  While total assets under the manage-
ment of MMFs changed little over the intermeeting pe-
riod, investors continued to shift from prime funds to 
government funds.  As a result, MMF holdings of com-
mercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit continued 
to decline, and prime institutional funds further reduced 
their weighted-average maturities to historically low lev-
els.  Reflecting MMFs’ reduced appetite for term lend-
ing, spreads of three-month money market rates over 
rates on comparable-maturity overnight index swap con-
tracts rose during the intermeeting period.  Rates on 
short-term municipal securities and net yields on tax- 
exempt MMFs also increased sharply, primarily because 
of outflows from these funds. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
generally accommodative.  While outstanding commer-
cial and industrial loans and CP both declined somewhat 
in August, gross issuance of corporate bonds was quite

large.  The overall credit quality of the nonfinancial cor-
porate sector, which had deteriorated a bit over the past 
few quarters, showed signs of stabilizing over the inter-
meeting period.  Financing conditions in commercial 
real estate (CRE) markets also remained accommoda-
tive.  Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
issuance picked up in August, likely reflecting the nar-
rowing of CMBS spreads—albeit to levels that were still 
wider than typical—over the past few months.  Growth 
in CRE loans at banks continued to be strong. 

Gross issuance of municipal bonds in July and August 
was strong, credit quality remained stable, and yields on 
municipal bonds edged down.  Although Puerto Rico 
missed a small debt payment due on August 1, prices of 
Puerto Rico’s benchmark general obligation bonds were 
roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period.  

Financing conditions for households generally contin-
ued to be accommodative; however, mortgage markets 
remained relatively tight for borrowers with low credit 
scores.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages 
moved higher, in line with comparable-maturity Treas-
ury yields, but remained at a low level.  Mortgage refi-
nancing activity in August was the highest in three years, 
reflecting lower mortgage rates during June and July.  
Consumer loan balances continued to increase, with 
credit card balances expanding at a robust pace. 

Global risk asset prices broadly increased amid improv-
ing sentiment among investors and low volatility.  Capi-
tal flows to EMEs continued, and sovereign debt 
spreads in these economies and corporate bond spreads 
in both EMEs and AFEs narrowed further.  European 
financial markets remained resilient following the Brexit 
vote, and European bank equity prices increased on net. 

Announcements by foreign central banks garnered in-
vestor attention and contributed to somewhat higher as-
set price volatility later in the period.  The European 
Central Bank left its policy rates and asset purchase pro-
gram unchanged at its September meeting.  Global yields 
moved higher and the euro strengthened following the 
meeting, as some market participants had expected an 
extension of the program.  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) left 
its policy rates unchanged at its July meeting and instead 
expanded its purchases of exchange-traded stock funds 
and introduced additional measures to facilitate dollar 
funding.  Japanese bond yields increased notably and the 
yen appreciated in the aftermath of the announcement.  
At its September meeting, the BOJ introduced a new 
monetary policy framework, which includes yield curve 
control and a commitment to expand the monetary base 

until inflation exceeds 2 percent and stays above that tar-
get in a stable manner.  The introduction of the BOJ’s 
new framework elicited little immediate market reaction 
outside of Japan.  At its early August meeting, the Bank 
of England announced a rate cut, a resumption of its as-
set purchase program, and a new bank funding program.  
Longer-term U.K. yields and the pound fell immediately 
following the announcement but retraced these declines 
following better-than-expected economic data later in 
the period.  The Bank of England maintained its policy 
stance at the September meeting, in line with market ex-
pectations. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the September FOMC meeting, the forecast for real 
GDP growth in 2016 through 2019 was little changed 
from the one presented in July.  The pace of real GDP 
growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of 
this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a mod-
est increase in the rate of growth of private domestic fi-
nal purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory in-
vestment.  The staff continued to project that real GDP 
would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential 
output in 2016 through 2019, supported primarily by in-
creases in consumer spending and, to a lesser degree, by 
somewhat faster growth in business investment begin-
ning next year.  (The staff slightly lowered its assumption 
for potential output growth over the medium term and 
in the longer run.)  The unemployment rate was forecast 
to remain flat over the remainder of this year and then 
to gradually decline through the end of 2019; over this 
period, the unemployment rate was projected to run be-
low the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. 

The forecast for consumer price inflation was essentially 
unchanged from the previous projection.  The staff con-
tinued to project that inflation would increase over the 
next several years, as food and energy prices along with 
the prices of non-energy imports were expected to begin 
steadily rising this year.  However, inflation was pro-
jected to be marginally below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to 
the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that both 
monetary and fiscal policy appeared to be better posi-
tioned to offset large positive shocks than adverse ones.  
In addition, the staff continued to see the risks to the 
forecast from developments abroad as skewed to the 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2016 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

downside.  Consistent with the downside risks to aggre-
gate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for 
the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks 
to the projection for inflation were still judged as 
weighted somewhat to the downside, partly reflecting 
the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations 
may have edged down. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-
flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 
2016 through 2019 and over the longer run.5  Each par-
ticipant’s projections were conditioned on his or her 
judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  The longer-
run projections represented each participant’s assess-
ment of the rate to which each variable would be ex-
pected to converge, over time, under appropriate mone-
tary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the 
economy.  These projections and policy assessments are 
described in the Summary of Economic Projections, 
which is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, participants agreed that information received 
over the intermeeting period suggested that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and growth of eco-
nomic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen 
in the first half of the year.  Although the unemployment 
rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had 
been solid, on average.  Household spending had been 
growing strongly but business fixed investment had re-
mained soft.  Inflation had continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly re-
flecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of 
non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation remained low; most survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed, on balance, in recent months.  Volatility in 
domestic and global asset markets was relatively low 
over most of the intermeeting period, and U.S. financial 
conditions were broadly accommodative. 

Participants generally expected that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market

the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate. 

conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  Infla-
tion was expected to remain low in the near term, in part 
because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 
2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects 
of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated 
and the labor market strengthened further.  A number 
of participants indicated that there had been little change 
in their economic outlooks over recent months.  A sub-
stantial majority now viewed the near-term risks to the 
economic outlook as roughly balanced, with several of 
them indicating the risks from Brexit had receded.  How-
ever, a few still judged that overall risks were weighted 
to the downside, citing various factors that included the 
possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in foreign 
economies, continued uncertainty associated with 
Brexit, the proximity of policy interest rates to the effec-
tive lower bound, or persistent headwinds to economic 
growth.  Participants agreed that the Committee should 
continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and 
global economic and financial developments. 

Growth in consumer spending appeared to have moder-
ated somewhat in the third quarter from its rapid  
second-quarter pace, reflecting a softening in retail sales 
since June.  District contacts provided mixed reports, 
consistent with some easing in growth of sales.  Never-
theless, incoming data pointed to still-solid growth in 
consumption expenditures overall.  Many participants 
noted that they expected household spending to be a pri-
mary contributor to economic growth going forward.  
They saw consumer spending as likely to be supported 
by a number of factors, including ongoing job gains, ris-
ing household income and wealth, improved household 
balance sheets, and buoyant consumer sentiment. 

Economic activity in the second half of the year was ex-
pected to be buoyed in part by a pickup in business fixed 
investment and some rebuilding of inventories.  A recent 
increase in oil drilling rigs in operation was seen as a pos-
itive sign for business investment, although the contin-
ued low level of oil prices was still weighing on capital 
investment in the energy industry.  Contacts in some 
Districts suggested that businesses were taking a cau-
tious approach to capital spending even outside of the 
energy sector—for instance, preferring to modernize ex-
isting manufacturing facilities rather than increase capac-
ity by investing in new facilities—in light of continuing 
sluggish global demand, shorter investment time hori-
zons for businesses, and uncertainty about prospects for

government policy and regulation.  Nonresidential con-
struction was reported to be strong in a few Districts.  
However, the sluggishness in the housing sector ap-
peared to have continued into the third quarter.  A cou-
ple of participants pointed to limited availability of lots 
and a shortage of skilled labor as restraining residential 
construction activity in their Districts; in one District, 
constraints on the supply of new homes for sale were 
expected to boost spending on home improvements and 
offset some of the drag from the slowing in new con-
struction. 

Participants’ reports on the manufacturing sector indi-
cated varying conditions across Districts, but, on the 
whole, manufacturing activity remained flat.  The most 
recent survey evidence was downbeat, although smooth-
ing through the past several months provided a more 
neutral signal.  A couple of participants noted that the 
firming in crude oil prices had led to a stabilization in 
drilling activity.  In the agricultural sector, lower crop 
prices continued to weigh on profit margins, farm in-
come was expected to fall, and loan repayment rates had 
declined. 

Global financial conditions had improved somewhat in 
recent months.  However, participants noted that eco-
nomic growth in many foreign economies remained sub-
dued, and inflation rates abroad generally continued to 
be quite low.  Some participants continued to see im-
portant downside risks from abroad. 

Participants generally agreed that labor market condi-
tions had improved appreciably over the course of the 
year, with monthly payroll gains averaging about 
180,000.  Reports from several Districts indicated wide-
spread increases in employment over the intermeeting 
period.  Although job gains had slowed from their pace 
in 2015, average monthly increases so far this year had 
exceeded most estimates discussed by participants of 
monthly payroll increases that could be expected to pre-
vail with economic growth proceeding at its longer-run 
trend rate.  In addition, several participants cited the rise 
in the labor force participation rate since late 2015 or the 
increase in the employment-to-population ratio—series 
with downward structural trends—as welcome develop-
ments.  However, it was noted that the unemployment 
rate and broader measures of unemployment had 
changed little since the beginning of the year.  Partici-
pants generally expected the unemployment rate to run 
somewhat below their estimates of its longer-run normal 
rate over the next couple of years, but they offered dif-
fering views about the extent of slack that currently re-
mained in the labor market.  Some participants pointed 

to the slowing in payroll gains and modest pickup in 
wages this year and judged that the labor market had lit-
tle or no remaining slack.  Some others noted that still-
muted wage growth, a level of involuntary part-time em-
ployment that remained elevated, and recent increases in 
labor force participation indicated that slack remained in 
resource utilization, or expressed the view that the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment was uncertain 
and could be lower than current estimates.  Participants 
commented on a staff analysis showing differential pat-
terns of unemployment across racial and ethnic groups 
that remained after taking education into account; it was 
suggested that it might be worthwhile to examine such 
issues further.  

Recent readings on headline and core PCE price infla-
tion had come in about as expected, and participants 
continued to anticipate that headline inflation would rise 
over the medium term to the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective.  It was noted, however, that 12-month core PCE 
price inflation had been running at a steady rate below 
2 percent, and several participants commented on fac-
tors that might be expected to restrain increases in infla-
tion.  Such factors included the limited evidence of rising 
cost or price pressures, the apparent low responsiveness 
of inflation to the rate of labor utilization, a possible 
downward shift in inflation expectations, and remaining 
economic slack.  The median expectation for inflation 
over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey 
dropped to its historical low of 2.5 percent in August and 
held steady in September.  However, a couple of partic-
ipants indicated that the drop in some survey-based 
measures of inflation expectations could be explained by 
a decline in the number of respondents who had previ-
ously expected relatively high inflation outcomes.  Over-
all, survey-based measures of longer-term expectations 
were judged to have been reasonably stable in recent 
months.  Many participants observed that core CPI in-
flation had been running appreciably above core PCE 
inflation; it was noted that different weights on rents and 
medical prices as well as different measurement of 
health-care inflation in the two indexes largely accounted 
for the disparity. 

In their discussion of the outlook, participants consid-
ered the likelihood of, and the potential benefits and 
costs associated with, a more pronounced undershoot-
ing of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment than 
envisioned in their modal forecasts.  A number of par-
ticipants noted that they expected the unemployment 
rate to run somewhat below its longer-run normal rate 
and saw a firming of monetary policy over the next few

years as likely to be appropriate.  A few participants re-
ferred to historical episodes when the unemployment 
rate appeared to have fallen well below its estimated 
longer-run normal level.  They observed that monetary 
tightening in those episodes typically had been followed 
by recession and a large increase in the unemployment 
rate.  Several participants viewed this historical experi-
ence as relevant for the Committee’s current deci-
sionmaking and saw it as providing evidence that waiting 
too long to resume the process of policy firming could 
pose risks to the economic expansion, or noted that a 
significant increase in unemployment would have dis-
proportionate effects on low-skilled workers and minor-
ity groups.  Some others judged this historical experience 
to be of limited applicability in the present environment 
because the economy was growing only modestly above 
trend, inflation was below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective, and inflation expectations were low—circum-
stances that differed markedly from those earlier epi-
sodes.  Moreover, the increase in labor force participa-
tion over the past year suggested that there could be 
greater scope for economic growth without putting un-
due pressure on labor markets; it was also noted that the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment could be lower 
than previously thought, with a similar implication.  Par-
ticipants agreed that it would be useful to continue to 
analyze and discuss the dynamics of the adjustment of 
the economy and labor markets in circumstances when 
unemployment falls well below its estimated longer-run 
normal rate. 

With regard to recent financial developments, it was 
noted that regulatory changes and impending MMF re-
forms likely had led to an increase in certain short-term 
interest rates, but these developments were expected to 
have only a small effect on the borrowing costs of non-
financial corporations and little adverse influence on 
overall financial market conditions.  A few participants 
expressed concern that the protracted period of very low 
interest rates might be encouraging excessive borrowing 
and increased leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sec-
tor.  Finally, one participant expressed the view that pro-
longed periods of low interest rates could encourage 
pension funds, endowments, and investors with fixed 
future payout obligations to save more, depressing eco-
nomic growth and adding to downward pressure on the 
neutral real interest rate. 

Participants discussed reasons for the apparent fall over 
recent years in the neutral real rate of interest—or r*—
including lower productivity growth, demographic 
shifts, and an excess of saving around the world.  Al-

though several participants indicated that there was un-
certainty as to how long the low level of r* would persist, 
one pointed to a growing consensus that the long period 
of slow productivity growth and recent evidence that the 
neutral rate had fallen across countries suggested that r* 
was likely to remain low for some time.  A number of 
participants noted that they had revised down their esti-
mates of longer-run r* in their contributions to the Sum-
mary of Economic Projections for this meeting.  Partic-
ipants discussed the implications of a fall in longer-run 
r* for monetary policy, including the possibility that pol-
icy interest rates might be closer to the effective lower 
bound more frequently and for a long period, or that 
monetary policy was ill equipped to address structural 
factors such as the decline in productivity growth.  A 
couple of participants noted that a lower estimated value 
for r* over the near term implied that monetary policy 
was providing less accommodation than previously 
thought.  

Against the backdrop of their economic projections, 
participants discussed whether available information 
warranted taking another step to reduce policy accom-
modation at this meeting.  Participants generally agreed 
that the case for increasing the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate had strengthened in recent months.  
Many of them, however, expressed the view that recent 
evidence suggested that some slack remained in the labor 
market.  With inflation continuing to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective and few signs of in-
creased pressure on wages and prices, most of these par-
ticipants thought it would be appropriate to await further 
evidence of continued progress toward the Committee’s 
statutory objectives.  In contrast, some other partici-
pants believed that the economy was at or near full em-
ployment and inflation was moving toward 2 percent.  
They maintained that a further delay in raising the target 
range would unduly increase the risk of the unemploy-
ment rate falling markedly below its longer-run normal 
level, necessitating a more rapid removal of monetary 
policy accommodation that could shorten the economic 
expansion.  In addition, several participants expressed 
concern that continuing to delay an increase in the target 
range implied a further divergence from policy bench-
marks based on the Committee’s past behavior or risked 
eroding its credibility, especially given that recent eco-
nomic data had largely corroborated the Committee’s 
economic outlook.  

Among the participants who supported awaiting further 
evidence of continued progress toward the Committee’s 
objectives, several stated that the decision at this meeting 
was a close call.  Some participants believed that it would

be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued 
to improve and economic activity strengthened, while 
some others preferred to wait for more convincing evi-
dence that inflation was moving toward the Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  Some participants noted the im-
portance of clearly communicating to the public the con-
ditions that would warrant an increase in the policy rate. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in July indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and growth of eco-
nomic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen 
in the first half of this year.  Although the unemployment 
rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had 
been solid, on average.  Household spending had been 
growing strongly but business fixed investment had re-
mained soft.  Inflation had continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly re-
flecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of 
non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation remained low; most survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed, on balance, in recent months.  In addition, 
financial conditions remained accommodative. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market indicators would strengthen 
somewhat further.  They judged that near-term risks to 
the economic outlook now appeared roughly balanced.   

Members generally acknowledged that labor market con-
ditions had improved appreciably over the past year, ev-
idenced in particular by the solid pace of monthly payroll 
employment gains.  Some of them noted that the in-
crease in the labor force participation rate this year sug-
gested more room for labor supply to expand than pre-
viously expected, or contended that the slower progress 
seen this year in other labor market indicators—such as 
the unemployment rate, broader measures of labor utili-
zation, job openings and quits, and wage growth—indi-
cated that slack was being taken up at only a modest 
pace.  This view suggested that proceeding cautiously 
with reducing monetary policy accommodation could 
promote further labor market improvement.  In con-
trast, a few other members were concerned that, without 
a prompt resumption of gradual increases in the target 
range for the federal funds rate, labor market conditions 

could tighten well beyond normal levels over the next 
few years, potentially necessitating a subsequent sharp 
tightening of monetary policy that could shorten the 
economic expansion. 

Members continued to expect inflation to remain low in 
the near term, but most anticipated that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it would 
rise gradually to the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term.  Many members remarked that 
there were few signs of emerging inflationary pressures 
or that progress on inflation had been slow.  A couple of 
other members pointed to recent readings on core CPI 
inflation as suggesting that PCE price inflation was close 
to meeting the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec-
tive.  Nonetheless, in light of the current shortfall of in-
flation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would 
continue to carefully monitor actual and expected pro-
gress toward the Committee’s inflation goal. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that 
outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this 
meeting.  Members generally agreed that the case for an 
increase in the policy rate had strengthened.  But, with 
some slack likely remaining in the labor market and in-
flation continuing to run below the Committee’s objec-
tive, a majority of members judged that the Committee 
should, for the time being, await further evidence of pro-
gress toward its objectives of maximum employment 
and 2 percent inflation before increasing the target range 
for the federal funds rate.  It was noted that a reasonable 
argument could be made either for an increase at this 
meeting or for waiting for some additional information 
on the labor market and inflation.  A couple of members 
emphasized that a cautious approach to removing ac-
commodation was warranted given the proximity of pol-
icy rates to the effective lower bound, as the Committee 
had more scope to increase policy rates, if necessary, 
than to reduce them.  Three members preferred to raise 
the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points at this meeting.  They cautioned that postponing 
policy firming for too long could push the unemploy-
ment rate markedly below its longer-run normal rate 
over the next few years.  If so, the Committee might then 
need to tighten policy more rapidly, thereby posing risks 
to continued economic expansion.  A couple of these 
members expressed concern about the potential adverse 
effects on the credibility of the Committee’s policy com-
munications if the next step in the gradual removal of 
accommodation was further postponed.

The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its objectives of maxi-
mum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-
ment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  The Committee expected that economic con-
ditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that 
the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the 
longer run.  However, members emphasized that the ac-
tual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the 
economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  Sev-
eral members judged that it would be appropriate to in-
crease the target range for the federal funds rate rela-
tively soon if economic developments unfolded about as 
the Committee expected; they saw the new sentence in 
the third paragraph of the Committee’s statement—a 
sentence indicating that the case for an increase in the 
federal funds rate had strengthened but that the Com-
mittee had decided, for the time being, to wait for fur-
ther evidence of continued progress toward its objec-
tives—as reflecting this view.  A few others, however, 
emphasized that decisions regarding near-term adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy would appropri-
ately remain data dependent and expressed some con-
cern that the new sentence might be misread as indicat-
ing that the passage of time rather than the accumulation 
of evidence would be the key factor in the Committee’s 
decisions at future meetings. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  Members noted 
that this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions.  

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective September 22, 2016, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in July indicates that the 
labor market has continued to strengthen and 
growth of economic activity has picked up from 
the modest pace seen in the first half of this 
year.  Although the unemployment rate is little 
changed in recent months, job gains have been 
solid, on average.  Household spending has 
been growing strongly but business fixed invest-
ment has remained soft.  Inflation has contin-
ued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier de-
clines in energy prices and in prices of non- 
energy imports.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation remain low; most survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expec-
tations are little changed, on balance, in recent 
months.   

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 
with gradual adjustments in the stance of mon-
etary policy, economic activity will expand at a 

Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

moderate pace and labor market conditions will 
strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation is ex-
pected to remain low in the near term, in part 
because of earlier declines in energy prices, but 
to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the 
transitory effects of past declines in energy and 
import prices dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the eco-
nomic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The 
Committee continues to closely monitor infla-
tion indicators and global economic and finan-
cial developments. 

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The Committee 
judges that the case for an increase in the federal 
funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the 
time being, to wait for further evidence of con-
tinued progress toward its objectives.  The 
stance of monetary policy remains accommoda-
tive, thereby supporting further improvement in 
labor market conditions and a return to 2 per-
cent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  In light of the current shortfall of 
inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress 
toward its inflation goal.  The Committee ex-
pects that economic conditions will evolve in a 
manner that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate 
is likely to remain, for some time, below levels 
that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the federal funds 
rate will depend on the economic outlook as in-
formed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 

securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer, 
Jerome H. Powell, and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  Esther L. George, 
Loretta J. Mester, and Eric Rosengren. 

Mses. George and Mester and Mr. Rosengren dissented 
because they preferred to increase the target range for 
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. 

Ms. George judged that with the unemployment rate and 
inflation at or near their longer-run levels, removing 
some accommodation was warranted and would be con-
sistent with the prescriptions of several frameworks for 
assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  She 
was concerned that the Committee’s recent policy 
choices had incorporated too much discretion, and her 
assessment was that by waiting longer to adjust the pol-
icy stance and deviating from the appropriate path to 
policy normalization, the Committee risked eroding the 
credibility of its policy communications.   

Ms. Mester noted that the economy had made consider-
able progress on the Committee’s statutory goals, the 
outlook for continued progress had been corroborated 
by recent economic developments, and risks around that 
outlook had diminished.  In these circumstances, she be-
lieved it appropriate to gradually increase the target 
range for the federal funds rate, consistent with the 
Committee’s recent communications.  A gradual path 
would give the Committee a better chance of recalibrat-
ing the policy path over time as it gains more insights 
into the underlying structure of the economy.  Further 
delays in taking the next step on the gradual path might 
require the Committee to subsequently steepen the pol-
icy path to foster its goals, which would be inconsistent 
with the Committee’s recent communications, thereby 
posing risks to the Committee’s credibility. 

Mr. Rosengren noted that, since the Committee’s most 
recent policy action in late 2015, significant progress had 
been made toward the Committee’s dual mandate.  He 
believed that with inflation gradually rising and robust 
employment growth moving the economy very close to 
full employment, it was appropriate to continue the 
gradual normalization of monetary policy at this meet-
ing.  He believed that a failure to do so could require the

Committee to raise policy interest rates faster and more 
aggressively later on, which could shorten, rather than 
lengthen, the duration of the economic expansion. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors took no action to change the 
interest rates on reserves or discount rates. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, November 1–2, 
2016.  The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. on 
September 21, 2016.  

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on August 16, 2016, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on July 26–27, 2016.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 20–21, 2016, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-
ployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for 
each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.1  
Each participant’s projection was based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and as-
sumptions about the factors likely to affect economic 
outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each 
participant’s assessment of the value to which each var-
iable would be expected to converge, over time, under 
appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of fur-
ther shocks to the economy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her 
individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices. 

Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropri-
ate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) would pick up a bit next year and run at or a 
little above their individual estimates of its longer-run 
rate in 2017 and 2018, and a majority of participants ex-
pected real GDP growth to be at its longer-run trend rate 
in 2019.  A large majority of participants projected that 
the unemployment rate will fall to or modestly below 
their estimates of its longer-run normal level over the 
next two years.  Many participants expected the unem-
ployment rate to edge up to or toward their individual 
estimates of its longer-run level in 2019.  All participants 
projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter 
percentage change in the price index for personal con-
sumption expenditures (PCE), would increase over the 
next two years, and all but one expected inflation to be 
within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective 
in 2019.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics 
for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected 
that the evolution of the economy would warrant only 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and 
maintain the Committee’s objectives over time.  Partici-
pants generally judged that the appropriate level of the 
federal funds rate in 2019 would still be at or below their 
                                                 
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate. 

estimates of its longer-run rate.  However, because the 
economic outlook is inherently uncertain, participants’ 
assessments of appropriate policy are subject to change 
in response to revisions to their economic outlooks and 
associated risks. 

Participants generally viewed the level of uncertainty as-
sociated with their individual forecasts for economic 
growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar 
to the norms of the previous 20 years.  Most participants 
also judged the risks around their projections for eco-
nomic activity and for the unemployment rate as broadly 
balanced, while several participants saw the risks to their 
GDP growth forecasts as weighted to the downside.  In 
addition, most participants saw the risks to their fore-
casts for inflation as broadly balanced, although some 
viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to 
the downside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-
sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 
1.8 percent in 2016, 2 percent in 2017 and 2018, and 
1.8 percent in 2019; the median of projections for the 
longer-run normal GDP growth rate was 1.8 percent.  
Most participants projected that economic growth will 
pick up a bit next year and run at or slightly above their 
individual estimates of its longer-run rate in 2017 and 
2018, and a majority of participants expected real GDP 
growth to be at its longer-run trend rate in 2019.  Partic-
ipants pointed to a number of factors that they expected 
would contribute to above-trend output growth over the 
next few years, including some firming in business in-
vestment, diminution of the drag on net exports from a 
strong dollar, continued improvements in household 
and business balance sheets, and accommodative finan-
cial conditions. 

The median of participants’ projections for real GDP 
growth in 2016 was lower than the median shown in the 
June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  
Many participants who lowered their projections for 
GDP growth this year attributed their revisions to 
weaker-than-expected GDP growth in the first half of 
the year.  The medians of participants’ projections for 
real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 were unchanged

from June at 2 percent.  This pace was slightly above the 
median projection of the longer-run growth rate of 
GDP, which was revised down to 1.8 percent. 

The median of projections for the unemployment rate at 
the end of 2016 was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than in 
June.  Based on the median projections, the unemploy-
ment rate was anticipated to decline to 4.6 percent in 
2017 and to 4.5 percent in 2018 before moving up 
slightly to 4.6 percent in 2019.  The median for 2019 re-
mained below the 4.8 percent median assessment of the 
longer-run normal unemployment rate, with a majority 
of participants projecting the unemployment rate in 
2019 to be 0.2 percentage point or more below their in-
dividual estimates of the longer-run normal rate. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2016 to 2019 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections of GDP 
growth for 2016 shifted lower relative to the distribution 
of the June projections, while the distributions for 2017 
and 2018 were little changed.  The distribution of pro-
jections for GDP growth in the longer run shifted down 
slightly.  The distributions of projections for the unem-
ployment rate were little changed except for a shift up-
ward for 2016. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
In the September SEP, the median of projections for 
headline PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1.3 percent, a 
bit lower than in June.  The projections for headline PCE 
price inflation over the next two years and in the longer 
run were little changed since June, with the median in-
flation projection still rising to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 
to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent in 2018, then 
remaining there in 2019.  All participants but one pro-
jected that inflation will be within 0.1 percentage point 
of the Committee’s objective in 2019.  The median of 
individual projections for core PCE price inflation in-
creases gradually over the next two years. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The distribution of projections for headline PCE 
price inflation for this year shifted down relative to pro-

                                                 
2 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed 
by the view that there are multiple possible medium-term re-
gimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, 
and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way that 
 

jections for the June meeting, with some participants at-
tributing their forecast revisions to weaker-than- 
expected incoming data, while the distribution of projec-
tions for core PCE price inflation this year narrowed.  
For 2017 and 2018, the distributions of projections for 
both total and core PCE price inflation shifted down 
slightly. 

Appropriate monetary policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 
2019 and over the longer run.2  The distributions for 
2016 to 2018 shifted down.  The median projections of 
the federal funds rate continued to show gradual in-
creases, from 0.63 percent at the end of 2016 to 1.13 per-
cent at the end of 2017, 1.88 percent at the end of 2018, 
and 2.63 percent at the end of 2019; the median of the 
longer-run projections of the federal funds rate was 
2.88 percent.  Relative to the June projections, the me-
dian of the projections for the federal funds rate at the 
end of 2016 was 0.25 percentage point lower, and for 
2017 and 2018, the median projections were each 
0.50 percentage point lower.  Compared with the June 
SEP, most participants reduced their projection for the 
federal funds rate in the longer run; the median moved 
down 0.13 percentage point, to 2.88 percent. 

In discussing their September forecasts, many partici-
pants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds 
rate over the next several years would need to be gradual 
in light of a short-term neutral interest rate that was cur-
rently low and likely to rise only slowly.  A number of 
participants attributed the low level of the short-term 
neutral rate to the persistence of low productivity 
growth, continued strength of the dollar, a weak outlook 
for economic growth abroad, demand for safe longer-
term assets, and other factors, and they anticipated that 
the effects of these factors would fade gradually over 
time.  Some participants noted the proximity of short-
term nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound 
as limiting the Committee’s ability to increase monetary 
accommodation to counter adverse shocks to the econ-
omy.  These participants judged that, as a result, the 
Committee should take a cautious approach to removing 
policy accommodation.  Participants cited a number of 

cannot be forecast.  Under this view, the economy currently is 
in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity 
with low productivity growth and a low short-term real inter-
est rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other than in-
flation cannot be usefully projected.

factors that pushed down their projections of the longer-
run federal funds rate, including domestic and global de-
mographic trends and weak productivity growth, which 
together imply a slower pace of trend output growth. 

Uncertainty and risks 
The left-hand column of figure 4 shows that, for each 
variable, all but a few participants judged the levels of 
uncertainty associated with their September projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and head-
line inflation to be broadly similar to the average of the 
past 20 years, and all but one participant viewed uncer-
tainty around core inflation to be broadly similar to its 
average historical level.3  One participant saw uncertainty 
surrounding real GDP growth as higher than average, 
down from three participants in June.  Participants noted 
that continued uncertainty about the rate of productivity 
growth and concerns about international developments 
were sources of uncertainty attending their forecasts of 
real GDP growth.  Most participants’ assessments of the 
level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projec-
tions did not change materially since June. 

For each variable, the number of participants viewing 
the risks as balanced increased since June, and fewer par-
ticipants assessed the risks to economic growth as 
weighted to the downside or viewed the risks to unem-
ployment as weighted to the upside (figure 4, top two 
panels in the right-hand column).  Participants who re-
vised their view from an assessment that the risks to 
GDP growth were to the downside to a view that the 
risks were broadly balanced cited reasons such as an eas-
ing of concerns regarding the potential for global eco-
nomic and financial conditions to deteriorate.  Partici-
pants who saw the risks to GDP growth as tilted to the 
downside attributed this assessment to some signs that 
the momentum of growth in domestic demand may be 
slowing, businesses’ caution regarding investment and 
hiring decisions, the risk of adverse shocks to U.S. eco-
nomic activity from developments abroad, or potential 
limits to the ability of monetary policy to respond to ad-
verse shocks near the effective lower bound on short-
term interest rates.  As indicated in the two bottom-right 
figures, the number of participants who saw the risks to 
their inflation projections as broadly balanced increased; 
those who revised their view from an assessment that 
the risks to inflation were tilted downward pointed to an 
easing of concerns about global financial developments

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the 
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform 
discussions of monetary policy among policy-
makers and can aid public understanding of the 
basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-
tainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relation-
ships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the 
real world, and the future path of the economy 
can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-
ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely eco-
nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-
tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-
ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they oc-
cur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-
tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate 
the considerable uncertainty associated with 
economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that ex-
perienced in the past and the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported in table 2 would imply a probability of 
about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-
pand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the 

current year, 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the second 
year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 
0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for 
overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in 
the current year and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the sec-
ond, third, and fourth years. 

Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, 
participants provide judgments as to whether 
the uncertainty attached to their projections of 
each variable is greater than, smaller than, or 
broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-
certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-
ipants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the up-
side, are weighted to the downside, or are 
broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge 
whether each variable is more likely to be above 
or below their projections of the most likely out-
come.  These judgments about the uncertainty 
and the risks attending each participant’s projec-
tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-
pants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks 
associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of differ-
ent projections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-
certainty arises primarily because each partici-
pant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  
If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected 
manner, then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change 
from that point forward.
