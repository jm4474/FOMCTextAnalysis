(2) To buy and sell bankers' acceptances in the open 

market for its own account; .  

By unanimous vote, paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of the 

Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations were amended, 

effective April 1, 1974, to read as follows: 

(b) To buy or sell in the open market, from or to 
acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, 
or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime 
bankers' acceptances with maturities of up to nine months 
at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the cur
rent shipment of goods between countries or within the 
United States, or (2) arise out of the storage within 
the United States of goods under contract of sale or 
expected to move into the channels of trade within a 
reasonable time and that are secured throughout their 
life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying 
title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate 
amount of bankers' acceptances held at any one time shall 
not exceed $125 million.  

(c) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations 
that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as 
to principal and interest by, any agency of the United 
States, and prime bankers' acceptances of the types 
authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from nonbank 
dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, 
obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at 
rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the 
Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, 
after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of 
agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the 
event Government securities or agency issues covered by



3/18-19/74

any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer 
pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they 
shall be sold in the market or transferred to the 
System Open Market Account; and provided further that 
in the event bankers' acceptances covered by any such 
agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall 
continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or 
shall be sold in the open market.  

By unanimous vote, the staff committee on bankers' 

acceptances was directed to conduct further studies of the 

desirability of expanding Federal Reserve open market operations 

in bankers' acceptances to encompass all types of prime accept

ances, including finance bills.  

By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization 

for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended, effective 

immediately, to read as follows: 

(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, 
including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, 
and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency 
of the United States in the open market, from or to 
securities dealers and foreign and international accounts 
maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, 
regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open 
Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, 
to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency 
securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies 
or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided 
that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal 
agency securities held in such Account (including forward



3/18-19/74

commitments) at the close of business on the day of 
a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken 
with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not 
be increased or decreased by more than $3.0 billion 
during the period commencing with the opening of busi
ness on the day following such meeting and ending with 
the close of business on the day of the next such 
meeting.  

The Committee took note of the present state of de facto 

suspension of paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open 

Market Operations as a consequence of the expiration, on November 

1, 1973, of the underlying statutory authority contained in a 

provision of Section 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act.  

It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of 

Government securities from the System Open Market Account, con

tained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open 

Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to 

annual review.  

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency

currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the 
System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum

6. The Subcommittee named in Section 272.4(c) of 
the Committee's rules of procedure is authorized to 
act on behalf of the Committee when it is necessary to 
enable the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to engage 
in foreign currency operations before the Committee

-13-



3/18-19/74 -14-

By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown 

below was reaffirmed: 

FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE 

1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign 
currencies are: 

A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in 
international exchange markets; 

B. To aid in making the system of international 
payments more efficient; 

C. To further monetary cooperation with central 
banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with 

the International Monetary Fund, and with other international 

payments irstitutions; 

D. To help insure that market movements in exchange 

rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary 

Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, re
flect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus 
serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, 
private and public; and 

E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity 
in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  

2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal 

Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies 

shall be undertaken only when necessary: 

A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows 

of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed 

to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary 

forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the fore
seeable future; and (2) are deemed to be disequilibrating or 
otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S.  
or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for 

example, by occasioning marke anxieties, undesirable specula
tive activity, or excessive leads and lags in international 

payments;



3/18-19/74

B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in 
spot exchange rates,and to moderate forward premiums 
and discounts judged to be disequilibrating. Whenever 
supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in 
one direction, System transactions should be modified or 
curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situ
ation the Committee directs otherwise; 

C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in 
exchange markets. Special factors that might make for 
exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to 
short-run increases in international political tension, (2) 
differences in phasing of international economic activity 
that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials 
between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character 
likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever ex
change market instability threatens to produce disorderly 
conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the 
Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to 
reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more 
consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments.  
In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon 
as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with 
the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose 
in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for foreign currency 
operations, and 

D. To adjust System balances within the limits 
established in the Authorization for foreign currency 
operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  

3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appro
priate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the 
purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  

4. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the 
Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright 
or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken 
only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving 
rise to disequilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) 
to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement 
existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or 
indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or

-15-



3/18-19/74

accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; 

(iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or 
Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap 
arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization 
Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the set
tlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other 
currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of 
foreign currencies.  

By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the 

meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 

20, 1974, were approved.  

The memoranda of discussion for the meetings of the 

Federal Open Market Committee held on January 21-22 and February 

20, 1974, were accepted.  

By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in 

foreign currencies during the period February 20 through March 18, 

1974, were approved, ratified,and confirmed.  

By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months 

of System drawings on the National Bank of Belgium maturing on 

April 18 and 25, 1974, was authorized.  

Secretary's Note: All of the actions listed below 
were taken on Tuesday, March 19, 1974.  

By unanimous vote, the Committee authorized an increase 

from $2 billion to $3 billion in the System's swap line with the 

Bank of England, and the corresponding amendment to paragraph 2 of 

the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, effective 

March 26, 1974.

-16-



3/18-19/74

By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in 

Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' accept

ances during the period February 20 through March 18, 1974, 

were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the 

Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in 

accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
that real output of goods and services is declining in 
the current quarter, in large part because of the oil 
situation, and that prices are continuing to rise rapidly.  
In February industrial production and manufacturing em
ployment declined again, while total nonfarm payroll 
employment recovered, and the unemployment rate was 
unchanged at 5.2 per cent. Prices of farm and food 
products and industrial commodities increased sharply, 
although less so than in the preceding 2 months. Increases 
in wage rates appear to have moderated in recent months.  

After depreciating during the first 3 weeks of 
February, the dollar has since shown little net change 
against leading foreign currencies. The U.S. trade surplus 
remained large in January, despite a further sharp rise 
in the cost of petroleum imports.  

The narrowly defined money stock, after having declined 
in January, increased sharply in February and early March.  
Broader measures of the money stock rose substantially in 
February, as net inflows of consumer-type time deposits remained 
relatively strong. Business short-term borrowing at banks and 
in the open market has continued at a rapid pace. Following 
earlier declines, both short- and long-term market interest 
rates have risen appreciably in recent weeks.

-17-



3/18-19/74

In light of the foregoing developments, it is the 
policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster 
financial conditions conducive to resisting inflation

ary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic 
growth, and maintaining equilibrium in the country's balance 
of payments.  

To implement this policy, while taking account of 
international and domestic financial market developments, 
including the prospective Treasury financing, the Committee 
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions 
that would moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the 
months ahead.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 

would be held on Monday and Tuesday, April 15 and 16, 1974, 

beginning on Monday afternoon.  

The meeting adjourned.

ATTACHMENT A

RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE AUTHORIZING 
CERTAIN ACTIONS BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS DURING AN EMERGENCY 

(As last revised September 21, 1971) 

The Federal Open Market Committee hereby authorizes each 
Federal Reserve Bank to take any or all of the actions set forth 
below during war or defense emergency when such Federal Reserve 
Bank finds itself unable after reasonable efforts to be in com
munication with the Federal Open Market Committee (or with the 
Interim Committee acting in lieu of the Federal Open Market Com
mittee) or when the Federal Open Market Committee (or such 
Interim Committee) is unable to function.  

(1) Whenever it deems it necessary in the light of 
economic conditions and the general credit situation then prevail
ing (after taking into account the possibility of providing 
necessary credit through advances secured by direct obligations 

of the United States under the last paragraph of section 13 of 
the Federal Reserve Act), such Federal Reserve Bank may purchase 
and sell obligations of the United States for its own account, 
either outright or under repurchase agreement, from and to banks, 
dealers or other holders of such obligations.  

(2) Such Federal Reserve Bank may in its discretion 
purchase special certificates of indebtedness directly from the 

United States in such amounts as may be needed to cover over

drafts in the general account of the Treasurer of the United 
States on the books of such Bank or for the temporary accommoda

tion of the Treasury, but such Bank shall take all steps practi
cable at the time to insure as far as possible that the amount 

of obligations acquired directly from the United States and held 

by it, together with the amount of such obligations so acquired 

and held by all other Federal Reserve Banks, does not exceed 

$5 billion at any one time.  

(3) Such Federal Reserve Bank may engage in operations 

of the types specified in the Committee's authorization for 

System foreign currency operations when requested to do so by 

an authorized official of the U.S. Treasury Department; provided, 
however, that such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the 

time to insure as far as possible that, in light of the informa
tion available on other System foreign currency operations, its 

own operations do not result in the aggregate in breaching any 
of the several dollar limits specified in the authorization.



- 2

Authority to take the actions set forth shall be 
effective only until such time as the Federal Reserve Bank 
is able again to establish communications with the Federal 
Open Market Committee (or the Interim Committee), and such 
Committee is then functioning.
