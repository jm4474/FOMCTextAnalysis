Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Mar-
ket Account (SOMA) reported on developments in do-
mestic and foreign financial markets.  The deputy man-
ager followed with a review of System open market op-
erations conducted during the period since the Commit-
tee met on January 27–28, 2015.  The deputy manager 
also discussed the outcomes of recent tests of supple-
mentary normalization tools—namely, the Term De-
posit Facility (TDF) and term and overnight reverse re-
purchase agreement operations (term RRP operations 
and ON RRP operations, respectively).  The TDF oper-
ations were executed as three overlapping 21-day term 
operations with same-day settlement; the total amount 
of term deposits outstanding peaked at roughly the same 

level as in the largest operation conducted in prior test-
ing.  The term RRP operations were executed as a series 
of four one-week operations and conducted away from 
quarter-end; take-up primarily represented substitution 
away from ON RRP operations.  The combination of 
these term and ON RRP test operations continued to 
provide a soft floor for money market rates over the in-
termeeting period. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the 
intermeeting period.  There were no intervention 
operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account 
over the intermeeting period. 

Normalization Tools 
A staff briefing provided background on options for set-
ting the aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility in the 
early stages of the normalization process.  Two options 
were discussed:  initially setting a temporarily elevated 
aggregate cap or suspending the aggregate cap for a 
time.  The briefing noted that, as the balance sheet nor-
malizes and reserve balances decline, usage of the ON 
RRP facility should diminish, allowing the facility to be 
phased out over time.  In addition, the briefing outlined 
strategies for actively reducing take-up at the ON RRP 
facility after policy normalization is under way, while 
maintaining an appropriate degree of monetary control, 
if take-up is larger than the FOMC desires.  These strat-
egies included adjusting the values of the interest on ex-
cess reserves (IOER) and ON RRP rates associated with 
a given target range for the federal funds rate, relying on 
tools such as term RRPs and the TDF to broaden arbi-
trage opportunities and to drain reserve balances, and 
selling shorter-term Treasury securities to reduce the size 
of the balance sheet at a faster pace.  In addition, the 
briefing presented some information on specific calibra-
tions of policy tools that could be used during the early 
stages of policy normalization. 

In their discussion of the options and strategies sur-
rounding the use of tools at liftoff and the potential sub-
sequent reduction in aggregate ON RRP capacity, par-
ticipants emphasized that during the early stages of pol-
icy normalization, it will be a priority to ensure appropri-
ate control over the federal funds rate and other short-
term interest rates.  Against this backdrop, participants 
generally saw some advantages to a temporarily elevated 
aggregate cap or a temporary suspension of the cap to 
ensure that the facility would have sufficient capacity to 
support policy implementation at the time of liftoff, but 
they also indicated that they expected that it would be 
appropriate to reduce ON RRP capacity fairly soon after

the Committee begins firming the stance of policy.  A 
couple of participants stated their view that the risks to 
financial stability that might arise from a temporarily el-
evated aggregate ON RRP capacity were likely to be 
small, and it was noted that there might be little potential 
for a temporarily large Federal Reserve presence in 
money markets to affect the structure of those markets 
if plans for reducing the facility’s capacity were clearly 
communicated and well understood.  However, a couple 
of participants expressed financial stability concerns, and 
one stressed that more planning was needed to address 
the potential risks before the Committee decides on the 
appropriate level of ON RRP capacity at the time of lift-
off. 

In their discussion regarding strategies for reducing ON 
RRP usage, should it become undesirably large during 
the early stages of normalization, most participants 
viewed raising the IOER rate, thereby widening the 
spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates, as an ap-
propriate initial step.  A majority of participants thought 
term reserve draining tools could be useful in reducing 
ON RRP usage, although a couple of participants ques-
tioned their effectiveness in placing upward pressure on 
market interest rates, and a few did not see term RRPs 
as reducing the Federal Reserve’s presence in money 
markets, arguing that investors view term and overnight 
RRPs as close substitutes.  Many participants mentioned 
that selling assets that will mature in a relatively short 
time could be considered at some stage, if necessary to 
reduce ON RRP usage.  However, a number of partici-
pants noted that it could be difficult to communicate the 
reason for such sales to the public, and, in particular, that 
the announcement of such sales would risk an outsized 
market reaction, as the public could view the sales as a 
signal of a tighter overall stance of monetary policy than 
they had anticipated or as an indication that the Com-
mittee might be more willing than had been thought to 
sell longer-term assets.  Some participants pointed out 
that an earlier end to reinvestments of principal on ma-
turing or prepaying securities would help reduce the level 
of reserve balances, thereby increasing the effectiveness 
of the IOER rate and allowing a more rapid reduction in 
the size of the ON RRP facility.  A number of partici-
pants suggested that it would be useful to consider spe-
cific plans for these and other details of policy normali-
zation under a range of post-liftoff scenarios. 

                                                 
3 The statement titled Policy Normalization Principles and 
Plans is available on the Board’s website at www.federalre-
serve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm. 

Participants also discussed whether to communicate to 
the public additional details regarding the approach they 
intend to take when it becomes appropriate to begin the 
normalization process, including the width of the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the settings of the IOER 
and ON RRP rates, and the use of supplementary tools.  
A couple of participants suggested communicating a 
specific commitment to reducing ON RRP capacity 
soon after liftoff.  However, a number of participants 
emphasized that maintaining control of short-term in-
terest rates would be paramount in the initial stages of 
policy normalization, and that it was difficult to know in 
advance when a reduction would be appropriate.  They 
therefore desired to retain some flexibility over the tim-
ing of any reduction.  That said, many participants 
agreed that an elevated aggregate capacity for the facility 
would likely be appropriate only for a short period after 
liftoff. 

At the conclusion of their discussion, all participants 
agreed to augment the Committee’s Policy Normaliza-
tion Principles and Plans by providing the following ad-
ditional details regarding the operational approach the 
FOMC intends to use when it becomes appropriate to 
begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy.3 

When economic conditions warrant the commencement 
of policy firming, the Federal Reserve intends to: 

 Continue to target a range for the federal funds rate 
that is 25 basis points wide. 

 Set the IOER rate equal to the top of the target 
range for the federal funds rate and set the offering 
rate associated with an ON RRP facility equal to the 
bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate. 

 Allow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to 
be temporarily elevated to support policy implemen-
tation; adjust the IOER rate and the parameters of 
the ON RRP facility, and use other tools such as 
term operations, as necessary for appropriate mon-
etary control, based on policymakers’ assessments 
of the efficacy and costs of their tools.  The Com-
mittee expects that it will be appropriate to reduce 
the capacity of the facility fairly soon after it com-
mences policy firming. 

A staff briefing outlined some options for further testing 
of term RRP operations over future quarter-ends.  While 
the tests of term RRPs to date had been informative, the 
staff suggested that if the Committee envisioned using

term RRPs as part of its strategy at liftoff, or potentially 
at some other point during normalization, continued 
testing may be useful.  Participants discussed whether a 
resolution that authorized term RRP test operations at 
quarter-ends through the end of 2015 might reduce the 
probability that market participants mistakenly interpret 
future decisions about testing term RRPs over quarter-
ends as containing information about the likely timing of 
liftoff.  It was noted that such a resolution would be 
more efficient from an administrative and communica-
tions standpoint, as it would simply allow a continuation 
of recent quarter-end testing of term RRPs.  Moreover, 
the resolution would not convey any information regard-
ing either the timing of the start of policy normalization 
or whether term RRP operations might be employed at 
the time of liftoff and, if so, for how long. 

Following the discussion of the testing of term RRP 
operations, the Committee approved the following 
resolution on term RRP testing over quarter-ends 
through January 29, 2016: 

“During each of the periods of June 18 to 29, 
2015; September 18 to 29, 2015; and December 
17 to 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market Com-
mittee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York to conduct a series of term 
reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. 
government securities.  Such operations shall:  
(i) mature no later than July 8, 2015, October 7, 
2015, and January 8, 2016, respectively; (ii) be 
subject to an overall size limit of $300 billion 
outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a 
maximum bid rate of five basis points above the 
ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of 
the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: 
(A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of 
the bids received is less than or equal to the pre-
announced size of the operation, or (B) at the 
stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in 
ascending order by submitted rate up to the 
point at which the total quantity of bids equals 
the preannounced size of the operation, with all 
bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-
out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded 
on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counter-
party offers received is greater than the prean-
nounced size of the operation.  Such operations 
may be for forward settlement.  The System 
Open Market Account manager will inform the 
FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned 
operations.  The Chair must approve the terms 
of, timing of the announcement of, and timing 

of the operations.  These operations shall be 
conducted in addition to the authorized over-
night reverse repurchase agreements, which re-
main subject to a separate overall size limit au-
thorized by the FOMC.”  

Mr. Lacker dissented in the vote on the resolution be-
cause the March end-of-quarter testing had not yet been 
completed and he felt that there was no need to author-
ize additional testing before then. 

The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discus-
sion of normalization tools. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the March 17‒18 meeting 
suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth moderated in the first quarter and that labor mar-
ket conditions improved further.  Consumer price infla-
tion was restrained significantly by declines in energy 
prices and continued to run below the FOMC’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation were still low, while survey 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained 
stable. 

Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand 
strongly in January and February.  The unemployment 
rate declined to 5.5 percent in February.  Both the labor 
force participation rate and the employment-to-         
population ratio rose slightly over the first two months 
of the year, and the share of workers employed part time 
for economic reasons edged down.  The rate of private-
sector job openings moved up in January and was at an 
elevated level; the rate of quits remained the same as in 
the fourth quarter, but the rate of hiring stepped down. 

Industrial production decreased a little, on net, in Janu-
ary and February, as declines in the output of the manu-
facturing and mining sectors more than offset an in-
crease in utilities production.  Some indicators of mining 
activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in operation, 
dropped further.  However, automakers’ assembly 
schedules and broader indicators of manufacturing pro-
duction, such as the readings on new orders from na-
tional and regional manufacturing surveys, generally 
pointed to modest gains in factory output in coming 
months. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to decelerate somewhat going into the first quar-
ter after rising markedly in the fourth quarter.  The com-
ponents of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bu-
reau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of 
PCE declined slightly in January and February, and light

motor vehicle sales stepped down; unusually severe 
weather in some regions in February may have ac-
counted for a small part of the slowing in consumer 
spending in that month.  Recent information about key 
factors that influence household spending pointed to-
ward a pickup in PCE in the coming months.  The pur-
chasing power of households’ income continued to be 
supported by low energy prices, and real disposable in-
come rose briskly in January.  Moreover, households’ net 
worth likely increased as equity prices and home values 
advanced further, and consumer sentiment in the Uni-
versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers was still near 
its highest level since prior to the most recent recession. 

The pace of activity in the housing sector remained slow.  
Both starts and building permits for new single-family 
homes declined over January and February.  Starts of 
multifamily units also decreased, on net, over the past 
two months.  Sales of new and existing homes moved 
down in January, although pending home sales increased 
somewhat. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property products appeared to be expanding in 
the first quarter at about the same modest pace as in the 
previous quarter.  Both nominal orders and shipments 
of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in 
January.  New orders for these capital goods remained 
above the level of shipments, indicating that shipments 
may increase in subsequent months.  Other forward-
looking indicators, such as national and regional surveys 
of business conditions, were generally consistent with 
modest increases in business equipment spending in the 
near term.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential 
structures moved down in January after rising in the 
fourth quarter. 

Federal spending data for January and February pointed 
toward a further decline in real federal government pur-
chases in the first quarter.  Real state and local govern-
ment purchases appeared to be rising modestly in the 
first quarter as their payrolls increased in recent months, 
although their construction expenditures decreased a lit-
tle in January. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially 
in December before narrowing somewhat in January.  
Exports declined in both December and January, reflect-
ing weak agricultural goods exports, the lower price of 
petroleum products, and falling or flat exports of most 
other categories of goods.  Imports rose in December, 
with an increased volume of petroleum imports, but de-
clined in January, driven by lower prices and volumes for 
petroleum. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, edged up only ¼ percent over the                  
12 months ending in January, as energy prices declined 
significantly.  The core PCE price index, which excludes 
food and energy prices, rose 1¼ percent over the same 
12-month period.  Measures of expected long-run infla-
tion from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan 
survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers, remained stable.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation were still low.  Measures of 
labor compensation continued to increase at a modest 
pace, although faster than consumer prices.  Both com-
pensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and 
the employment cost index rose 2¼ percent over the 
year ending in the fourth quarter.  Average hourly earn-
ings for all employees increased 2 percent over the         
12 months ending in February. 

Foreign real GDP appeared to expand at a moderate 
pace in the fourth quarter.  While GDP growth stepped 
down in several economies, including Canada and China, 
it picked up in the euro area, Japan, and Mexico.  Indi-
cators for the first quarter suggested continued firming 
in the euro area and further slowing in China and Can-
ada.  Consumer prices in many foreign economies de-
clined further in the first months of this year, reflecting 
the falls in energy prices as well as decreases in food 
prices in some emerging market economies.  Many cen-
tral banks took steps to ease monetary policy during the 
period, including the European Central Bank (ECB), 
which began purchasing sovereign bonds under its pub-
lic sector purchase program (PSPP), and the People’s 
Bank of China, which lowered required reserve ratios for 
banks.  A number of other central banks in advanced 
and emerging market economies cut policy interest rates. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Movements in asset prices over the intermeeting period 
largely seemed to reflect receding concerns about down-
side risks to the global economic outlook.  Two strong 
U.S. employment reports and the January consumer 
price index release, all of which were above market ex-
pectations; the start of sovereign bond purchases by the 
ECB; and the somewhat more encouraging economic 
news from Europe all appeared to contribute to the im-
proved sentiment in financial markets.  Equity prices 
were higher, on net, although they declined later in the 
period. 

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting 
period, including the minutes of the January FOMC 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 17–18, 2015 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



meeting, reportedly were perceived as slightly more ac-
commodative than expected on balance.  Market com-
mentary also highlighted Chair Yellen’s statement at the 
Monetary Policy Report testimony that the eventual removal 
of the language in the policy statement noting that “the 
Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to 
normalize the stance of monetary policy” should not be 
viewed as indicating that the federal funds rate would 
necessarily be increased within a couple of meetings.  
However, the effects of these communications on the 
expected path for the federal funds rate were more than 
offset by reactions to stronger-than-expected data for 
the labor market and consumer inflation, along with per-
ceptions of receding downside risks to the foreign eco-
nomic outlook.  On net, the expected path for the fed-
eral funds rate implied by financial market quotes shifted 
up over the period. 

Yields on nominal Treasury securities increased across 
the maturity spectrum, and the Treasury yield curve 
steepened.  Measures of inflation compensation based 
on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased 
early in the intermeeting period amid rising oil prices but 
ended the period little changed, on net, after oil prices 
dropped back. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes moved up, on balance, 
over the intermeeting period, and one-month  option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index moved down on 
net.  Spreads of 10-year corporate bond yields over those 
on comparable-maturity Treasury securities for both 
BBB-rated and speculative-grade issuers narrowed nota-
bly, likely reflecting increased appetite for riskier invest-
ments.  While the tightening of spreads was broad based, 
the declines in short- and intermediate-term spreads for 
speculative-grade energy firms were particularly pro-
nounced, retracing most of their strong run-up ap-
proaching the end of last year. 

Results from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and 
Survey of Market Participants for March indicated that 
the respondents attached the greatest probabilities to the 
first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate 
occurring at either the June or September FOMC meet-
ing; those probabilities were marked up relative to the 
January survey.  In addition, survey respondents widely 
expected the “patient” language to be removed from the 
FOMC statement following the March meeting.  Condi-
tional on this change in the statement, respondents as-
signed a roughly 40 percent probability, on average, to 
liftoff occurring two meetings ahead and assigned most 
of the remaining probability to later dates. 

Credit conditions faced by large nonfinancial firms re-
mained generally accommodative.  Corporate bond issu-
ance increased in February, mostly reflecting activity by 
investment-grade firms.  Commercial and industrial 
loans on banks’ books continued to expand strongly, re-
portedly in part to fund increased merger and acquisition 
activity.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance during Jan-
uary and February was supported by strong issuance of 
new money loans, while refinancing activity effectively 
came to a stop, likely reflecting elevated loan spreads.  
On net, issuance of collateralized loan obligations was 
only modestly below the strong pace registered in the 
fourth quarter of 2014. 

Financing for the commercial real estate (CRE) sector 
stayed broadly available over the intermeeting period.  
Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books remained solid, 
in part supported by loans to finance construction activ-
ity.  The issuance of commercial mortgage-backed secu-
rities (CMBS) was still robust so far this year, and 
spreads continued to be low.  After taking into account 
deals in the pipeline for March, issuance in the first quar-
ter of 2015 was expected to be the strongest since the 
financial crisis.  According to the March Senior Credit 
Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, 
dealers’ willingness to provide warehouse financing for 
loans intended for inclusion in CMBS increased since 
the beginning of 2014.  In addition, demand for funding 
of CMBS by hedge funds and real estate investment 
trusts reportedly rose over the same period. 

Credit conditions for mortgages remained tight for risk-
ier borrowers, with relatively few mortgages originated 
to borrowers in the lower portion of the credit score dis-
tribution.  For borrowers who qualify for a mortgage, 
the cost of credit stayed low by historical standards. 

Consumer credit rose further over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Auto and student loan balances continued to ex-
pand robustly through January, while credit card bal-
ances decelerated slightly.  Issuance of consumer asset-
backed securities remained robust. 

The dollar appreciated against most other currencies 
over the intermeeting period, as policymakers in the euro 
area, Sweden, Denmark, and many emerging market 
economies eased monetary policy even as market partic-
ipants anticipated monetary policy tightening in the 
United States.  Central bank policymakers in Sweden and 
Denmark lowered the rates on their respective deposit 
facilities further below zero.  In addition, in Sweden, the 
benchmark repurchase agreement (or repo) rate was re-
duced in February to below zero for the first time, and a 
further cut was announced in March.  Equity prices rose

in most of the advanced foreign economies, with euro-
area stocks rallying both before and after the early March 
commencement of sovereign bond purchases by the 
ECB under its PSPP.  Stock market performance in the 
emerging market economies was more varied, with net 
losses in some and net gains in others.  Yields on Ger-
man government securities declined, with negative yields 
extending to longer maturities than at the time of the 
January meeting, likely in reaction to the PSPP, and yield 
spreads of most other euro-area sovereign bonds over 
German bonds narrowed.  The main exception was 
Greek bonds, spreads on which widened, on net, amid 
heightened volatility as negotiations between Greece and 
its official creditors over support for the country’s public 
finances continued.  Yields on the long-term sovereign 
bonds of many other countries, including Japan and the 
United Kingdom, rose during the period. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for 
the March FOMC meeting, projected real GDP growth 
in the first half of this year was lower than in the forecast 
prepared for the January meeting, largely reflecting 
downward revisions to the near-term forecasts for 
household spending, net exports, and residential invest-
ment.  The staff’s medium-term forecast for real GDP 
growth also was revised down, mostly because of the ef-
fects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar.  Nonetheless, the staff continued to 
forecast that real GDP would expand at a faster pace 
than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by 
increases in consumer and business confidence and a 
small pickup in foreign economic growth, even as the 
normalization of monetary policy was assumed to begin.  
In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to slow toward, 
but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth.  
The expansion in economic activity over the medium 
term was anticipated to gradually reduce resource slack; 
the unemployment rate was expected to decline slowly 
and to temporarily move a little below the staff’s esti-
mate of its longer-run natural rate.  In its medium-term 
and longer-run projections, the staff slightly lowered its 
assumptions for potential GDP growth and real equilib-
rium interest rates. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was lit-
tle changed, with the large declines in energy prices since 
last June still anticipated to lead to a temporary decrease

in the 12-month change in total PCE prices in the first 
half of this year.  The staff’s forecast for inflation in 2016 
and 2017 was unchanged, as energy prices and non-oil 
import prices were still expected to bottom out and 
begin rising later this year; inflation was projected to 
move closer to, but remain below, the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent over those years.  In-
flation was anticipated to move back to 2 percent there-
after, with inflation expectations in the longer run as-
sumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective 
and slack in labor and product markets projected to have 
waned. 

The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its 
March projections for real GDP growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the 
past 20 years.  The risks to the forecasts for real GDP 
growth and inflation were viewed as tilted a little to the 
downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither 
monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to 
help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  At the 
same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook 
for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and participating Federal Re-
serve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for 
each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer 
run, conditional on each participant’s judgment of ap-
propriate monetary policy.4  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.  These eco-
nomic projections and policy assessments are described 
in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is at-
tached as an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants regarded the information 
received over the intermeeting period as indicating that 
the pace of economic activity had moderated somewhat.  
Labor market conditions continued to improve, with 
strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate, and 

and Blake Prichard, First Vice Presidents of the Federal Re-
serve Banks of Dallas and Philadelphia, respectively, submit-
ted economic projections.

participants judged that underutilization of labor re-
sources was continuing to diminish.  A number of par-
ticipants noted that slow growth of productivity or the 
labor force could reconcile the moderation in economic 
growth with the solid performance of some labor market 
indicators.  Participants expected that, over the medium 
term, real economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and there would be additional improvements in la-
bor market conditions.  Participants generally regarded 
the net effect of declines in energy prices as likely to be 
positive for economic activity and employment in the 
United States, although a couple noted that physical lim-
its on the accumulation of stocks of crude oil could re-
sult in further downward pressure on prices and reduce 
U.S. oil and gas production and investment.  Inflation 
had declined further below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and 
was expected to stay near its recent low level in the near 
term.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation 
5 to 10 years ahead remained low, while survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations had re-
mained stable.  Participants generally anticipated that in-
flation would rise gradually toward the Committee’s        
2 percent objective as the labor market improved further 
and the transitory effects of energy price declines and 
other factors dissipated.  While almost all participants 
noted potential risks to the economic outlook resulting 
from foreign economic and financial developments, 
most saw the risks to the outlook for economic growth 
and the labor market as nearly balanced. 

Household spending appeared to have slowed some-
what over the intermeeting period, with some partici-
pants suggesting that the recent softness in spending in-
dicators was likely due in part to transitory factors, such 
as unseasonably cold winter weather in parts of the 
country.  Some participants expressed the view that 
growth in consumer spending over the medium term 
would be supported by the strong labor market and ris-
ing income, increases in wealth and improvements in 
household balance sheets, lower gasoline prices, and 
gains in consumer confidence.  Although activity in the 
housing sector remained sluggish, a few participants 
were cautiously optimistic that recent higher rates of 
household formation, together with low mortgage rates, 
would enable a faster pace of recovery. 

Business contacts in many parts of the country contin-
ued to express optimism about prospects for future sales 
or investment.  However, there were widespread reports 
of a slowdown in growth during the first quarter across 
a range of industries, partly reflecting severe winter 
weather in some regions as well as labor disputes at West 

Coast ports that temporarily disrupted some supply 
chains.  In several parts of the country, persistently low 
oil prices had resulted in declines in drilling and delays 
in planned capital expenditures in the energy sector, and 
had negatively affected state government revenues.  
Manufacturing contacts in a couple of regions reported 
a softening in export sales.  In contrast, service-sector 
activity had been reasonably strong in several parts of 
the country, as had auto sales, and the increase in house-
hold purchasing power from lower gasoline prices was 
expected to boost retail sales.  Labor market conditions 
continued to improve in most regions, with wage pres-
sures generally reported to be modest. 

In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, sev-
eral participants noted that the dollar’s further apprecia-
tion over the intermeeting period was likely to restrain 
U.S. net exports and economic growth for a time.  A few 
participants suggested that accommodative policy ac-
tions by a number of foreign central banks could lead to 
a further appreciation of the dollar, but another noted 
that such actions had also strengthened the outlook for 
growth abroad, which would bolster U.S. exports.  Par-
ticipants pointed to a number of risks to the interna-
tional economic outlook, including the slowdown in 
growth in China, fiscal and financial problems in Greece, 
and geopolitical tensions. 

Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor 
market conditions over the intermeeting period, includ-
ing strong gains in payroll employment and a further re-
duction in the unemployment rate.  Several participants 
judged, based on the improvement in a variety of labor 
market indicators, that the economy was making further 
progress toward the Committee’s goal of maximum em-
ployment.  Nonetheless, many judged that some degree 
of labor market slack remained, as evidenced by the low 
rate of labor force participation, still-elevated involun-
tary part-time employment, or subdued growth in wages.  
A few of them noted that continued modest wage 
growth could prompt them to reduce their estimates of 
the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  A few 
participants observed that the absence of a notable 
pickup in wages might not be a useful yardstick for eval-
uating the degree of remaining slack because of the long 
lags between declines in unemployment and the re-
sponse of wages or uncertainty about trend productivity 
growth.  One participant, however, saw some evidence 
of rising wage growth and suggested that compositional 
changes in the labor force could be masking underlying 
wage pressures, particularly as measured by average 
hourly earnings.

Many participants judged that the inflation data received 
over the intermeeting period had been about in line with 
their expectations that inflation would move temporarily 
further below the Committee’s goal, largely reflecting 
declines in energy prices and lower prices of non-oil im-
ports.  They continued to expect that inflation would 
move up toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term as the effects of these transitory 
factors waned and conditions in the labor market im-
proved further.  Survey-based measures of inflation ex-
pectations had remained stable, and market-based 
measures of inflation compensation over the longer 
term were about unchanged from the time of the January 
meeting, although they had exhibited some volatility 
over the intermeeting period.  It was noted that the    
market-based measures had tracked quite closely the 
movements in crude oil prices over the period, first ris-
ing and then falling back.  Participants offered various 
explanations for this correlation, including that market-
based measures of inflation compensation were re-
sponding to the same global developments as oil prices, 
that these measures were capturing changes in risk or li-
quidity premiums, or that inflation-indexed securities 
were subject to mispricing.  A couple of participants 
pointed out that the movements in crude oil prices and 
market-based inflation compensation measures had not 
been particularly well aligned over a longer historical pe-
riod, or that information gleaned from inflation deriva-
tives suggested a substantial increase in the probability 
that inflation would remain well below the Committee’s 
target over the next decade.  One of them judged that 
the low level of inflation compensation could reflect in-
creased concern on the part of investors about adverse 
outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by 
weak economic activity, and that it was important not to 
dismiss this possible interpretation. 

In their discussion of communications regarding the 
path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, al-
most all participants favored removing from the forward 
guidance in the Committee’s postmeeting statement the 
indication that the Committee would be patient in be-
ginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.  
These participants continued to think that an increase in 
the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely in 
April.  But, with continued improvement in economic 
conditions, they preferred language that would provide 
the Committee with the flexibility to subsequently adjust 
the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-
by-meeting basis.  It was noted that eliminating the ref-
erence to being patient would be appropriate in light of 

the considerable progress achieved toward the Commit-
tee’s objective of maximum employment, and that such 
a change would not indicate that the Committee had de-
cided on the timing of the initial increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  Participants generally 
judged that the appropriate timing of liftoff would de-
pend on their assessment of improvement in the labor 
market and their degree of confidence that inflation 
would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent objec-
tive over the medium term, and that it would be helpful 
to convey to the public this data-dependent approach to 
monetary policy.  A few participants emphasized that the 
decision regarding the appropriate timing of liftoff 
should take account of the risks that could be associated 
with departing from the effective lower bound later and 
those that could be associated with departing earlier.  
One participant did not favor the change to the forward 
guidance because, with inflation well below the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent longer-run target, the announcement of a 
meeting-by-meeting approach to policy could lead to a 
tightening of financial conditions that would slow pro-
gress toward the Committee’s objectives. 

Participants expressed a range of views about how they 
would assess the outlook for inflation and when they 
might deem it appropriate to begin removing policy ac-
commodation.  It was noted that there were no simple 
criteria for such a judgment, and, in particular, that, in a 
context of progress toward maximum employment and 
reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 
percent over the medium term, the normalization pro-
cess could be initiated prior to seeing increases in core 
price inflation or wage inflation.  Further improvement 
in the labor market, a stabilization of energy prices, and 
a leveling out of the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
were all seen as helpful in establishing confidence that 
inflation would turn up.  Several participants judged that 
the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant 
beginning normalization at the June meeting.  However, 
others anticipated that the effects of energy price de-
clines and the dollar’s appreciation would continue to 
weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that con-
ditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising 
rates until later in the year, and a couple of participants 
suggested that the economic outlook likely would not 
call for liftoff until 2016.  With regard to communica-
tions about the timing of the first increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate, two participants thought 
that the Committee should seek to signal its policy in-
tentions at the meeting before liftoff appeared likely, but 
two others judged that doing so would be inconsistent

with a meeting-by-meeting approach.  Finally, many par-
ticipants commented that it would be desirable to pro-
vide additional information to the public about the 
Committee’s strategy for policy after the beginning of 
normalization.  Some participants emphasized that the 
stance of policy would remain highly accommodative 
even after the first increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate, and several noted that they expected 
economic developments would call for a fairly gradual 
pace of normalization or that a data-dependent ap-
proach would not necessarily dictate increases in the tar-
get range at every meeting. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in January indicated that economic 
growth had moderated somewhat.  Labor market condi-
tions had improved further, with strong job gains and a 
lower unemployment rate; a variety of labor market in-
dicators suggested that the underutilization of labor re-
sources continued to diminish.  Household spending 
was rising moderately, with declines in energy prices 
boosting household purchasing power.  Business fixed 
investment was advancing, although the recovery in the 
housing sector remained slow and export growth had 
weakened.  Inflation had declined further below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting the 
declines in energy prices.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation remained low; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been 
stable.  The Committee expected that, with appropriate 
monetary policy accommodation, economic activity 
would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indi-
cators would continue to move toward levels the Com-
mittee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The 
Committee also expected that inflation would remain 
near its recent low level in the near term but rise gradu-
ally toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor 
market improves further and the transitory effects of en-
ergy price declines and other factors dissipate.  In light 
of the uncertainties attending the outlook for inflation, 
the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 

In their discussion of language for the postmeeting state-
ment, the Committee agreed that the data received over 
the intermeeting period suggested that economic growth 
had moderated somewhat.  One factor behind that mod-
eration was a slowdown in the growth of exports, and 
members decided that the statement should explicitly 
note that factor.  In addition, data received over the in-
termeeting period indicated that inflation had declined, 

as the Committee had anticipated, and members agreed 
to update the statement to reflect their judgment that in-
flation was likely to remain near its recent low level in 
the near term.  Members also judged that it was appro-
priate to note that market-based measures of inflation 
compensation remained near levels registered at the time 
of the January FOMC meeting. 

The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm 
in the statement that the Committee’s decision about 
how long to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of ac-
tual and expected progress toward its objectives of max-
imum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Members 
continued to judge that this assessment of progress 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments.  In 
light of the considerable progress to date toward the 
Committee’s maximum-employment objective and the 
implications of that progress for the outlook for infla-
tion, members agreed to remove from the forward guid-
ance in the postmeeting statement the indication that the 
Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to 
normalize the stance of monetary policy and to indicate 
instead that the Committee anticipates that it will be ap-
propriate to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor 
market and is reasonably confident that inflation will 
move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  Members viewed the new guidance as consistent 
with the outlook for policy that the Committee had ex-
pressed in January, and they agreed that the postmeeting 
statement should note that an increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate remained unlikely at the April 
FOMC meeting; in addition, they generally saw the new 
language as providing the Committee with the flexibility 
to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate 
in June or at a subsequent meeting.  Members noted that 
the timing of the first increase would depend on the evo-
lution of economic conditions and the outlook, and that 
the change in the forward guidance was not intended to 
indicate that the Committee had decided on the timing 
of the initial increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its policy of re-
investing principal payments from agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-
backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Com-
mittee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable lev-
els, should help maintain accommodative financial con-
ditions.  The Committee agreed to reiterate its expecta-
tion that, even after employment and inflation are near 
mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, 
for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds 
rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will foster 
maximum employment and price stability.  In 
particular, the Committee seeks conditions in 
reserve markets consistent with federal funds 
trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The 
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open 
market operations as necessary to maintain such 
conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
maintain its policy of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities into new issues and its policy 
of reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in 
dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.  The System Open Market Account 
manager and the secretary will keep the 
Committee informed of ongoing developments 
regarding the System’s balance sheet that could 
affect the attainment over time of the 
Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and price stability.”   

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in January suggests that 
economic growth has moderated somewhat.  
Labor market conditions have improved fur-
ther, with strong job gains and a lower unem-
ployment rate.  A range of labor market indica-
tors suggests that underutilization of labor re-
sources continues to diminish.  Household 

spending is rising moderately; declines in energy 
prices have boosted household purchasing 
power.  Business fixed investment is advancing, 
while the recovery in the housing sector remains 
slow and export growth has weakened.  Infla-
tion has declined further below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting de-
clines in energy prices.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expec-
tations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 
with appropriate policy accommodation, eco-
nomic activity will expand at a moderate pace, 
with labor market indicators continuing to 
move toward levels the Committee judges con-
sistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee 
continues to see the risks to the outlook for eco-
nomic activity and the labor market as nearly 
balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near 
its recent low level in the near term, but the 
Committee expects inflation to rise gradually to-
ward 2 percent over the medium term as the la-
bor market improves further and the transitory 
effects of energy price declines and other fac-
tors dissipate.  The Committee continues to 
monitor inflation developments closely. 

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the Com-
mittee today reaffirmed its view that the current 
0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate remains appropriate.  In determining how 
long to maintain this target range, the Commit-
tee will assess progress—both realized and ex-
pected—toward its objectives of maximum em-
ployment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-
ment will take into account a wide range of in-
formation, including measures of labor market 
conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on financial 
and international developments.  Consistent 
with its previous statement, the Committee 
judges that an increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April 
FOMC meeting.  The Committee anticipates 
that it will be appropriate to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate when it has seen 
further improvement in the labor market and is 
reasonably confident that inflation will move

back to its 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  This change in the forward guidance does 
not indicate that the Committee has decided on 
the timing of the initial increase in the target 
range. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the 
Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accom-
modative financial conditions. 

When the Committee decides to begin to re-
move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-
anced approach consistent with its longer-run 
goals of maximum employment and inflation of 
2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates 
that, even after employment and inflation are 
near mandate-consistent levels, economic con-
ditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the 
target federal funds rate below levels the      
Committee views as normal in the longer run.” 

Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dud-
ley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley Fischer, Jef-
frey M. Lacker, Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome H. Powell, 
Daniel K. Tarullo, and John C. Williams. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 28–29, 
2015.  The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. on March 
18, 2015. 

Notation Vote 

By notation vote completed on February 17, 2015, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on January 27–28, 2015.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 17–18, 2015, meet-
ing participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each 
year from 2015 to 2017 and over the longer run.1  Each 
participant’s projection was based on information avail-
able at the time of the meeting plus his or her assessment 
of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about 
the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.  The 
longer-run projections represent each participant’s as-
sessment of the value to which each variable would be 
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to 
the economy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined 
as the future path of policy that each participant deems 
most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and 
inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpreta-
tion of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum 
employment and stable prices. 
 
________________ 
1 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas did not 
participate in this FOMC meeting, and the incoming president 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is scheduled to 
assume office on July 1.  Helen E. Holcomb and Blake Prich-
ard, First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dal-
las and Philadelphia, respectively, submitted economic projec-
tions.  
 

All FOMC participants but one expected that economic 
growth under appropriate policy would be somewhat 
faster in 2015 and in 2016 than their individual estimates 
of the U.S. economy’s longer-run normal growth rate 
and at or near its longer-run rate in 2017 (table 1 and 
figure 1).  Most participants projected that the unem-
ployment rate would continue to decline in 2015 and 
2016, and all participants projected that the unemploy-
ment rate would be at or below their individual judg-
ments of its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017.  
Participants saw inflation, as measured by the four-   
quarter change in the price index for personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCE), slowing this year but picking 
up notably next year; almost all of the participants pro-
jected that inflation would be at or close to the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective in 2017. 

As shown in figure 2, all but two participants anticipated 
that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target 
range for the federal funds rate in 2015.  Most expected 
that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal 
funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period as 
labor market conditions and inflation move toward val-
ues the Committee judges consistent with the attainment 
of its mandated objectives of maximum employment 
and stable prices.  Most participants continued to expect 
that it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to 
stay appreciably below its longer-run level after inflation 
and unemployment are near mandate-consistent levels,

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under
appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of
0 to 1/4 percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In December 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who
judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 15, and 2.
In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1/8 percentage point) of an individual
participant’s judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate

reflecting the effects of remaining headwinds holding 
back the recovery, along with other factors. 

Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with 
their outlooks for economic growth and the unemploy-
ment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the 
past 20 years.  Most participants also judged the level of 
uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the 
average level of the past 20 years, although several par-
ticipants viewed it as higher.  In addition, most partici-
pants continued to see the risks to the outlook for eco-
nomic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly 
balanced, though some viewed the risks to economic 
growth as weighted to the downside.  Equal numbers of 
participants saw the risks to inflation as balanced or as 
weighted to the downside, while one judged these risks 
as tilted to the upside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
Participants generally projected that, conditional on their 
individual assumptions about appropriate monetary pol-
icy, real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow in 
2015 and 2016 at a pace somewhat faster than their esti-
mates of its longer-run normal rate and at or near its 
longer-run rate in 2017.  Participants pointed to a num-
ber of factors that they expected would contribute to 
solid real output growth over the next few years, includ-
ing improving labor market conditions, strengthened 
household and business balance sheets, the boost to 
consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing 
restraint from fiscal policy, and still-accommodative 
monetary policy. 

Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) contributions in December, all but a couple of 
participants revised down their projections of real GDP 
growth over the forecast period.  A number of partici-
pants cited the further appreciation of the dollar and re-
cent weakness in spending and production data as rea-
sons for their revision.  The central tendencies of partic-
ipants’ current projections for real GDP growth were  
2.3 to 2.7 percent in 2015 and in 2016, and 2.0 to             
2.4 percent in 2017.  The central tendency of the projec-
tions of real GDP growth over the longer run was 2.0 to 
2.3 percent, unchanged from December. 

Most participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would continue to decline through 2016, and all pro-
jected that by the fourth quarter of 2017 the unemploy-
ment rate would be at or below their individual judg-
ments of its longer-run normal level.  The central 
tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemploy-
ment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.0 to 
5.2 percent in 2015, 4.9 to 5.1 percent in 2016, and         

4.8 to 5.1 percent in 2017.  Compared with the Decem-
ber SEP, participants’ projected paths for the unemploy-
ment rate generally shifted down slightly through 2017.  
Many participants noted that recent data pointing to 
faster-than-expected improvement in labor market con-
ditions were an important factor underlying the down-
ward revisions to their unemployment rate forecasts.  
More than half of the participants revised down their es-
timates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment; 
as a result, the central tendency of these estimates shifted 
down to 5.0 to 5.2 percent.  Several participants noted 
that still-subdued wage and price inflation despite the 
stronger-than-expected momentum in the labor market 
suggested a lower level of the longer-run normal unem-
ployment rate than they had thought previously, and a 
couple mentioned research indicating that demographic 
groups with lower average unemployment rates have   
accounted for an increasing fraction of the labor force. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of partici-
pants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate through 2017.  Some 
of the diversity of views reflected participants’ individual 
assessments of the effects of lower oil prices on con-
sumer spending and business investment, of the extent 
to which dollar appreciation would affect real activity, of 
the rate at which the forces that have been restraining 
the pace of the economic recovery would continue to 
abate, of the trajectory for growth in consumption as    
labor market slack diminishes, and of the appropriate 
path of monetary policy.  Relative to the December SEP, 
the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP 
growth was a bit narrower from 2015 through 2017, 
while for the unemployment rate, the dispersion was 
roughly unchanged. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
Compared with the December SEP, all participants 
marked down their projections for PCE inflation this 
year, noting that inflation had been running below their 
earlier projections and that significant declines in energy 
prices and import prices were putting temporary down-
ward pressure on inflation.  All participants saw PCE in-
flation picking up in 2016, and almost all saw inflation at 
or close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objec-
tive in 2017.  All of the participants also marked down 
their projections for core PCE inflation this year, and 
nearly half revised down their projections for core PCE 
inflation in 2016 by 0.2 percentage point or more, with 
many noting that core inflation had run below their ear-
lier projections in recent months and several citing de-
clines in non-oil import prices and pass-through of de-

clines in energy prices.  Almost all expected core infla-
tion to rise gradually over the projection period and to 
reach a level at or near 2 percent in 2017.  The central 
tendencies for PCE inflation were 0.6 to 0.8 percent in 
2015, 1.7 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.9 to 2.0 percent 
in 2017, and the central tendencies for core PCE infla-
tion were 1.3 to 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.5 to 1.9 percent 
in 2016, and 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017.  Factors cited by 
participants as likely to contribute to a rise of inflation 
toward 2 percent included stable longer-term inflation 
expectations, steadily diminishing resource slack, a 
pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of declines in 
energy prices, and still-accommodative monetary policy. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The range of participants’ projections for PCE in-
flation in 2015 narrowed somewhat compared with De-
cember.  The range for PCE inflation in 2016 widened 
slightly, likely reflecting in part differences in partici-
pants’ assessments of the effects of the declines in en-
ergy and import prices on the outlook for inflation.  Sim-
ilarly, the ranges for core PCE inflation narrowed in 
2015 and widened slightly in 2016.  The range for both 
measures in 2017 was relatively little changed and con-
tinued to show a very substantial concentration near the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective by that time. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise 
the target range for the federal funds rate over the pro-
jection period as labor market conditions and inflation 
move toward values the Committee judges consistent 
with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maxi-
mum employment and price stability.  As shown in fig-
ure 2, all but two participants anticipated that it would 
be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the 
federal funds rate during 2015.  However, a large major-
ity projected that the appropriate level of the federal 
funds rate would remain below their individual estimates 
of its longer-run normal level through 2017. 

Most participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would be at or somewhat above their estimates of its 
longer-run normal level at the end of the year in which 
they judged the initial increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate would be warranted.  Almost all par-
ticipants projected that inflation would be below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective that year, but they also 
saw inflation rising substantially closer to 2 percent in 
the following year. 

Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 

federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2015 to 2017 and over the longer run.  The median val-
ues of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015, 2016, 
and 2017 decreased 50, 62, and 50 basis points, respec-
tively, relative to December, to 0.63, 1.88, and 3.13 per-
cent, while the mean values for those years declined     
35, 52, and 32 basis points, respectively, to 0.78, 2.03, 
and 3.19 percent.  Compared with December, the dis-
persion of the projections for the appropriate level of 
the federal funds rate was a bit narrower over the pro-
jection period. 

Most participants judged that it would be appropriate for 
the federal funds rate in 2017 to remain below its longer-
run normal level, with nearly half of them projecting the 
federal funds rate in 2017 to be more than ½ percentage 
point lower than their estimates of its longer-run value.  
Participants provided a number of reasons why they 
thought it would be appropriate for the federal funds 
rate to remain below its longer-run normal level for 
some time after inflation and the unemployment rate 
were near mandate-consistent levels.  These reasons in-
cluded an assessment that the headwinds that have been 
holding back the recovery will continue to exert some 
restraint on economic activity at that time, that weak real 
activity abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar 
are likely to continue to restrain U.S. net exports for 
some time, that residual slack in the labor market will 
still be evident in measures of labor utilization other than 
the unemployment rate, and that the risks to the eco-
nomic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the con-
straints on monetary policy associated with the effective 
lower bound on the federal funds rate. 

Relative to the December SEP, almost half of the partic-
ipants revised down their estimates of the longer-run 
level of the federal funds rate, typically by ¼ percentage 
point, with a lower assessment of the economy’s longer-
run potential growth rate generally cited as a contrib-
uting factor for those revisions.  Though the median es-
timate of the longer-run normal federal funds rate was 
unchanged from December, the central tendency nar-
rowed to 3.5 to 3.75 percent from 3.5 to 4.0 percent in 
December, and the range moved down a bit to 3.0 to 
4.25 percent from 3.25 to 4.25 percent in December.  All 
participants judged that inflation in the longer run would 
be equal to the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 per-
cent, implying that their individual judgments regarding 
the appropriate longer-run level of the real federal funds 
rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy 
ranged from 1.0 to 2.25 percent.

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary 
policy were informed by their judgments about the state 
of the economy, including the values of the unemploy-
ment rate and other labor market indicators that would 
be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to 
which the economy was currently falling short of maxi-
mum employment, the prospects for inflation to return 
to the Committee’s longer-term objective of 2 percent, 
the implications of international developments for the 
domestic economy, the desire to minimize potential dis-

the federal funds rate. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of 
uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to 
the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).2  Most 
participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks 
for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, though some 
participants viewed the risks to real GDP growth as 
weighted to the downside.  Those participants who 
viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited, for 
example, concern about the limited ability of monetary 
policy at the effective lower bound to respond to further 
negative shocks to the economy or about the trajectory 
for economic growth abroad.  Nearly all participants 
again judged the risks to the outlook for the unemploy-
ment rate to be broadly balanced. 

As in the December SEP, participants generally agreed 
that the levels of uncertainty associated with their infla-
tion forecasts were broadly similar to historical norms.  
Almost half of participants viewed the risks to their in-
flation forecast as balanced.  However, the risks were 
seen as tilted to the downside by an equal number of 
participants, an increase since the December SEP.  
These participants cited the possibility that the recent 
low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than 
anticipated or that the upward pressure on prices from 
inflation expectations might be weaker than assumed, or 
the judgment that, in current circumstances, it would be 
difficult for the Committee to respond effectively to 
low-inflation outcomes.  Conversely, one participant saw 
upside risks to inflation, citing uncertainty about the tim-
ing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of mon-
etary policy accommodation.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-
jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable uncertainty associat-
ed with economic forecasts.  For example, 
suppose a participant projects that real gross 
domestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the 
uncertainty attending those projections is simi-
lar to that experienced in the past and the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a 
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP  would expand  within a range of  1.4  to 

4.6 percent in the current year, 0.9 to 5.1 per-
cent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent 
in the third year.  The corresponding 70 percent 
confidence intervals for overall inflation would 
be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year and 1.0 
to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. 

Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds 
rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This 
uncertainty arises primarily because each partic-
ipant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over 
time.  If economic conditions evolve in an un-
expected manner, then assessments of the ap-
propriate setting of the federal funds rate 
would change from that point forward.
