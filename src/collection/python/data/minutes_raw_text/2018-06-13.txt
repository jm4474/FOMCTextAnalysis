Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) provided a summary of developments in do-
mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet-
ing period.  Developments in emerging market econo-
mies (EMEs) and in Europe were the focus of consider-
able attention by financial market participants over re-
cent weeks.  Investor perceptions of increased economic 
and political vulnerabilities in several EMEs led to a no-
table depreciation in EME currencies relative to the dol-
lar.  Market participants reported that an unwinding of 
investor positions had been a factor amplifying these 
currency moves.  In Europe, concerns about the political 
situation in Italy and its potential economic implications 
prompted a significant widening in risk spreads on Ital-
ian sovereign securities.  The share prices of Italian 
banks and other banks that could be exposed to Italy 
declined sharply.  In domestic financial markets, expec-
tations for the path of the federal funds rate were little 
changed over the intermeeting period.  The manager 
noted that the release of the minutes of the May FOMC 
meeting, and particularly the reference to a possible tech-
nical adjustment in the interest on excess reserves 
(IOER) rate relative to the top of the FOMC’s target 
range for the federal funds rate, prompted a small reduc-
tion in federal funds futures rates. 

The deputy manager followed with a discussion of 
money markets and open market operations.  Rates on 
Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) had remained el-
evated in recent weeks, apparently responding, in part, 
to increased Treasury issuance over recent months.  In 
light of the firmness in repo rates, the volume of opera-
tions conducted through the Federal Reserve’s over-
night reverse repurchase agreement facility remained 
low.  Elevated repo rates may also have contributed to 
some upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate 
in recent weeks as lenders in that market shifted some of 
their investments to earn higher rates available in repo 
markets.  The deputy manager also discussed the current 
outlook for reinvestment purchases of agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS).  Based on current projections, 
principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency MBS would likely be lower than the monthly cap 
on redemptions that will be in effect beginning in the fall 
of this year.  Consistent with the June 2017 addendum 
to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, rein-
vestment purchases of agency MBS then are projected 

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 
 

 
 

to fall to zero from that point onward.  However, prin-
cipal payments on agency MBS are sensitive to changes 
in various factors, particularly long-term interest rates.  
As a result, agency MBS principal payments could rise 
above the monthly redemption cap in some future sce-
narios and thus require MBS reinvestment purchases.  In 
light of this possibility, the deputy manager described 
plans for the Desk to conduct small value purchases of 
agency MBS on a regular basis in order to maintain op-
erational readiness.   

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet-
ing period. There were no intervention operations in for-
eign currencies for the System's account during the in-
termeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the June 12–13 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions continued to 
strengthen in recent months, and that real gross domes-
tic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a solid rate in 
the first half of the year.  Consumer price inflation, as 
measured by the 12-month percentage change in the 
price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE), was 2 percent in April.  Survey-based measures 
of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed 
on balance. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong 
pace, on average, in April and May.  The national unem-
ployment rate edged down in both months and was 
3.8 percent in May.  The unemployment rates for Afri-
can Americans, Asians, and Hispanics all declined, on 
net, from March to May; the rate for African Americans 
was the lowest on record but still noticeably above the 
rates for other groups.  The overall labor force partici-
pation rate edged down in April and May but was still at 
about the same level as a year earlier.  The share of work-
ers employed part time for economic reasons was little 
changed at a level close to that from just before the pre-
vious recession.  The rate of private-sector job openings 
rose in March and stayed at that elevated level in April; 
the rate of quits edged up, on net, over those two 
months; and initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits continued to be low through early June.  Recent 
readings showed that increases in labor compensation 
stepped up over the past year.  Compensation per hour 
in the nonfarm business sector increased 2.7 percent 
over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of this 
year (compared with 1.9 percent over the same four 
quarters a year earlier), and average hourly earnings for 
all employees increased 2.7 percent over the 12 months 

ending in May (compared with 2.5 percent over the same 
12 months a year earlier). 

Total industrial production increased at a solid pace in 
April, but the available indicators for May, particularly 
production worker hours in manufacturing, indicated 
that output declined in that month.  Automakers’ sched-
ules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles 
would increase in the coming months, and broader indi-
cators of manufacturing production, such as the new or-
ders indexes from national and regional manufacturing 
surveys, continued to point to solid gains in factory out-
put in the near term. 

Consumer spending appeared to be increasing briskly in 
the second quarter after rising at only a modest pace in 
the first quarter.  Real PCE increased at a robust pace in 
April after a strong gain in March.  Although light motor 
vehicle sales declined in May, indicators of vehicle de-
mand generally remained upbeat.  More broadly, recent 
readings on key factors that influence consumer spend-
ing—including gains in employment, real disposable 
personal income, and households’ net worth—contin-
ued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the 
near term.  In addition, the lower tax withholding result-
ing from the tax cuts enacted late last year still appeared 
likely to provide some additional impetus to spending in 
coming months.  Consumer sentiment, as measured by 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, re-
mained elevated in May. 

Residential investment appeared to be declining further 
in the second quarter after decreasing in the first quarter.  
Starts for new single-family homes were unchanged in 
April from their first-quarter average, but starts of mul-
tifamily units declined noticeably.  Sales of both new and 
existing homes decreased in April. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to be rising at a moderate 
pace in the second quarter after a somewhat faster in-
crease in the first quarter.  Nominal shipments of non-
defense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in April, 
and forward-looking indicators of business equipment 
spending—such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods 
orders, along with upbeat readings on business senti-
ment from national and regional surveys—continued to 
point to robust gains in equipment spending in the near 
term.  Real business expenditures for nonresidential 
structures appeared to be expanding at a solid pace again 
in the second quarter, and the number of crude oil and 
natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business

spending for structures in the drilling and mining sec-
tor—increased, on net, from mid-April through early 
June. 

Nominal federal government spending data for April 
and May pointed to an increase in real federal purchases 
in the second quarter.  Real state and local government 
purchases also appeared to be moving up; although 
nominal construction expenditures by these govern-
ments edged down in April, their payrolls rose at a mod-
erate pace, on net, in April and May. 

Net exports made a negligible contribution to real GDP 
growth in the first quarter, with growth of both real ex-
ports and real imports slowing from the brisk pace of 
the fourth quarter of last year.  After narrowing in 
March, the nominal trade deficit narrowed further in 
April, as exports continued to increase while imports de-
clined slightly, which suggested that net exports might 
add modestly to real GDP growth in the second quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 2.0 percent over the 12 months 
ending in April.  Core PCE price inflation, which ex-
cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 
1.8 percent over that same period.  The consumer price 
index (CPI) rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending 
in May, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent.  Recent 
readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla-
tion expectations—including those from the Michigan 
survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the 
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market 
Participants—were little changed on balance. 

Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity 
continued to expand at a solid pace.  Real GDP growth 
picked up in the first quarter in several EMEs—includ-
ing Mexico, China, and much of emerging Asia—al-
though recent indicators pointed to some moderation in 
the pace of activity in most EMEs.  By contrast, in the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth 
slowed in the first quarter, owing partly to temporary 
factors such as labor strikes in some European countries 
and bad weather in Japan.  More recent indicators 
pointed to a partial rebound in AFE economic growth 
in the second quarter.  Inflation pressures in the foreign 
economies generally remained subdued, even though 
higher oil prices put some upward pressure on headline 
inflation. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
During the intermeeting period, global financial markets 
were buffeted by increased concerns about the outlook 
for foreign growth and political developments in Italy, 

but these concerns subsequently eased.  On net, Treas-
ury yields were little changed despite significant intra- 
period moves, and the dollar appreciated notably as a 
range of AFE and EME currencies and sovereign bonds 
came under pressure.  However, broad domestic stock 
price indexes increased, on net, as generally strong cor-
porate earnings reports helped support prices.  Mean-
while, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses 
and households remained supportive of economic activ-
ity on balance. 

Over the intermeeting period, macroeconomic data re-
leases signaling moderating growth in some foreign 
economies, along with downside risks stemming from 
political developments in Italy and several EMEs, 
weighed on prices of foreign risk assets.  These develop-
ments, together with a still-solid economic outlook for 
the United States, supported an increase in the broad 
trade-weighted index of the foreign exchange value of 
the dollar. 

The dollar appreciated notably against several EME cur-
rencies (primarily those of Argentina, Turkey, Mexico, 
and Brazil), as the increase in U.S. interest rates since late 
2017, along with political developments and other issues, 
intensified concerns about financial vulnerabilities.  
EME mutual funds saw slight net outflows, and, on bal-
ance, EME sovereign spreads widened and equity prices 
edged lower.  In the AFEs, sovereign spreads in some 
peripheral European countries widened and European 
bank shares came under pressure, as investors focused 
on political developments in Italy.  Broad equity indexes 
in the euro area, with the exception of Italy, ended the 
period little changed, while those in Canada, the United 
Kingdom, and Japan edged higher.  Market-based 
measures of expected policy rates were little changed, on 
balance, and flight-to-safety flows reportedly contrib-
uted to declines in German longer-term sovereign yields. 

FOMC communications over the intermeeting period—
including the May FOMC statement and the May 
FOMC meeting minutes—elicited only minor reactions 
in asset markets.  Quotes on federal funds futures con-
tracts suggested that the probability of an increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the 
June FOMC meeting inched up further to near certainty.  
Levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 
2020 implied by overnight index swap (OIS) rates were 
little changed on net. 

Longer-term nominal Treasury yields ended the period 
largely unchanged despite notable movements during 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 
 

 
 

the intermeeting period.  Measures of inflation compen-
sation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Secu-
rities were also little changed on net. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 5 per-
cent, on net, since the May FOMC meeting, boosted in 
part by the stronger-than-expected May Employment 
Situation report.  Stock prices also appeared to have 
been buoyed by first-quarter earnings reports that gen-
erally beat expectations—particularly for the technology 
sector, which outperformed the broader market.  How-
ever, the turbulence abroad and, to a lesser degree, 
mounting concerns about trade policy weighed on equity 
prices at times.  Option-implied volatility on the 
S&P 500 at the one-month horizon—the VIX—was 
down somewhat, on net, remaining just a couple of per-
centage points above the very low levels that prevailed 
before early February.  Over the intermeeting period, 
spreads of yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds over 
those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities wid-
ened moderately for both investment- and speculative-
grade firms.  However, these spreads remained low by 
historical standards. 

Over the intermeeting period, short-term funding mar-
kets stayed generally stable despite still-elevated spreads 
between rates on some private money market instru-
ments and OIS rates of similar maturity.  While some of 
the factors contributing to pressures in short-term fund-
ing markets had eased recently, the three-month spread 
between the London interbank offered rate and the OIS 
rate remained significantly wider than at the start of the 
year. 

Growth of outstanding commercial and industrial loans 
held by banks appeared to have moderated in May after 
a strong reading in April.  The issuance of institutional 
leveraged loans was strong in April and May; meanwhile, 
corporate bond issuance was weak, likely reflecting sea-
sonal patterns.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds in 
April and May was solid, as issuance continued to re-
cover from the slow pace recorded at the start of the 
year. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
remained accommodative.  Even so, the growth of CRE 
loans held by banks ticked down in April and May.  
Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issu-
ance, in general, continued at a robust pace; although is-
suance softened somewhat in April, partly reflecting sea-
sonal factors, it recovered in May.  Spreads on CMBS 
were little changed over the intermeeting period, remain-
ing near their post-crisis lows. 

Residential mortgage financing conditions remained ac-
commodative for most borrowers.  For borrowers with 
low credit scores, conditions stayed tight but continued 
to ease.  Growth in home-purchase mortgages slowed a 
bit and refinancing activity continued to be muted in re-
cent months, with both developments partly reflecting 
the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were 
little changed in the first few months of 2018, on bal-
ance, and remained largely supportive of growth in 
household spending.  Growth in consumer credit slowed 
a bit in the first quarter, as seasonally adjusted credit card 
balances were about flat after having surged in the fourth 
quarter of last year.  Financing conditions for consumers 
with subprime credit scores continued to tighten, likely 
contributing to a decline in auto loan extensions to such 
borrowers. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared for the June 
FOMC meeting, the staff continued to project that the 
economy would expand at an above-trend pace.  Real 
GDP appeared to be rising at a much faster pace in the 
second quarter than in the first, and it was forecast to 
increase at a solid rate in the second half of this year.  
Over the 2018–20 period, output was projected to rise 
further above the staff’s estimate of its potential, and the 
unemployment rate was projected to decline further be-
low the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate.  
Relative to the forecast prepared for the May meeting, 
the projection for real GDP growth beyond the first half 
of 2018 was revised down a little in response to a higher 
assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar.  In 
addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply 
constraints might restrain output growth somewhat.  
With real GDP rising a little less, on balance, over the 
forecast period, the projected decline in the unemploy-
ment rate over the next few years was a touch smaller 
than in the previous forecast. 

The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation from 
2018 to 2020 was not revised materially.  Total consumer 
price inflation over the first half of 2018 appeared to be 
a little lower than in the previous projection, mainly be-
cause of slightly softer incoming data on nonmarket 
prices, but the forecast for the second half of the year 
was a little higher, reflecting an upward revision to pro-
jected consumer energy prices over the next couple of 
quarters.  The staff continued to project that total PCE 
inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective over the medium term and that core PCE price 
inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation

over that period because of a projected decline in con-
sumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as balanced.  On the upside, 
recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex-
pansion in economic activity over the next few years 
than the staff projected.  On the downside, those fiscal 
policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy 
than the staff expected if, for example, the marginal pro-
pensities to consume for groups most affected by the tax 
cuts are lower than the staff had assumed.  Risks to the 
inflation projection also were seen as balanced.  The up-
side risk that inflation could increase more than expected 
in an economy that was projected to move further above 
its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk 
that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower 
than was assumed in the staff forecast. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Job gains 
had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the 
unemployment rate had declined.  Recent data suggested 
that growth of household spending had picked up, while 
business fixed investment had continued to grow 
strongly.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and core 
inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy 
prices, had both moved close to 2 percent.  Indicators of 
longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, 
on balance. 

Participants viewed recent readings on spending, em-
ployment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on 
balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook.  
Incoming data suggested that GDP growth strengthened 
in the second quarter of this year, as growth of consumer 
spending picked up after slowing earlier in the year.  Par-
ticipants noted a number of favorable economic factors 
that were supporting above-trend GDP growth; these 
included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax 
and spending policies, accommodative financial condi-
tions, and continued high levels of household and busi-
ness confidence.  They also generally expected that fur-
ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion 
of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, 
and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  Participants generally 
viewed the risks to the economic outlook as roughly bal-
anced. 

Participants reported that business fixed investment had 
continued to expand at a strong pace in recent months, 
supported in part by substantial investment growth in 
the energy sector.  Higher oil prices were expected to 
continue to support investment in that sector, and Dis-
trict contacts in the industry were generally upbeat, 
though supply constraints for labor and infrastructure 
were reportedly limiting expansion plans.  By contrast, 
District reports regarding the construction sector were 
mixed, although here, too, some contacts reported that 
supply constraints were acting as a drag on activity.  Con-
ditions in both the manufacturing and service sectors in 
several Districts were reportedly strong and were seen as 
contributing to solid investment gains.  However, many 
District contacts expressed concern about the possible 
adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade re-
strictions, both domestically and abroad, on future in-
vestment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated 
that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or 
postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.  
Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected 
higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products 
but had not planned any new investments to increase ca-
pacity.  Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly 
improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about 
the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports. 

Participants agreed that labor market conditions 
strengthened further over the intermeeting period.  
Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in re-
cent months, averaging more than 200,000 per month 
this year.  The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in

May, below the estimate of each participant who submit-
ted a longer-run projection.  Participants pointed to 
other indicators such as a very high rate of job openings 
and an elevated quits rate as additional signs that labor 
market conditions were strong.  With economic growth 
anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally 
expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or de-
cline further below, their estimates of its longer-run nor-
mal rate.  Several participants, however, suggested that 
there may be less tightness in the labor market than im-
plied by the unemployment rate alone, because there was 
further scope for a strong labor market to continue to 
draw individuals into the workforce. 

Contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding 
qualified workers, and, in some cases, firms were coping 
with labor shortages by increasing salaries and benefits 
in order to attract or retain workers.  Other business 
contacts facing labor shortages were responding by in-
creasing training for less-qualified workers or by invest-
ing in automation.  On balance, for the economy overall, 
recent data on average hourly earnings indicated that 
wage increases remained moderate.  A number of partic-
ipants noted that, with the unemployment rate expected 
to remain below estimates of its longer-run normal rate, 
they anticipated wage inflation to pick up further. 

Participants noted that the 12-month changes in both 
overall and core PCE prices had recently moved close to 
2 percent.  The recent large increases in consumer en-
ergy prices had pushed up total PCE price inflation rel-
ative to the core measure, and this divergence was ex-
pected to continue in the near term, resulting in a tem-
porary increase in overall inflation above the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  In general, partici-
pants viewed recent price developments as consistent 
with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory 
to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive on a sustained basis, although a number of partici-
pants noted that it was premature to conclude that the 
Committee had achieved that objective.  The generally 
favorable outlook for inflation was buttressed by reports 
from business contacts in several Districts suggesting 
some firming of inflationary pressures; for example, 
many business contacts indicated that they were experi-
encing rising input costs, and, in some cases, firms ap-
peared to be passing these cost increases through to con-
sumer prices.  Although core inflation and the 12-month 
trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 
2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels 
of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations 

would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the me-
dium term.  In light of inflation having run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective for the past several 
years, a few participants cautioned that measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations derived from financial 
market data remained somewhat below levels consistent 
with the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Accordingly, 
in their view, investors appeared to judge the expected 
path of inflation as running a bit below 2 percent over 
the medium run.  Some participants raised the concern 
that a prolonged period in which the economy operated 
beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflation-
ary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead 
eventually to a significant economic downturn.   

Participants commented on a number of risks and un-
certainties associated with their outlook for economic 
activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium 
term.  Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks 
associated with trade policy had intensified and were 
concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually 
could have negative effects on business sentiment and 
investment spending.  Participants generally continued 
to see recent fiscal policy changes as supportive of eco-
nomic growth over the next few years, and a few indi-
cated that fiscal policy posed an upside risk.  A few par-
ticipants raised the concern that fiscal policy is not cur-
rently on a sustainable path.  Many participants saw po-
tential downside risks to economic growth and inflation 
associated with political and economic developments in 
Europe and some EMEs. 

Meeting participants also discussed the term structure of 
interest rates and what a flattening of the yield curve 
might signal about economic activity going forward.  
Participants pointed to a number of factors, other than 
the gradual rise of the federal funds rate, that could con-
tribute to a reduction in the spread between long-term 
and short-term Treasury yields, including a reduction in 
investors’ estimates of the longer-run neutral real inter-
est rate; lower longer-term inflation expectations; or a 
lower level of term premiums in recent years relative to 
historical experience reflecting, in part, central bank as-
set purchases.  Some participants noted that such factors 
might temper the reliability of the slope of the yield 
curve as an indicator of future economic activity; how-
ever, several others expressed doubt about whether such 
factors were distorting the information content of the 
yield curve.  A number of participants thought it would 
be important to continue to monitor the slope of the 
yield curve, given the historical regularity that an in-
verted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of re-
cession in the United States.  Participants also discussed

a staff presentation of an indicator of the likelihood of 
recession based on the spread between the current level 
of the federal funds rate and the expected federal funds 
rate several quarters ahead derived from futures market 
prices.  The staff noted that this measure may be less 
affected by many of the factors that have contributed to 
the flattening of the yield curve, such as depressed term 
premiums at longer horizons.  Several participants cau-
tioned that yield curve movements should be interpreted 
within the broader context of financial conditions and 
the outlook, and would be only one among many con-
siderations in forming an assessment of appropriate pol-
icy. 

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants generally agreed that the economic expan-
sion was progressing roughly as anticipated, with real 
economic activity expanding at a solid rate, labor market 
conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near 
the Committee’s objective.  Based on their current as-
sessments, almost all participants expressed the view 
that it would be appropriate for the Committee to con-
tinue its gradual approach to policy firming by raising the 
target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at 
this meeting.  These participants agreed that, even after 
such an increase in the target range, the stance of mon-
etary policy would remain accommodative, supporting 
strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 
2 percent inflation.  One participant remarked that, with 
inflation having run consistently below 2 percent in re-
cent years and market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation still low, postponing an increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate would help push infla-
tion expectations up to levels consistent with the Com-
mittee’s objective. 

With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary 
policy, participants generally judged that, with the econ-
omy already very strong and inflation expected to run at 
2 percent on a sustained basis over the medium term, it 
would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising 
the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that 
was at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer-
run level by 2019 or 2020.  Participants reaffirmed that 
adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend 
on their assessments of the evolution of the economic 
outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the Commit-
tee’s statutory objectives. 

Participants pointed to various reasons for raising short-
term interest rates gradually, including the uncertainty 
surrounding the level of the federal funds rate in the 

longer run, the lags with which changes in monetary pol-
icy affect the economy, and the potential constraints on 
adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate 
in response to adverse shocks when short-term interest 
rates are low.  In addition, a few participants saw survey- 
or market-based indicators as suggesting that inflation 
expectations were not yet firmly anchored at a level con-
sistent with the Committee’s objective.  A few also noted 
that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 
2 percent could be helpful in anchoring longer-run infla-
tion expectations at a level consistent with the Commit-
tee’s symmetric objective. 

Participants offered their views about how much addi-
tional policy firming would likely be required to sustain-
ably achieve the Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  Many noted that, 
if gradual increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate continued, the federal funds rate could be at 
or above their estimates of its neutral level sometime 
next year.  In that regard, participants discussed how the 
Committee’s communications might evolve over com-
ing meetings if the economy progressed about as antici-
pated; in particular, a number of them noted that it might 
soon be appropriate to modify the language in the 
postmeeting statement indicating that “the stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative.” 

Participants supported a plan to implement a technical 
adjustment to the IOER rate that would place it at a level 
5 basis points below the top of the FOMC’s target range 
for the federal funds rate.  A few participants suggested 
that, before too long, the Committee might want to fur-
ther discuss how it can implement monetary policy most 
effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve 
balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen re-
cently. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market 
had continued to strengthen and that economic activity 
had been rising at a solid rate.  Job gains had been strong, 
on average, in recent months, and the unemployment 
rate had declined.  Recent data suggested that growth of 
household spending had picked up, while business fixed 
investment had continued to grow strongly.  On a  
12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for 
items other than food and energy had moved close to 
2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed, on balance.

Members viewed the recent data as consistent with a 
strong economy that was evolving about as they had ex-
pected.  They judged that continuing along a path of 
gradual policy firming would balance the risk of moving 
too quickly, which could leave inflation short of a sus-
tained return to the Committee’s symmetric goal, against 
the risk of moving too slowly, which could lead to a 
buildup of inflation pressures or material financial im-
balances.  Consequently, members expected that further 
gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds 
rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective over the medium term.  Members continued to 
judge that the risks to the economic outlook remained 
roughly balanced. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate to 1¾ to 2 percent.  They indicated that the stance 
of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus-
tained return to 2 percent inflation. 

Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
would depend upon their assessment of realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
maximum employment objective and symmetric 2 per-
cent inflation objective.  They reiterated that this assess-
ment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members fa-
vored the removal of the forward-guidance language 
stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for 
some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.”  Members noted that, although this  
forward-guidance language had been useful for com-
municating the expected path of the federal funds rate 
during the early stages of policy normalization, this lan-
guage was no longer appropriate in light of the strong 
state of the economy and the current expected path for 
policy.  Moreover, the removal of the forward-guidance 
language and other changes to the statement should 
streamline and facilitate the Committee’s communica-
tions.  Importantly, the changes were a reflection of the 
progress toward achieving the Committee’s statutory 

goals and did not reflect a shift in the approach to policy 
going forward. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective June 14, 2018, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 1¾ to 2 percent, including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 1.75 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per- 
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during June that 
exceeds $18 billion, and to continue reinvesting 
in agency mortgage-backed securities the 
amount of principal payments from the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities received during 
June that exceeds $12 billion.  Effective in July, 
the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at 
auction the amount of principal payments from 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury se-
curities maturing during each calendar month 
that exceeds $24 billion, and to reinvest in 
agency mortgage-backed securities the amount 
of principal payments from the Federal Re-
serve’s holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities received during 
each calendar month that exceeds $16 billion.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.”

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in May indicates that 
the labor market has continued to strengthen 
and that economic activity has been rising at a 
solid rate.  Job gains have been strong, on aver-
age, in recent months, and the unemployment 
rate has declined.  Recent data suggest that 
growth of household spending has picked up, 
while business fixed investment has continued 
to grow strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both 
overall inflation and inflation for items other 
than food and energy have moved close to 
2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation 
expectations are little changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that 
further gradual increases in the target range for 
the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective over the medium term.  Risks to the eco-
nomic outlook appear roughly balanced. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting strong labor market condi-
tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla-
tion. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 

                                                 
4 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted 
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Fran-
cisco.  This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of 
Governors of the establishment of a 2½ percent primary 
credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Bank, effective 
on the later of June 14, 2018, and the date such Reserve Bank 

information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, William C. 
Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael 
Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Randal K. Quarles, and John 
C. Williams. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances to 1.95 percent, effective 
June 14, 2018.  The Board of Governors also voted 
unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point increase 
in the primary credit rate (discount rate) to 2½ percent, 
effective June 14, 2018.4 

Election of Committee Vice Chairman 
By unanimous vote, the Committee selected John C. 
Williams to serve as Vice Chairman, effective on 
June 18, 2018, until the selection of a successor at the 
Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2019. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 31– 
August 1, 2018.  The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on 
June 13, 2018. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on May 22, 2018, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on May 1-2, 2018.

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 12–13, 2018, meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each 
year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each 
participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-
isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability. 

All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that, in 2018, real GDP would expand at a pace 
exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run 
growth rate of real GDP.  Participants generally saw real 
GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol-
lowing two years but remaining above their estimates of 
the longer-run rate.  All participants who submitted 
longer-run projections expected that, throughout the 
projection period, the unemployment rate would run be-
low their estimates of its longer-run level.  All partici-
pants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-
quarter percentage change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE), would run at or 
slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective by 
the end of 2018 and remain roughly flat through 2020.  
Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) from March, most participants slightly marked up 
their projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and some-
what lowered their projections for the unemployment 
rate from 2018 through 2020; participants indicated that 
these revisions reflected, in large part, strength in incom-
ing data.  A large majority of participants made slight up-
ward adjustments to their projections of inflation in

the time of the June 2018 meeting. 

2018.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics 
for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to 
expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in 
the federal funds rate.  The central tendencies of partic-
ipants’ projections of the federal funds rate for both 
2018 and 2019 were roughly unchanged, but the medians 
for both years were 25 basis points higher relative to 
March.  Nearly all participants who submitted longer-
run projections expected that, during part of the projec-
tion period, evolving economic conditions would make 
it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move some-
what above their estimates of its longer-run level. 

In general, participants continued to view the uncer-
tainty attached to their economic projections as broadly 
similar to the average of the past 20 years.  As in March, 
most participants judged the risks around their projec-
tions for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation to be broadly balanced. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess-
ments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.8 percent 
for this year and 2.4 percent for next year.  The median 
was 2.0 percent for 2020, a touch above the median pro-
jection of longer-run growth.  Most participants contin-
ued to cite fiscal policy as a driver of strong economic 
activity over the next couple of years.  Many participants 
also mentioned accommodative monetary policy and fi-
nancial conditions, strength in the global outlook, con-
tinued momentum in the labor market, or positive read-
ings on business and consumer sentiment as important 
factors shaping the economic outlook.  Compared with 
the March SEP, the median of participants’ projections 
for the rate of real GDP growth was 0.1 percentage 
point higher for this year and unchanged for the next 
two years. 

Almost all participants expected the unemployment rate 
to decline somewhat further over the projection period.  
The median of participants’ projections for the unem-
ployment rate was 3.6 percent for the final quarter of 
this year and 3.5 percent for the final quarters of 2019 

2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate.

and 2020.  The median of participants’ estimates of the 
longer-run unemployment rate was unchanged at 
4.5 percent.   

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer 
run.  The distribution of individual projections for real 
GDP growth this year shifted up noticeably from that in 
the March SEP.  By contrast, the distributions of pro-
jected real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 and over the 
longer run were little changed.  The distributions of in-
dividual projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 
to 2020 shifted down relative to the distributions in 
March, while the downward shift in the distribution of 
longer-run projections was very modest. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
The medians of participants’ projections for total and 
core PCE price inflation in 2018 were 2.1 percent and 
2.0 percent, respectively, and the median for each meas-
ure was 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020.  Compared with 
the March SEP, the medians of participants’ projections 
for total PCE price inflation for this year and next were 
revised up slightly.  Some participants pointed to incom-
ing data on energy prices as a reason for their upward 
revisions.  The median of participants’ forecasts for core 
PCE price inflation was up a touch for this year and un-
changed for subsequent years. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of both total and core PCE 
price inflation for 2018 shifted to the right relative to the 
distributions in March.  The distributions of projected 
inflation in 2019, 2020, and over the longer run were 
roughly unchanged.  Participants generally expected 
each measure to be at or slightly above 2 percent in 2019 
and 2020. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target—or mid-
point of the target range—for the federal funds rate at 
the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the 
longer run.  The distributions of projected policy rates 
through 2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with 
the revisions to participants’ projections of real GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  As in 
their March projections, a large majority of participants 
anticipated that evolving economic conditions would 
likely warrant the equivalent of a total of either three or 
four increases of 25 basis points in the target range for 

the federal funds rate over 2018.  There was a slight re-
duction in the dispersion of participants’ views, with no 
participant regarding the appropriate target at the end of 
the year to be below 1.88 percent.  For each subsequent 
year, the dispersion of participants’ year-end projections 
was somewhat smaller than that in the March SEP. 

The medians of participants’ projections of the federal 
funds rate rose gradually to 2.4 percent at the end of this 
year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at 
the end of 2020.  The median of participants’ longer-run 
estimates, at 2.9 percent, was unchanged relative to the 
March SEP.   

In discussing their projections, many participants con-
tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory 
of the federal funds rate over the next few years would 
likely involve gradual increases.  This view was predi-
cated on several factors, including a judgment that a 
gradual path of policy firming likely would appropriately 
balance the risks associated with, among other consider-
ations, the possibilities that U.S. fiscal policy could have 
larger or more persistent positive effects on real activity 
and that shifts in trade policy or developments abroad 
could weigh on the expansion.  As always, the appropri-
ate path of the federal funds rate would depend on 
evolving economic conditions and their implications for 
participants’ economic outlooks and assessments of 
risks. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
In assessing the path for the federal funds rate that, in 
their view, is likely to be appropriate, FOMC participants 
take account of the range of possible economic out-
comes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the poten-
tial benefits and costs should they occur.  As a reference, 
table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based 
on the forecast errors of various private and government 
forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation.  
Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan 
charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  The fan charts display the median SEP projections 
for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confi-
dence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported 
in table 2.  If the degree of uncertainty attending these 
projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past 
forecast errors and the risks around the projections are 
broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these varia-
bles would have about a 70 percent probability of being 
within these confidence intervals.  For all three variables, 
this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally 
increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root

leased in the summer by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His-
torical Forecasting Errors:  The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance 
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), www.federal  
reserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017020pap.pdf. 

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth 
quarter basis. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the 
fourth quarter. 

 
Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer-
tainty attached to their economic projections for real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as 
broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, a view 
that was essentially unchanged from March.3 

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec-
tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants judged the 
risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the  
unemployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as 

                                                 
3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur-
rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach 

broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent 
with a symmetric fan chart.  Compared with March, even 
more participants saw the risks to their projections as 
broadly balanced.  Specifically, for GDP growth, only 
one participant viewed the risks as tilted to the downside, 
and the number of participants who viewed the risks as 
tilted to the upside dropped from four to two.  For the 
unemployment rate, the number of participants who saw 
the risks as tilted toward low readings dropped from four 
to two.  For inflation, all but one participant judged the 
risks to either total or core PCE price inflation as broadly 
balanced.   

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
projections, several participants continued to point to 
fiscal developments as a source of upside risk, many par-
ticipants cited developments related to trade policy as 
posing downside risks to their growth forecasts, and a 
few participants also pointed to political developments 
in Europe or the global outlook more generally as down-
side-risk factors.  A few participants noted that the ap-
preciation of the dollar posed downside risks to the in-
flation outlook.  A few participants also noted the risk 
of inflation moving higher than anticipated as the unem-
ployment rate falls. 

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate were also subject to considera-
ble uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the fed-
eral funds rate in response to actual and prospective de-
velopments over time in real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the 
projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re-
flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco-
nomic variables.  Figure 5 provides a graphical represen-
tation of this uncertainty, plotting the median SEP pro-
jection for the federal funds rate surrounded by confi-
dence intervals derived from the results presented in ta-
ble 2.  As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast 
uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the fed-
eral funds rate is substantial and increases for longer ho-
rizons.

pants’ projections.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the 
third year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence inter-
vals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the 
current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third 
years.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence 
bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on 
the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  However, in 
some instances, the risks around the projections may not be 
symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be 
negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projec-
tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in 
which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet-
rically positioned around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
