Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets, including recent monetary policy 
actions of foreign central banks and the expectations of 
market participants for the trajectory of U.S. monetary 
policy.  The deputy manager followed with a briefing on 
money market developments and System open market 
operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during 
the period since the Committee met on January 26–27, 
2016.  Experience during the intermeeting period con-
tinued to suggest that the operational framework for

monetary policy implementation was effective in main-
taining control over the federal funds rate.  Also, the 
transitions in early March to the FR 2420 reporting form 
(Report of Selected Money Market Rates) as the under-
lying source of data for computing the effective federal 
funds rate, and to a volume-weighted median as the cal-
culation method, proceeded smoothly.  In addition, the 
deputy manager reviewed recent and projected trends in 
foreign portfolio income of the SOMA, including the 
implications for portfolio income of foreign nominal in-
terest rates that were very low, even negative. 

The deputy manager also outlined factors that the Com-
mittee might consider in determining whether to offer 
term reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) over the end 
of the first quarter.  In the ensuing discussion of this 
question among Committee participants, it was noted 
that, in view of the very elevated capacity of the over-
night (ON) RRP facility that would remain available for 
the time being, offering term RRPs in addition to ON 
RRPs would be unlikely to enhance control of the fed-
eral funds rate over quarter-end, and offering term RRPs 
at an interest rate spread over ON RRPs could margin-
ally increase the Federal Reserve’s interest costs.  For 
these reasons, Committee participants generally pre-
ferred not to offer term RRPs over the end of the first 
quarter.  Participants noted that it may be appropriate to 
offer term RRPs at some point in the future after the 
Committee reintroduces an aggregate cap on ON RRP 
operations, and the Committee’s decisions regarding 
term RRPs over quarter-ends had no implications for 
the FOMC’s plan to phase out the ON RRP facility 
when it was no longer needed to help control the federal 
funds rate. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account over the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the March 15–16 meeting 
suggested that labor market conditions were continuing 
to improve in the first quarter, and that the pace of ex-
pansion in real gross domestic product (GDP) was pick-
ing up somewhat from the previous quarter.  Consumer 
price inflation was still running below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by 
decreases in both consumer energy prices and the prices 
of non-energy imports.  Survey-based measures of

longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on 
balance, in recent months, while market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remained low. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in January 
and February at a solid average monthly pace.  The un-
employment rate declined to 4.9 percent in January and 
remained at that level in February, while both the labor 
force participation rate and the employment-to-popula-
tion ratio increased over these months.  The share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons edged 
down in January and February.  The rates of private-sec-
tor job openings, hires, and quits rose a little in Decem-
ber.  The four-week moving average of initial claims for 
unemployment insurance benefits moved down in Feb-
ruary and early March after increasing a little in January.  
Labor compensation continued to rise at a modest pace.  
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
increased 2½ percent over the four quarters of 2015, and 
the employment cost index rose nearly 2 percent over 
the 12 months ending in December; both increases were 
similar to their averages in recent years.  Average hourly 
earnings for all employees increased 2¼ percent over the 
12 months ending in February, about ¼ percentage 
point more than over the preceding 12 months. 

Industrial production increased in January.  Manufactur-
ing output rose, reversing the declines seen in the two 
previous months, and the output of utilities moved up 
sharply as the demand for heating rebounded after hav-
ing been held down by unseasonably warm weather in 
December.  Mining output was unchanged following 
four months of sizable declines that resulted from de-
creases in drilling activity.  Automakers’ assembly sched-
ules and broader indicators of manufacturing produc-
tion, such as the readings on new orders from national 
and regional manufacturing surveys, mostly pointed to a 
modest pace of gains in factory output over the next few 
months.  Information on drilling activity for crude oil 
and natural gas through early March was consistent with 
further declines in mining output. 

Growth in real personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) appeared to pick up some in the first quarter.  The 
components of the nominal retail sales data used by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate 
of PCE were little changed, on net, in January and Feb-
ruary, but spending on energy services appeared likely to 
increase somewhat and the rate of sales of new light mo-
tor vehicles stepped up following a decline in December.  
Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer 
spending generally pointed toward solid growth in real 

PCE over the first half of the year.  Gains in real dispos-
able income picked up in December and January.  
Households’ net worth was supported both by a re-
bound in equity prices following declines earlier in the 
year and by further increases in home values through 
January.  Also, consumer sentiment in the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained at an elevated 
level in February. 

Recent information on housing activity was consistent 
with a continued gradual recovery in this sector.  Starts 
for new single-family homes moved higher, on balance, 
in January and February, and building permits were little 
changed.  Starts of multifamily units declined on net.  
New home sales fell in January, more than reversing an 
increase in December.  Sales of existing homes increased 
further in January following a strong gain in December. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property products appeared to be increasing 
only modestly in the first quarter.  Nominal shipments 
of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined 
in January, and forward-looking indicators of equipment 
spending, such as new orders for nondefense capital 
goods along with recent readings from national and re-
gional surveys of business conditions, were generally 
soft.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential struc-
tures excluding drilling and mining increased somewhat 
in January after having declined for two months.  Indi-
cators of spending for structures in the drilling and min-
ing sector, such as the number of oil and gas rigs in op-
eration, continued to fall through early March.  The lim-
ited available data suggested that inventory investment 
continued to decline in the early part of the year.  None-
theless, with the exception of the energy sector, inven-
tories generally seemed well aligned with the pace of 
sales. 

Growth in total real government purchases appeared to 
be modest in the first quarter.  Federal government 
spending for defense was soft in January and February, 
while nondefense spending seemed likely to be slightly 
boosted early in the year by the effect of the 2015 Bipar-
tisan Budget Act.  Nominal construction spending by 
state and local governments increased sharply in January, 
but the payrolls of these governments were little 
changed, on net, over the first two months of the year. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in both De-
cember and January, as exports declined in both months, 
continuing a downward trend that began in late 2014, 
with particular weakness in exports of capital goods.  Im-
ports rose slightly in December before falling back in 
January.  Net exports subtracted from real GDP growth

in the fourth quarter, and the January trade data sug-
gested that net exports would continue to weigh on 
growth in the first quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices as measured by the PCE 
price index increased 1¼ percent over the 12 months 
ending in January, partly restrained by declines in con-
sumer energy prices.  Core PCE price inflation, which 
excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¾ per-
cent over the same 12-month period, held down in part 
by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports and the 
pass-through of declines in energy prices.  Over the 
12 months ending in February, total consumer prices as 
measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1 per-
cent, while core CPI inflation was around 2¼ percent.  
Both readings on core inflation were boosted, in part, by 
movements in prices for some categories of goods and 
services whose prices tend to be volatile.  Survey 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations—includ-
ing those from the Michigan survey, Blue Chip Eco-
nomic Indicators, Survey of Professional Forecasters, 
Survey of Primary Dealers, and Survey of Market Partic-
ipants—were generally little changed on balance.  In 
February, the Michigan survey measure of median infla-
tion expectations over the next 5 to 10 years was below 
its typical range of the past 15 years, likely reflecting—at 
least in part—decreases in energy prices over the past 
year and a half.   

Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the fourth quarter, 
with Canadian activity restrained by declines in oil- 
related investment and the Japanese economy contract-
ing amid weakness in consumption.  Economic growth 
continued to be steady but modest in the euro area and 
the United Kingdom, while Brazil remained in recession.  
In contrast, some economies in emerging Asia recorded 
robust growth.  Indicators pointed to a pickup in growth 
in most foreign economies in the current quarter but to 
a further softening of growth in China.  Inflation in the 
advanced foreign economies remained low.  In contrast, 
inflation rose in China because of a rebound in local 
food prices, while inflation in much of South America 
remained elevated, reflecting weaker currencies.  Con-
cerns about persistently low inflation spurred further 
monetary policy accommodation by the Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB). 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Financial markets were turbulent over the first month 
and a half of the year, apparently reflecting investors’ 
concerns about global growth prospects and associated 
risks to the U.S. outlook.  However, these concerns ap-

peared to diminish beginning in mid-February, and do-
mestic financial conditions generally eased, on balance, 
since the January FOMC meeting:  Stock prices rose, eq-
uity price volatility declined, and credit spreads on cor-
porate bonds narrowed.  The dollar depreciated against 
most foreign currencies, and long-term sovereign bond 
yields declined amid easing by central banks in advanced 
foreign economies. 

Yields on 5- and 10-year nominal Treasury securities de-
clined at the outset of the intermeeting period, reflecting 
the continued pullback from risky assets that began early 
in the year on concerns about prospects for global eco-
nomic growth.  These yields subsequently increased as 
market sentiment improved and were little changed, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period.  Measures of in-
flation compensation over the next 5 years rose, on net, 
consistent with increases in oil prices, while inflation 
compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed on 
the period and remained at the lower end of its historical 
range. 

After becoming considerably flatter early in the inter-
meeting period, the path of the federal funds rate im-
plied by market quotes on interest rate derivatives steep-
ened subsequently as financial market conditions im-
proved and was little changed, on balance, over the in-
termeeting period.  However, the median respondent to 
the Desk’s March Survey of Primary Dealers and to the 
Survey of Market Participants expected only two in-
creases in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds 
rate this year, one fewer than they had projected in Jan-
uary. 

Broad equity market indexes increased, on balance, over 
the intermeeting period and continued to exhibit a high 
correlation with crude oil prices.  Reflecting the im-
provement in investor sentiment that started in mid-
February, corporate bond spreads narrowed, with 
spreads on investment-grade issues finishing the period 
slightly lower while spreads on speculative-grade is-
sues—particularly those for the lowest-rated bonds—
declined appreciably. 

Financing conditions for investment-grade nonfinancial 
firms continued to be relatively accommodative.  Cor-
porate bond issuance by these firms was robust in Janu-
ary and February, while speculative-grade bond issuance 
stayed subdued.  Commercial and industrial loan growth 
at banks was also strong, mostly driven by the origina-
tion of large loans to investment-grade borrowers.  Re-
financings of institutional leveraged loans were near zero 
in February, as was equity issuance through initial public 
offerings. 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

The credit quality of speculative-grade nonfinancial cor-
porations continued to show signs of deterioration.  
Market analysts’ earnings forecasts for speculative-grade 
companies, including those outside the energy sector, 
were revised down for the first quarter of 2016 amid 
concerns about a deterioration in the global economic 
outlook.  In the broader corporate bond market, the vol-
ume of downgrades of ratings outpaced that of up-
grades, even for investment-grade securities, in January 
and February, with energy firms accounting for most of 
the downgrades in February.  The default rate on nonfi-
nancial bonds remained somewhat elevated compared 
with typical levels outside recession periods. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
tightened somewhat over the intermeeting period but re-
mained accommodative.  Spreads on commercial mort-
gage-backed securities (CMBS) continued to widen, on 
net, despite the narrowing of spreads in broader bond 
markets.  Reportedly in response, CMBS issuance was 
down somewhat over the first two months of the year, 
although CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets continued 
to increase at a robust pace through February. 

Lending conditions in residential real estate markets 
were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting 
period.  Financing conditions in consumer credit mar-
kets generally remained accommodative, and outstand-
ing student and auto debt continued to grow at a robust 
pace. 

During the intermeeting period, foreign financial condi-
tions improved on net.  After deteriorating further early 
in the period, foreign equity prices bounced back and 
credit spreads on emerging market bonds narrowed, in 
both cases returning to December levels in most coun-
tries.  Since the January FOMC meeting, the dollar de-
preciated, on net, against most foreign currencies.  Long-
term sovereign bond yields declined notably in the ad-
vanced economies, in part as foreign central banks an-
nounced additional monetary policy easing measures.  
The BOJ introduced a negative deposit rate.  The ECB 
announced a comprehensive package of easing 
measures, including a further cut in benchmark policy 
rates, accelerated and more expansive asset purchases, 
and a new round of targeted long-term refinancing op-
erations. 

Over the period since mid-December, when the Com-
mittee raised the target range for the federal funds rate 
¼ percentage point, U.S. financial market conditions 
had registered relatively small changes, on balance, amid 
significant volatility.  Financial derivatives suggested that 

market participants had revised down their expected tra-
jectory of the federal funds rate somewhat, and yields on 
medium- and longer-term Treasury securities declined 
20 to 30 basis points.  Yields on investment- and specu-
lative-grade corporate bonds were down slightly less, 
leaving spreads over Treasury securities little changed 
over the period between mid-December and mid-
March.  Similarly, broad equity price indexes ended this 
interval only a bit lower, and one-month-ahead option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, the VIX, de-
clined on balance.  The broad index of the foreign ex-
change value of the dollar was also roughly unchanged, 
on net, since the December meeting.   

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for 
the March FOMC meeting, real GDP in the first half of 
the year was projected to increase a little more slowly 
than in the forecast prepared for the January meeting, 
although estimated real GDP growth in the fourth quar-
ter of last year was revised up.  Beyond the near term, 
real GDP was expected to increase slightly faster than in 
the previous forecast, largely reflecting a somewhat 
higher projected path for equity prices and a lower as-
sumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar.  The staff continued to project that real GDP 
would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential 
output in 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by in-
creases in consumer spending.  The unemployment rate 
was expected to gradually decline further and to run 
somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run 
natural rate over this period; the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation over the first half of the 
year was revised up somewhat, reflecting recent in-
creases in the price of crude oil as well as stronger-than-
expected data on core consumer prices early in the year.  
The staff continued to project that inflation would in-
crease gradually over the next several years, as energy 
prices and the prices of non-energy imported goods 
were expected to begin steadily rising later this year.  Be-
yond 2016, the forecast was a bit lower than the previous 
projection, primarily reflecting a flatter expected path for 
crude oil prices.  As a result, inflation was projected still 
to be slightly below the Committee’s longer-run objec-
tive of 2 percent in 2018. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its March pro-
jections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation as similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP were 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2016 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s as-
sessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well 
positioned to help the economy withstand substantial 
adverse shocks; in addition, global economic prospects 
were still seen as an important downside risk to the fore-
cast.  Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate de-
mand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the 
unemployment rate as skewed to the upside.  The risks 
to the projection for inflation were still seen as weighted 
to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-
term inflation expectations may have edged down, and 
that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise 
substantially, which would put additional downward 
pressure on inflation. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-
flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 
2016 through 2018 and over the longer run.  Each par-
ticipant’s projections were conditioned on his or her 
judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  The longer-
run projections represent each participant’s assessment 
of the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  
These projections and policy assessments are described 
in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an 
addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants viewed the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as suggesting that 
economic activity had been expanding moderately de-
spite the global economic and financial developments of 
recent months.  Household spending had been increas-
ing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector had im-
proved further; however, business fixed investment and 
net exports had been soft.  A range of labor market in-
dicators, including strong employment growth and rising 
labor force participation, pointed to a further strength-
ening of the labor market.  Participants generally saw the 
data on economic activity and labor market conditions 
as broadly consistent with their earlier expectations.  In-
flation picked up in recent months, but it continued to 
run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objec-
tive.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation 
remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations were little changed, on bal-
ance, in recent months.  Early in the intermeeting period, 

concerns among investors about the global economic 
outlook appeared to trigger a sharp reduction in their 
risk-taking.  Financial conditions deteriorated, with eq-
uity prices falling and credit spreads on riskier corporate 
bonds widening.  Subsequently, investor sentiment re-
bounded, and domestic and global financial conditions 
eased on net over the intermeeting period. 

With respect to the outlook for economic activity and 
the labor market, participants shared the assessment 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, real GDP would continue to increase at a mod-
erate rate over the medium term and labor market indi-
cators would continue to strengthen.  Participants ob-
served that strong job gains in recent months had re-
duced concerns about a possible slowing of progress in 
the labor market.  Many participants, however, antici-
pated that relative strength in household spending would 
be partially offset by weakness in net exports associated 
with lackluster foreign growth and the appreciation of 
the dollar since mid-2014.  In addition, business fixed 
investment seemed likely to remain sluggish.  Further-
more, participants generally saw global economic and fi-
nancial developments as continuing to pose risks to the 
outlook for economic activity and the labor market in 
the United States.  In particular, several participants ex-
pressed the view that the underlying factors abroad that 
led to a sharp, though temporary, deterioration in global 
financial conditions earlier this year had not been fully 
resolved and thus posed ongoing downside risks.  Sev-
eral participants also noted the possibility that economic 
activity or labor market conditions could turn out to be 
stronger than anticipated.  For example, strong expan-
sion of household demand could result in rapid employ-
ment growth and overly tight resource utilization, partic-
ularly if productivity gains remained sluggish. 

Notwithstanding the downward revisions to recent retail 
sales data, participants were encouraged by the moderate 
average growth of consumer spending over recent quar-
ters.  Continued increases in household spending had 
buoyed growth of overall aggregate demand despite the 
volatility in financial markets.  Among the various cate-
gories of household spending, participants noted that 
motor vehicle sales remained particularly strong, albeit 
with some support from price discounting and other in-
centives.  Looking ahead, participants generally expected 
consumer spending to continue to rise moderately.  Solid 
gains in employment and income, the relatively high ra-
tio of household wealth to income, low gasoline prices, 
and a high level of consumer confidence were seen as 
factors that should contribute to moderate growth in 
consumer spending.

Reports on the housing sector were mixed, with some 
participants noting a weakening of housing activity in re-
gions adversely affected by the decline in energy prices.  
Nonetheless, fundamentals for housing activity were 
seen as strong except for a reported shortage of builda-
ble lots in some areas.  Some participants reported that 
contacts were generally upbeat about the outlook for 
housing construction in their Districts, and participants 
anticipated that activity in the housing sector would con-
tinue to expand this year. 

In contrast, several participants noted recent softness in 
business fixed investment and signs that the sluggish 
growth would continue.  Orders and shipments for non-
defense capital goods had been about flat.  Capital ex-
penditures continued to be depressed by the contraction 
in the energy sector.  Capital spending plans appeared to 
remain soft.  The possible adverse effects on investment 
spending of concerns about global growth and the asso-
ciated volatility in financial markets were also noted.  
District reports on commercial construction activity, 
however, were generally positive. 

With regard to the external sector, a number of partici-
pants said that they expected declines in net exports to 
continue to subtract from real GDP growth, reflecting 
weak foreign activity as well as the earlier appreciation 
of the dollar.  The outlook for growth abroad had 
dimmed in recent months, suggesting a more persistent 
drag on growth of U.S. exports.  A couple of participants 
commented that emerging market economies faced an 
extended period of less rapid export growth, reflecting 
slower economic growth in many advanced foreign 
economies and in China.  It also was noted that weak 
growth abroad could lead to further appreciation of the 
dollar. 

In discussing domestic business conditions, several par-
ticipants noted that their contacts saw rising sales in the 
retail sector and that reports from firms in the services 
sector were mostly strong.  In some Districts, surveys 
suggested that manufacturing activity had bottomed out.  
However, a number of participants commented that pre-
vious declines in commodity and energy prices, along 
with the earlier appreciation of the dollar and weak for-
eign activity, continued to weigh on manufacturing ac-
tivity.  A few participants also noted that such factors 
were reducing farm incomes in their Districts. 

During the intermeeting period, the labor market 
strengthened further.  In their comments on labor mar-
ket conditions, participants cited strong payroll gains and 
a further tick down in the civilian unemployment rate.  
Broader measures of labor force underutilization had 

also shown progress, including an increase in labor force 
participation.  The quits rate had returned to its pre- 
recession level, as had households’ perceptions of job 
availability and firms’ assessments of the difficulty of fill-
ing jobs, providing further evidence of improved labor 
market conditions.  Some participants judged that cur-
rent labor market conditions were at or near those con-
sistent with maximum sustainable employment, noting 
that the unemployment rate was at or below their esti-
mates of its longer-run normal level and citing anecdotal 
reports of labor shortages or increased wage pressures.  
In contrast, some other participants judged that the 
economy had not yet reached maximum employment.  
They noted several indicators other than the unemploy-
ment rate that pointed to remaining underutilization of 
labor resources; these indicators included the still-high 
rate of involuntary part-time employment and the low 
level of the employment-to-population ratio for prime-
age workers.  The surprisingly limited extent to which 
aggregate data indicated upward pressure on wage 
growth also suggested some remaining slack in labor 
markets. 

Participants commented on the recent increase in infla-
tion.  Some participants saw the increase as consistent 
with a firming trend in inflation.  Some others, however, 
expressed the view that the increase was unlikely to be 
sustained, in part because it appeared to reflect, to an 
appreciable degree, increases in prices that had been rel-
atively volatile in the past.  Participants continued to an-
ticipate that inflation would run below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective in the near term but that, as the tran-
sitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import 
prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened fur-
ther, inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Several participants indicated that the persistence 
of global disinflationary pressures or the possibility that 
inflation expectations were moving lower continued to 
pose downside risks to the inflation outlook.  A few oth-
ers expressed the view that there were also risks that 
could lead to inflation running higher than anticipated; 
for example, overly tight resource utilization could push 
inflation above the Committee’s 2 percent goal, particu-
larly if productivity gains remained sluggish. 

Participants discussed readings from various market- 
and survey-based measures of longer-run inflation ex-
pectations.  Some survey-based measures had edged 
down, while others had remained stable and one had 
edged up; such measures were little changed, on balance, 
in recent months.  The market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation that had declined earlier were still at 
low levels.  Several participants noted that some of the

softness in the market-based measures likely reflected 
changes in risk and liquidity premiums, and that some of 
the survey-based measures appeared to be excessively 
sensitive to movements in gasoline prices.  Some partic-
ipants concluded that longer-run inflation expectations 
remained reasonably stable, but some others expressed 
concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have 
already moved lower, or that they might do so if inflation 
was to persist for much longer at a rate below the Com-
mittee’s objective. 

Participants discussed the implications of the global eco-
nomic and financial developments of the past few 
months for the medium-term outlook, and they offered 
different characterizations of the risks to the U.S. econ-
omy stemming from these developments.  Many partic-
ipants expressed a view that the global economic and fi-
nancial situation still posed appreciable downside risks 
to the domestic economic outlook.  Some noted that re-
cent financial market turbulence provided an important 
reminder that the ability of central banks to offset the 
effects of adverse economic shocks might be limited, 
particularly by the low level of policy interest rates in 
most advanced economies.  In contrast, a few noted that 
the actions taken by several foreign central banks in re-
cent weeks to increase monetary accommodation likely 
had helped mitigate downside risks to the global out-
look.  Nonetheless, many participants indicated that the 
heightened global risks and the asymmetric ability of 
monetary policy to respond to them warranted caution 
in making adjustments to the stance of U.S. monetary 
policy. 

Participants generally agreed that the incoming infor-
mation indicated that the U.S. economy had been resili-
ent to recent global economic and financial develop-
ments, and that the domestic economic indicators that 
had become available in recent weeks had been mostly 
consistent with their expectations.  Moreover, the sharp 
asset price movements that occurred earlier in the year 
had been reversed to a large extent, but longer-term in-
terest rates and market participants’ expectations for the 
future path of the federal funds rate remained lower.  
Taking these developments into account, participants 
generally judged that the medium-term outlook for do-
mestic demand was not appreciably different than it had 
been when the Committee met in December.  However, 
most participants, while recognizing the likely positive 
effects of recent policy actions abroad, saw foreign eco-
nomic growth as likely to run at a somewhat slower pace 
than previously expected, a development that probably 
would further restrain growth in U.S. exports and tend 
to damp overall aggregate demand.  Several participants 

also cited wider credit spreads as a factor that was likely 
to restrain growth in demand.  Accordingly, many par-
ticipants expressed the view that a somewhat lower path 
for the federal funds rate than they had projected in De-
cember now seemed most likely to be appropriate for 
achieving the Committee’s dual mandate.  Many partici-
pants also noted that a somewhat lower projected inter-
est rate path was one reason for the relatively small revi-
sions in their medium-term projections for economic ac-
tivity, unemployment, and inflation. 

Several participants also argued for proceeding cau-
tiously in reducing policy accommodation because they 
saw the risks to the U.S. economy stemming from devel-
opments abroad as tilted to the downside or because 
they were concerned that longer-term inflation expecta-
tions might be slipping lower, skewing the risks to the 
outlook for inflation to the downside.  Many participants 
noted that, with the target range for the federal funds 
rate only slightly above zero, the FOMC continued to 
have little room to ease monetary policy through con-
ventional means if economic activity or inflation turned 
out to be materially weaker than anticipated, but could 
raise rates quickly if the economy appeared to be over-
heating or if inflation was to increase significantly more 
rapidly than anticipated.  In their view, this asymmetry 
made it prudent to wait for additional information re-
garding the underlying strength of economic activity and 
prospects for inflation before taking another step to re-
duce policy accommodation. 

For all of these reasons, most participants judged it ap-
propriate to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting while noting 
that global economic and financial developments con-
tinued to pose risks.  These participants saw their judg-
ment as consistent with the Committee’s data-depend-
ent approach to setting monetary policy; it was noted 
that, in this context, the relevant data include not only 
domestic economic releases, but also information about 
developments abroad and changes in financial condi-
tions that bear on the economic outlook.  A couple of 
participants, however, saw an increase in the target range 
to ½ to ¾ percent as appropriate at this meeting, citing 
evidence that the economy was continuing to expand at 
a moderate rate despite developments abroad and earlier 
volatility in financial conditions, continued improve-
ment in labor market conditions, the firming of inflation 
over recent months, and the apparent leveling-off of oil 
prices.  In their judgment, increasing the target range for 
the federal funds rate too gradually in the near term 
risked having to raise it quickly later, which could cause 
economic and financial strains at that time.

Participants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the 
data and the implications for the outlook, rather than 
calendar dates, would determine the timing and pace of 
future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy.  
They expressed a range of views about the likelihood 
that incoming information would make an adjustment 
appropriate at the time of their next meeting.  A number 
of participants judged that the headwinds restraining 
growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest 
were likely to subside only slowly.  In light of this expec-
tation and their assessment of the risks to the economic 
outlook, several expressed the view that a cautious ap-
proach to raising rates would be prudent or noted their 
concern that raising the target range as soon as April 
would signal a sense of urgency they did not think ap-
propriate.  In contrast, some other participants indicated 
that an increase in the target range at the Committee’s 
next meeting might well be warranted if the incoming 
economic data remained consistent with their expecta-
tions for moderate growth in output, further strengthen-
ing of the labor market, and inflation rising to 2 percent 
over the medium term. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in January suggested that economic 
activity had been expanding at a moderate pace despite 
the global economic and financial developments of re-
cent months.  They also agreed that household spending 
had been increasing at a moderate rate, and that the 
housing sector had improved further; however, business 
fixed investment and net exports had been soft.  Mem-
bers saw a range of recent indicators, including strong 
job gains, as pointing to additional strengthening of the 
labor market.  Members noted that inflation had picked 
up in recent months; however, they also noted that in-
flation had continued to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines 
in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation re-
mained low.  Survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations were little changed, on balance, in 
recent months. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market indicators would continue to 
strengthen.  However, they saw global economic and fi-
nancial developments as continuing to pose risks.  Mem-
bers also continued to expect inflation to remain low in 

the near term, in part because of earlier declines in en-
ergy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and 
import prices dissipated and the labor market strength-
ened further.  Members noted the increase in inflation 
reported in recent months but expressed a range of 
views about the extent to which the increase would 
prove persistent.  Several members expressed concern 
that longer-run inflation expectations may have de-
clined.  Members agreed they would continue to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 

Against the backdrop of its discussion of current condi-
tions, the economic outlook, and the risks and uncer-
tainties surrounding the outlook, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 
¼ to ½ percent at this meeting.  This accommodative 
stance of monetary policy was expected to support fur-
ther improvement in labor market conditions and a re-
turn to 2 percent inflation.  One member, however, pre-
ferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, 
indicating that the current low level of real interest rates 
was not appropriate in the context of current economic 
conditions and the progress that had been achieved to-
ward the Committee’s objectives. 

Members again agreed that, in determining the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  
This assessment would take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor market condi-
tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments.  In light of the current shortfall of infla-
tion from 2 percent, the Committee agreed that it would 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward 
its inflation goal.  The Committee expected that eco-
nomic conditions would evolve in a manner that would 
warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, 
and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for 
some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  Indeed, several members noted that their 
current projections of the path for the federal funds rate 
that would likely be appropriate this year and next were 
lower than they had projected in December.  However, 
members agreed that future data and developments 
could lead to changes in the economic outlook and in 
their projections of appropriate monetary policy, and 
that the actual path of the federal funds rate would de-
pend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming 
data. 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2016 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term secu-
rities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommoda-
tive financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective March 17, 2016, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake 
open market operations as necessary to maintain 
the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to 
½ percent, including overnight reverse repur-
chase operations (and reverse repurchase opera-
tions with maturities of more than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or 
similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 
0.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value 
of Treasury securities held outright in the System 
Open Market Account that are available for such 
operations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue roll-
ing over maturing Treasury securities at auction 
and to continue reinvesting principal payments 
on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in January suggests that 
economic activity has been expanding at a mod-
erate pace despite the global economic and finan-
cial developments of recent months.  Household 
spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, 
and the housing sector has improved further; 

however, business fixed investment and net ex-
ports have been soft.  A range of recent indica-
tors, including strong job gains, points to addi-
tional strengthening of the labor market.  Infla-
tion picked up in recent months; however, it con-
tinued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-
ports.  Market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation remain low; survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and 
price stability.  The Committee currently expects 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand at 
a moderate pace and labor market indicators will 
continue to strengthen.  However, global eco-
nomic and financial developments continue to 
pose risks.  Inflation is expected to remain low in 
the near term, in part because of earlier declines 
in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the 
medium term as the transitory effects of declines 
in energy and import prices dissipate and the la-
bor market strengthens further.  The Committee 
continues to monitor inflation developments 
closely. 

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to 
maintain the target range for the federal funds 
rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary 
policy remains accommodative, thereby support-
ing further improvement in labor market condi-
tions and a return to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds 
rate, the Committee will assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  This assessment will take into account a 
wide range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expectations, and readings 
on financial and international developments.  In 
light of the current shortfall of inflation from 
2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation 
goal.  The Committee expects that economic con-
ditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate;

the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securities 
and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normali-
zation of the level of the federal funds rate is well 
under way.  This policy, by keeping the Commit-
tee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable 
levels, should help maintain accommodative fi-
nancial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer, 
Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, Eric Rosengren, 
and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  Esther L. George. 

Ms. George dissented because she believed that a 25 ba-
sis point increase in the target range for the federal funds 
rate was warranted at this meeting.  Although risks to the 
global economy had increased in recent months and fi-
nancial markets were unusually volatile at times, she be-
lieved that monetary policy should focus primarily on 
progress toward the Committee’s longer-run objectives.  

Recently, labor market conditions had continued to 
strengthen, with the economy apparently near full em-
ployment, and some data had suggested a firming of un-
derlying inflation trends.  She believed that monetary 
policy should respond to these developments by gradu-
ally removing accommodation.  She noted that, in such 
circumstances, postponing the removal of accommoda-
tion could increase financial distortions and risks to the 
economy and undermine the achievement of the Com-
mittee’s longer-run objectives. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors took no action to change the 
interest rates on reserves or discount rates. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 26–27, 
2016.  The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on 
March 16, 2016. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on February 16, 2016, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on January 26–27, 2016.

Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 15–16, 2016, meet-
ing participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each 
year from 2016 to 2018 and over the longer run.  Each 
participant’s projection was based on information avail-
able at the time of the meeting, together with his or her 
assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assump-
tions about the factors likely to affect economic out-
comes.  The longer-run projections represent each par-
ticipant’s assessment of the value to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” 
is defined as the future path of policy that each partici-
pant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic 
activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual 
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of 
maximum employment and stable prices. 

FOMC participants generally expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) would be at or somewhat above their 
individual estimates of the longer-run growth rate in 
2016 and 2017 and would converge toward the longer-
run rate in 2018 (table 1 and figure 1).  All participants 
projected that by the end of the current year, the unem-
ployment rate would decline to, or fall below, their indi-
vidual estimates of the longer-run normal unemploy-
ment rate—that is, their projected unemployment gaps 
would be zero or negative—and that these zero or neg-
ative gaps would persist through 2018, even though 
many participants reduced their estimates of the longer-
run normal rate.  All participants projected that inflation, 
as measured by the four-quarter change in the price in-
dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
would pick up in 2016 and 2017 from the very low rate 
seen in 2015.  Participants generally projected inflation 
to be either at or just slightly below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective by the end of 2018. 

As shown in figure 2, participants expected that it would 
be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate gradually over the projection period as head-
winds to economic growth dissipate slowly over time 
and as inflation rises toward the Committee’s goal of 
2 percent.  Consistent with this outlook, nearly all par-

ticipants projected that the appropriate level of the fed-
eral funds rate would be below their individual estimates 
of its longer-run level through 2018. 

Almost all participants regarded the levels of uncertainty 
associated with their forecasts for economic growth and 
the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms 
of the previous 20 years and shared a similar view re-
garding the uncertainty surrounding their inflation pro-
jections.  Participants were about evenly divided as to 
whether they judged the risks to their forecasts for real 
GDP growth to be weighted to the downside or broadly 
balanced; no participant saw risks to real GDP growth 
as weighted to the upside.  Participants who thought that 
risks to their outlook for real GDP growth were skewed 
to the downside tended to cite developments in foreign 
economies, recent volatility in financial markets, or the 
limited capacity of policy to respond to adverse develop-
ments as contributing to that view.  Risk perceptions re-
garding the unemployment rate were more dispersed.  
Most participants regarded risks to their unemployment 
rate forecasts as broadly balanced, but four participants 
considered risks as skewed toward a higher unemploy-
ment rate, and two viewed risks as weighted toward a 
lower unemployment rate.  A majority of participants 
thought that the risks attending their projections for 
PCE price inflation were weighted to the downside; al-
most all of these participants also saw risks to core PCE 
inflation as tilted in the same direction.  Among the rea-
sons cited by participants for perceptions of downside 
risk to their inflation projections were ongoing develop-
ments in overseas economies and their possible implica-
tions for U.S. import prices, declines in energy prices 
since December, and low readings for some indicators 
of long-term inflation expectations.    

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
A substantial majority of participants expected that, con-
ditional on their individual assumptions about appropri-
ate monetary policy, real GDP in 2016 and 2017 would 
increase at a rate above their individual estimates of the 
longer-run normal growth rate before decelerating to a 
pace at or near their individual estimates of the longer-
run normal rate.  A number of participants indicated that 
they expected domestic factors—including improving 
labor market conditions, stronger household and busi-
ness balance sheets, lower consumer energy prices, and 
a still-accommodative stance of monetary policy—to 
contribute to strength in aggregate expenditures, while

foreign conditions were projected to be a source of 
weakness for some time. 

Compared with their forecasts prepared for the Sum-
mary of Economic Projections (SEP) in December, 
most participants marked down their projections of real 
GDP growth in 2016, and several did so for 2017.  Over-
all, the median value of participants’ projections for real 
GDP growth in 2016 was revised down a little to 2.2 per-
cent, and that for 2017 was revised down slightly to 
2.1 percent. 

The median forecast for the unemployment rate was a 
bit lower in 2017 and 2018 than in December and 
showed a modest downward tilt over the three years of 
the forecast.  Participants cited stronger-than-expected 
labor market data in recent months as a factor explaining 
these revisions.  Moreover, many participants also re-
duced their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of 
unemployment, resulting in a modest reduction in the 
median of the longer-run rate.  Thus, while a majority 
expected the unemployment rate gap to turn negative by 
the end of this year, fewer participants projected a nega-
tive gap at that time than was the case in December.  For 
2017, all participants projected a negative unemploy-
ment rate gap, and a substantial majority did so for 2018 
as well.  All told, however, the medians of the unemploy-
ment rate gaps for the three years of the projection were 
essentially unchanged from the December SEP. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of partici-
pants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in 
the longer run.  The distribution of the projections of 
GDP growth shifted toward lower values for 2016; dif-
ferences from December for 2017 and 2018 were less 
noteworthy, but there was a modest narrowing of the 
distribution for 2018.  The distributions of projections 
for the unemployment rate in 2017 and beyond shifted 
modestly toward lower values, relative to the December 
SEP, on the basis of strong labor market indicators in 
recent months.  

The Outlook for Inflation 
All participants projected PCE price inflation to pick up 
in 2016 and to rise further in 2017.  For 2018, nearly all 
expected PCE price inflation to be at or very close to the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  However, 
relative to the December SEP, almost all participants 
marked down their projections for PCE price inflation 
in 2016, observing that declines in energy prices since 
the end of last year and continued strength in the dollar 
were expected to impart additional downward pressure 
on inflation this year.  Many participants also lowered 

their projections for inflation in 2017, although the me-
dian value for that year was unchanged.  Inflation pro-
jections in 2018 were little changed from December.  Re-
garding core PCE price inflation, some participants 
marked down their projections for 2016, although al-
most all still expected core inflation to rise gradually over 
the projection period and to be at or very close to 2 per-
cent by the end of 2018.  Factors cited by participants as 
contributing to their expectation that inflation will rise 
over the medium term included recent readings for core 
inflation, an anticipation that improvements in labor 
markets will continue, the fading effects of recent dollar 
appreciation and declines in oil prices, and an assessment 
that long-term inflation expectations will remain at levels 
consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, all sup-
ported by a stance of monetary policy that participants 
generally described as accommodative.  

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The distribution for PCE price inflation in 2016 
shifted notably to the left compared with the December 
SEP, while changes in the distributions of projections 
for 2017 and 2018 were small.  The distributions of par-
ticipants’ projections for core PCE price inflation shifted 
only a touch toward lower values for 2017 and 2018 as 
compared with December. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2016 to 2018 and over the longer run.  Relative to De-
cember, the projections of the appropriate levels of the 
federal funds rate over the next three years shifted nota-
bly toward lower values.  The median projections for the 
federal funds rate at the end of 2016 and 2017 both de-
clined 0.50 percentage point, to levels of 0.88 percent 
and 1.88 percent, respectively, while the median for the 
end of 2018 fell 0.25 percentage point, to 3.0 percent.  
The median for the federal funds rate in the longer run 
was also reduced 0.25 percentage point, to 3.25 percent.  
The view that a lower path of the federal funds rate rel-
ative to December would be appropriate for achieving 
the Committee’s objectives was broadly shared across 
participants, especially for the first two years of their 
forecasts.  Given their expectations that certain factors 
would continue to restrain economic growth for a time, 
that inflation will increase only gradually to 2 percent, 
and that the economic and policy outlook entails asym-
metric risks over the next few years, participants gener-
ally projected that a gradual rise in the federal funds rate

over that period would be appropriate; almost all partic-
ipants judged it advisable for the federal funds rate to 
remain below their individual estimates of its longer-run 
normal level through the end of 2018. 

Although the median of participants’ projections of the 
federal funds rate in the longer run moved lower, the 
range of estimates for the longer-run rate was unchanged 
from December.  Hence, with all participants anticipat-
ing that inflation would eventually reach the Commit-
tee’s objective of 2 percent, the range of participants’ 
judgments of the longer-run level of the real federal 
funds rate was also unchanged from December, at 1 to 
2 percent; the median value for the longer-run real rate 
was 1.25 percent, down 0.25 percentage point from De-
cember. 

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary 
policy were informed by their judgments about the out-
look for economic activity, labor markets, and inflation 
as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with that 
outlook.  One important consideration for many partic-
ipants was their assessment that several factors—includ-
ing weak foreign economic conditions, a persistently 
high exchange value of the dollar, and tighter financial 
conditions—will continue to restrain economic growth 
for a time and thus collectively imply a temporarily low 
level for the neutral rate of interest.  These forces, com-
bined with the current proximity of short-term interest 
rates to their effective lower bound and the related asym-
metry of risks around the outlook for real GDP growth 
and inflation, were noted as reasons why a gradual ap-
proach to raising the federal funds rate would be appro-
priate, provided that the outlook for the economy un-
folded about as expected.  Another consideration under-
lying the anticipated gradual removal of policy accom-
modation involved the prospects for inflation to return 
to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent.  In assessing 
those prospects, participants weighed the implications of 
a range of factors, including indicators of longer-run in-
flation expectations and the magnitude and persistence 
of the effects of both low energy prices and the earlier 
appreciation of the dollar.  Judgments regarding the 
likely future strength of the labor market and future 
wage gains also figured into participants’ forecasts for 
inflation.

At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 

Uncertainty and Risks 
As in the December SEP, nearly all participants judged 
the levels of uncertainty around their projections for real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and both headline 
and core PCE price inflation as broadly similar to the 
average levels of the past 20 years (as shown in the left-
hand column of figure 4).1  In contrast, participants re-
vised appreciably their assessments of the risks to real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and both headline 
and core inflation since December (as shown in the 
right-hand column).   Eight participants saw the risks to 
real GDP growth as weighted to the downside—up 
from three in December.  Four participants saw risks to 
the unemployment rate as skewed toward higher unem-
ployment—two more than in December—while two 
continued to see risks weighted toward lower unemploy-
ment.  Explanations for the less marked shift in risks to 
the outlook for the unemployment rate versus the out-
look for real GDP growth included favorable labor mar-
ket news over the past three months.  More generally, 
participants cited financial market and global economic 
conditions, either on their own or coupled with the lim-
ited capacity of policymakers to respond to possible ad-
verse economic conditions, as reasons for the downward 
tilt to their perceptions of the risks to growth.  Turning 

discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

to inflation, 11 participants indicated that the risks to 
their headline inflation forecasts were skewed to the 
downside, up from 7 in December, and nearly all of 
these participants saw the same tilt to the risks for core 
inflation.  Many participants noted some recent evidence 

of a deterioration, or an absence of improvement, in in-
dicators of long-term inflation expectations as contrib-
uting to increased downside risks for inflation, while 
some pointed to the further declines in energy prices.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the 
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform 
discussions of monetary policy among policy-
makers and can aid public understanding of the 
basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-
tainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relation-
ships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the 
real world, and the future path of the economy 
can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-
ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely eco-
nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-
tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-
ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they oc-
cur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-
tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate 
the considerable uncertainty associated with 
economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that ex-
perienced in the past and the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported in table 2 would imply a probability of 
about 70 percent  that  actual  GDP  would  ex- 

pand within a range of 1.4 to 4.6 percent in the 
current year and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the second 
and third years.  The corresponding 70 percent 
confidence intervals for overall inflation would 
be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year and 0.9 
to 3.1 percent in the second and third years. 

Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, 
participants provide judgments as to whether 
the uncertainty attached to their projections of 
each variable is greater than, smaller than, or 
broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-
certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-
ipants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the up-
side, are weighted to the downside, or are 
broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge 
whether each variable is more likely to be above 
or below their projections of the most likely out-
come.  These judgments about the uncertainty 
and the risks attending each participant’s projec-
tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-
pants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks 
associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of differ-
ent projections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-
certainty arises primarily because each partici-
pant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  
If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected 
manner, then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change 
from that point forward.
