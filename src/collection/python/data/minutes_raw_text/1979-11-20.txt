By unanimous vote, System open market transactions 

in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers 

acceptances during the periods September 18 through October 5 

and October 6 through November 19, 1979, were ratified.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by 

the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account 

in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting sug
gests that real output of goods and services is 
declining in the current quarter, after the third
quarter rebound, and that prices on the average are 
continuing to rise rapidly. Retail sales, which had 
expanded sharply during the third quarter in both 
constant and current dollars, dropped in October.  
Industrial production remained near its midyear 
level. Nonfarm payroll employment rose consider
ably, after three months of little growth, but the 
unemployment rate increased from 5.8 to 6.0 percent.  
Producer prices of finished goods continued to rise 
rapidly in October, in part because of further sharp 
increases in energy items and the spreading effects 
of earlier increases in energy costs. The rise in 
the index of average hourly earnings during the first 
10 months of the year was close to the rapid pace 
during 1978.  

On October 6 the Federal Reserve announced a 
series of complementary actions directed toward 
assuring control over the expansion.of money and 
bank credit and toward curbing speculative excesses 
in commodity and financial markets, including foreign 
exchange markets. The actions included an increase 
in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates from 11 per
cent to 12 percent; establishment of a marginal 
reserve requirement on increases in the total of 
managed liabilities of member banks, Edge corpora
tions, and U. S. agencies and branches of foreign 
banks; and a shift in the conduct of open market 
operations to an approach placing greater emphasis 
in day-to-day operations on the supply of bank 
reserves and less emphasis on confining short-term 
fluctuations in the federal funds rate.

Following the announcement on October 6, the 
downward pressure on the dollar in the exchange 
markets that had developed in September was reversed, 
and by the end of October the trade-weighted value 
of the dollar against major foreign currencies had 
risen about 3-1/2 percent. In mid-November, however, 
the value of the dollar declined, reflecting in part 
developments concerning Iran. The U. S. foreign 
trade deficit increased in September as the cost of 
oil imports rose, but the deficit was somewhat lower 

for the third quarter as a whole than for the second 
quarter.  

Growth of M-1, which had accelerated in September 
and was exceptionally rapid in the third quarter as a 
whole, slowed sharply in October to an annual rate of 
2-1/2 percent. Expansion of interest-bearing deposits 
included in M-2 remained strong, as a rise in net 
flows into time deposits at commercial banks in res
ponse to increased yields offset a contraction in 
savings deposits. Inflows of deposits at nonbank 
thrift institutions slowed somewhat. Flows into 
money market mutual funds accelerated. Growth of 
commercial bank credit moderated in October; never
theless, banks increased their reliance on the negoti
able, large-denomination CD's and other managed 
liabilities that became subject to the marginal 
reserve requirement in the statement week beginning 
October 11. Both short- and long-term market 
interest rates have risen sharply on balance since 
the early October announcement of the System's 
policy actions, although most recently rates have 
declined; mortgage interest rates have increased 
substantially further.  

Taking account of past and prospective develop
ments in employment, unemployment, production, invest
ment, real income, productivity, international trade 
and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market 
Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial 
conditions that will resist inflationary pressures 
while encouraging moderate economic expansion and 
contributing to a sustainable pattern of international 
transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the 
Committee agreed that these objectives would be 
furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the 
fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 
within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 per
cent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges

that had been established in February. The range for 
M-1 had been established originally on the basis of 
an assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts 
would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over 
the year. It now appears that expansion of such 
accounts will dampen growth by about 1-1/2 percentage 
points over the year; thus after allowance for the 
deviation from the earlier estimate, the equivalent 
range for M-1 is now 3 to 6 percent. The associated 
range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  
The Committee anticipates that for the period from 
the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 
1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending 
upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate 
adjustments that may be required by legislation or 
judicical developments affecting interest-bearing 
transactions accounts. These ranges will be recon
sidered at any time as conditions warrant.  

In the short run, the Committee seeks to 
restrain expansion of reserve aggregates to a pace 
consistent with deceleration in growth of M-1, M-2, 
and M-3 in the fourth quarter of 1979 to rates that 
would hold growth of these monetary aggregates over 
the whole period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to 
the fourth quarter of 1979 within the Committee's 
longer-run ranges, provided that in the period 
before the next regular meeting the weekly average 
federal funds rate remains within a range of 11-1/2 
to 15-1/2 percent.  

If it appears during the period before the 
next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds 
rate is inconsistent with the objective for the 
expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic 
Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who 
will then decide whether the situation calls for 
supplementary instructions from the.Committee.  

By unanimous vote, responsibility for making deter

minations with respect to appeals of denial of access to 

Committee records, under the provisions of 271.4(d) of the

- 6 -

Committee's Rules Regarding Availability of Information, was 

delegated to Mr. Schultz, and in his absence, to Mr. Coldwell.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 

would be held on Wednesday, January 9, 1980, beginning at 

9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
