By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of 

the Federal Open Market Committee held on May 19, 1987, were approved.  

By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign 

currencies during the period May 19, 1987, through July 6, 1987, were 

ratified.  

By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government 

securities and federal agency obligations during the period May 19, 1987, 

through July 6, 1987, were ratified.  

1/ Attended portion of meeting related to consideration of the Committee's 
longer-run objectives for monetary and debt aggregates.



By unanimous vote, the following ranges for growth in the broader 

aggregates and nonfinancial debt in 1987 and the role of M1 were approved 

by the Committee: 

The Committee agreed at this meeting to reaffirm 
the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 
to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987.  

The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates 
around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate 
in light ofdevelopments with respect to velocity and 
signs of the potential for some strengthening in underlying 
inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity 
is expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range 

for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in 
February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 
percent.  

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, 
based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must 
be judged in the light of other evidence relating to 
economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have 
become much more sensitive in recent years to changes 
in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this 
sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing 
of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the 
year, the Committee again decided not to establish a 
specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder 
of 1987 and no tentative range has been set for 1988.  
The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will 
continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior 
of its velocity, developments in the economy and 
financial markets, and the nature of emerging price 
pressures. The Committee welcomes substantially 
slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context 
of continuing economic expansion and some evidence 
of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee in 
reaching operational decisions over the balance of 
the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light 
of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved 
with establishing a target for M1 will be carefully 
reappraised at the beginning of 1988.

With Ms. Seger dissenting, the following tentative ranges for 

growth in the broader aggregates and nonfinancial debt in 1988 were 

adopted by the Committee: 

For 1988, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of 
monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 

to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both 
M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at 
7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  

By unanimous vote (with Ms. Seger dissenting from the decision 

on the tentative ranges for 1988), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was 

authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 

execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 

domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
on balance that economic activity expanded at a moderate 
pace in the second quarter. In May and June, total non
farm payroll employment rose modestly further, with most 
of the gains continuing to be in the service-producing 
sectors. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.1 
percent in June and was down appreciably from its average 
level in the first quarter. Industrial production 
increased substantially in May after rising moderately 
on balance in earlier months of the year. Consumer 
spending appears to have increased in the second quarter, 
but housing starts were down somewhat further in May to 
a level considerably below their first-quarter average.  
Recent indicators of business capital spending point to 
some recovery, particularly in equipment outlays, from 
a depressed level in the first quarter. In April the 
merchandise trade deficit was smaller than in March and 
below the monthly average for the first quarter. The 
rise in consumer and producer prices moderated in May 
but for the year to date prices have risen more rapidly 
than in 1986, primarily reflecting sizable increases in 
prices of energy and non-oil imports. Wage increases 
have remained relatively moderate in recent months.  

M2 increased slightly in May and June while growth 
of M3 remained moderate. For 1987 through June, ex
pansion of M2 has been below the lower end of the range 
established by the Committee for the year, and growth 
of M3 around the lower end of its range. Following a

surge in April, M1 contracted on balance in May and June.  
Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has 
moderated this year.  

Most interest rates have declined somewhat on balance 
since the May 19 meeting of the Committee. In foreign 
exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar 

against the other G-10 currencies has risen on balance 
since the May meeting.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster reasonable 
price stability over time, promote growth in output on 
a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern 
of international transactions. In furtherance of these 
objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to re
affirm the ranges established in February for growth of 
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from 
the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987.  
The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates 
around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate 
in light of developments with respect to velocity and 
signs of the potential for some strengthening in underlying 
inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity 
is expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range 
for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in 
February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 
percent.  

For 1988, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of 
monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 
to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both 
M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at 
7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, 
based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must 
be judged in the light of other evidence relating to 
economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have 
become much more sensitive in recent years to changes 
in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this 
sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing 
of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the 
year, the Committee again decided not to establish a 
specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder 
of 1987 and no tentative range has been set for 1988.  
The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will 
continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior

of its velocity, developments in the economy and 
financial markets, and the nature of emerging price 
pressures. The Committee welcomes substantially 
slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context 
of continuing economic expansion and some evidence 

of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee in 
reaching operational decisions over the balance of 
the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light 
of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved 
with establishing a target for M1 will be.carefully 
reappraised at the beginning of 1988.  

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. Somewhat 
greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve 
restraint would be acceptable depending on indications 
of inflationary pressures and on developments in 
foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of 
the aggregates and the strength of the business ex
pansion. This approach is expected to be consistent 
with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June 
through September at annual rates of around 5 and 
7-1/2 percent, respectively. Growth in M1, while 
picking up from recent levels, is expected to remain 
well below its pace during 1986. The Chairman may 
call for Committee consultation if it appears to the 
Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions 
during the period before the next meeting are likely 
to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently 
outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on August 18, 1987.  

The meeting adjourned.
