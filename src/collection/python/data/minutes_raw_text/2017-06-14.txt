Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets over the period since the May 
FOMC meeting.  Yields on Treasury securities and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar had declined mod-
estly, while equity prices had continued to rise, contrib-
uting to a further easing of financial conditions accord-
ing to some measures.  Moreover, realized and implied 
volatility in financial markets remained low.  Meanwhile, 
inflation compensation edged lower.  Survey results and 
market pricing suggested that market participants saw a 
high probability of an increase in the FOMC’s target 
range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. 

The deputy manager reviewed survey results on market 
expectations for SOMA reinvestment policy and for the 
evolution of the System’s balance sheet over coming 
years.  The deputy manager also commented on money 
market developments.  Over the intermeeting period, 
the federal funds rate remained well within the FOMC’s 
target range, and take-up at the System’s overnight re-
verse repurchase agreement facility was little changed 
from the previous period.  The spread between the 
three-month London interbank offered rate and the 
overnight index swap (OIS) rate had narrowed markedly 
in recent months after rising noticeably in advance of the 
implementation of money market fund reform in the fall 
of 2016.  The deputy manager also summarized details 
of the operational approach that the Open Market Desk

planned to follow if the Committee adopted the pro-
posal for SOMA reinvestment policy to be considered at 
this meeting. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy 
The Chair observed that, starting with the March 2017 
FOMC meeting, Committee participants had been dis-
cussing approaches to reducing the Federal Reserve’s se-
curities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.  
She noted that participants appeared to have reached a 
consensus on an approach that involved specifying caps 
on the monthly amount of principal payments from se-
curities holdings that would not be reinvested; these caps 
would rise over the period of a year, after which they 
would remain constant.  Given this consensus, the Chair 
proposed that participants approve the plan and that it 
be published as an addendum to the Committee’s Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans; the addendum 
would be released at the conclusion of this meeting so as 
to inform the public well in advance of implementing the 
reinvestment policy.  It was anticipated that when the 
Committee determined that economic conditions war-
ranted implementation of the program, that step would 
be communicated through the Committee’s postmeeting 
statement.  Participants unanimously supported the pro-
posal. 

POLICY NORMALIZATION PRINCIPLES AND 
PLANS 
(Addendum adopted June 13, 2017) 

All participants agreed to augment the Committee’s Pol-
icy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing the 
following additional details regarding the approach the 
FOMC intends to use to reduce the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of Treasury and agency securities once normal-
ization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under 
way.1 
• The Committee intends to gradually reduce the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by decreasing its 
reinvestment of the principal payments it receives 
from securities held in the System Open Market Ac-
count.  Specifically, such payments will be reinvested 
only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising 
caps. 
○ For payments of principal that the Federal Re-
serve receives from maturing Treasury securities, 

the Committee anticipates that the cap will be $6 bil-
lion per month initially and will increase in steps of 
$6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months 
until it reaches $30 billion per month. 
○ For payments of principal that the Federal Re-
serve receives from its holdings of agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities, the Committee antici-
pates that the cap will be $4 billion per month ini-
tially and will increase in steps of $4 billion at three-
month intervals over 12 months until it reaches 
$20 billion per month. 
○ The Committee also anticipates that the caps 
will remain in place once they reach their respective 
maximums so that the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and 
predictable manner until the Committee judges that 
the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities 
than necessary to implement monetary policy effi-
ciently and effectively. 

• Gradually reducing the Federal Reserve’s securi-
ties holdings will result in a declining supply of reserve 
balances.  The Committee currently anticipates reduc-
ing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a 
level appreciably below that seen in recent years but 
larger than before the financial crisis; the level will re-
flect the banking system’s demand for reserve balances 
and the Committee’s decisions about how to imple-
ment monetary policy most efficiently and effectively 
in the future.  The Committee expects to learn more 
about the underlying demand for reserves during the 
process of balance sheet normalization. 
• The Committee affirms that changing the target 
range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of 
adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  However, the 
Committee would be prepared to resume reinvest-
ment of principal payments received on securities held 
by the Federal Reserve if a material deterioration in the 
economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction 
in the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate.  
Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use 
its full range of tools, including altering the size and 
composition of its balance sheet, if future economic 
conditions were to warrant a more accommodative 
monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reduc-
ing the federal funds rate.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the June 13–14 meeting 
showed that labor market conditions continued to 
strengthen in recent months and suggested that real 
gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a faster 
pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  The 
12-month change in overall consumer prices, as meas-
ured by the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), slowed a bit further in April; total 
consumer price inflation and core inflation, which ex-
cludes consumer food and energy prices, were both run-
ning somewhat below 2 percent.  Survey-based measures 
of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed 
on balance. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in 
April and May, and the average pace of job gains over 
the first five months of the year was solid.  The unem-
ployment rate moved down to 4.3 percent in May; the 
unemployment rates for African Americans and for His-
panics stepped down but remained above the unemploy-
ment rates for Asians and for whites.  The overall labor 
force participation rate declined somewhat, and the 
share of workers employed part time for economic rea-
sons decreased a little.  The rate of private-sector job 
openings increased in March and April, while the quits 
rate was little changed and the hiring rate moved down.  
The four-week moving average of initial claims for un-
employment insurance benefits remained at a very low 
level through early June.  Measures of labor compensa-
tion continued to rise at moderate rates.  Compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 
2¼ percent over the four quarters ending in the first 
quarter, a bit slower than over the same period a year 
earlier.  Average hourly earnings for all employees in-
creased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in May, 
about the same as over the comparable period a year ear-
lier.   

Total industrial production rose considerably in April, 
reflecting gains in manufacturing, mining, and utilities 
output.  Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that 
motor vehicle production would slow in subsequent 
months, but broader indicators of manufacturing pro-
duction, such as the new orders indexes from national 
and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to modest 
gains in factory output over the near term.  

Real PCE rose solidly in April after increasing only mod-
estly in the first quarter.  Light motor vehicle sales picked 
up in April but then moved down somewhat in May.  
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its esti-
mate of PCE were flat in May, but estimated increases in 
these components of sales for the previous two months 
were revised up.  In addition, recent readings on key fac-
tors that influence consumer spending pointed to fur-
ther solid growth in total real PCE in the near term, in-
cluding continued gains in employment, real disposable 
personal income, and households’ net worth.  Moreover, 
consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat in 
May. 

Residential investment appeared to be slowing after in-
creasing briskly in the first quarter.  The first-quarter 
strength may have reflected housing activity shifting ear-
lier in response to unseasonably warm weather last quar-
ter, to an anticipation of higher future interest rates, or 
to both.  Starts of new single-family homes edged up in 
April, but the issuance of building permits for these 
homes declined somewhat.  Meanwhile, starts of multi-
family units fell.  Moreover, sales of both new and exist-
ing homes decreased in April.  

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property seemed to be increasing further after 
rising at a solid pace in the first quarter.  Both nominal 
shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft rose in April, and new orders contin-
ued to exceed shipments, pointing to further gains in 
shipments in the near term.  In addition, indicators of 
business sentiment were upbeat in recent months.  Al-
though firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential 
structures excluding drilling and mining declined in 
April, the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an in-
dicator of spending for structures in the drilling and min-
ing sector, continued to rise through early June. 

Nominal federal government spending data for April 
and May pointed to essentially flat real federal purchases 
in the second quarter.  Real state and local government 
purchases appeared to be moving down, as state and lo-
cal government payrolls declined, on net, in April and 
May, and nominal construction expenditures by these 
governments decreased in April. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened 
slightly in March, with a small decline in exports and a 
small increase in imports.  The March data, together with 
revised estimates for earlier months, indicated that real 
exports grew briskly in the first quarter and at a faster

pace than in the second half of 2016.  Real imports also 
increased in the first quarter but at a slower pace than in 
the second half of 2016.  In April, the nominal trade def-
icit widened, as imports picked up while exports de-
clined slightly.  Net exports were estimated to have made 
a small positive contribution to real GDP growth in the 
first quarter.  However, the April trade data suggested 
that net exports might be a slight drag on real GDP 
growth in the second quarter.   

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1¾ percent over the 12 months 
ending in April.  Core PCE price inflation was 1½ per-
cent over those same 12 months.  Over the 12 months 
ending in May, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a 
little less than 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 
1¾ percent.  The median of inflation expectations over 
the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey was un-
changed in May, and the median expectation for PCE 
price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters also held steady in the second 
quarter.  Likewise, the medians of longer-run inflation 
expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers 
and Survey of Market Participants were essentially un-
changed in June. 

The economic expansions in Canada and the euro area 
as well as in China and many other emerging market 
economies (EMEs) continued to firm in the first quarter.  
In contrast, economic growth in the United Kingdom 
slowed sharply.  Recent indicators suggested that real 
GDP growth in most foreign economies remained solid 
in the second quarter.  Headline inflation across the ad-
vanced foreign economies (AFEs) generally appeared to 
moderate from the pace registered over the first quarter, 
as the effects of earlier increases in energy prices started 
to fade; core inflation continued to be subdued in many 
AFEs.  Among the EMEs, inflation in China rose while 
inflation in Latin America fell.  In Mexico, the effects of 
fuel price hikes in January and the pass-through from 
earlier currency depreciation to prices started to wane, 
but inflation remained above the central bank’s target.   

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial market conditions remained gener-
ally accommodative over the intermeeting period.  U.S. 
equity prices increased over the period, longer-term 
Treasury yields declined, and the dollar depreciated.  A 
decline in the perceived likelihood of a significant fiscal 
expansion and the below-expectations reading on the 
April CPI reportedly contributed to lower yields on 
longer-tenor Treasury securities.  Market participants’ 
perceptions of an improved global economic outlook 

appeared to provide some support to prices of risk as-
sets.  

FOMC communications over the intermeeting period 
were viewed as broadly in line with investors’ expecta-
tions that the Committee would continue to remove pol-
icy accommodation at a gradual pace.  Market partici-
pants interpreted the May FOMC statement and the 
meeting minutes as indicating that the Committee had 
not materially changed its economic outlook.  In re-
sponse to the discussion of SOMA reinvestment policy 
in the minutes, a number of market participants report-
edly pulled forward their expectations for the most likely 
timing of a change to the Committee’s reinvestment pol-
icy, a shift that was evident in the responses to the 
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market 
Participants.  However, investors also reportedly viewed 
the Committee’s planning as mitigating the risk that the 
process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal-
ance sheet would lead to outsized movements in interest 
rates or have adverse effects on market functioning. 

The probability of an increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate occurring at the June meeting, as im-
plied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, rose 
to a high level.  However, the expected federal funds rate 
from late 2018 to the end of 2020 implied by OIS quotes 
declined slightly.  Immediately following the May 
FOMC meeting, nominal Treasury yields rose at short 
and intermediate maturities, reportedly reflecting the re-
sponse of investors to a passage in the postmeeting 
statement indicating the Committee’s view that the slow-
ing in real GDP growth during the first quarter was likely 
to be transitory.  Later in the intermeeting period, yields 
declined in reaction to the release of weaker-than- 
expected April CPI data and the somewhat disappoint-
ing May employment report.  On balance, the Treasury 
yield curve flattened, with short-term yields rising mod-
estly and the 10-year yield declining.  Both 5-year and  
5-to-10-year-forward TIPS-based inflation compensa-
tion declined, in part reflecting the below-expectations 
inflation data.  

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased.  One-month-
ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—
the VIX—was little changed, on net, and remained near 
the lower end of its historical range.   

Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Yields on a broad set of 
money market instruments remained in the ranges ob-
served since the FOMC increased the target range for 
the federal funds rate in March.  Term OIS rates rose as

expectations firmed for an increase in the federal funds 
rate target at this meeting.   

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses contin-
ued to be accommodative.  Commercial and industrial 
loans outstanding increased in April and May after being 
weak in the first quarter, although the growth of these 
loans remained well below the pace seen a year ago.  Is-
suance of both corporate debt and equity was strong.  
Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans was solid 
in April and May, although it receded from the near-rec-
ord levels seen over the previous two months.  

Commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks’ books 
grew robustly in April and May, with nonfarm nonresi-
dential loans leading the expansion.  However, recent 
CRE loan growth was a bit slower than that during the 
first quarter, in part reflecting a slowdown in lending for 
both construction and multifamily units.  Issuance of 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
through the first five months of this year was similar to 
the issuance over the same period a year earlier.  While 
delinquency rates on CRE loans held by banks edged 
down further in the first quarter, the delinquency rates 
on loans in CMBS pools continued to increase.  The rise 
in CMBS delinquency rates was mostly confined to loans 
that were originated during the period of weak under-
writing before the financial crisis.  The increase in those 
delinquencies had generally been expected by market 
participants and was not anticipated to have a material 
effect on credit availability or market conditions. 

Residential mortgage rates declined slightly, in line with 
yields on longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed se-
curities, but remained elevated relative to the third quar-
ter of 2016.  Despite the higher level of mortgage rates, 
growth in mortgage lending for home purchases re-
mained near the upper end of its recent range during the 
first quarter.  Delinquency rates on residential mortgage 
loans continued to edge down amid robust house price 
growth and still-tight lending standards for households 
with low credit scores and hard-to-document incomes. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally accommodative, although some indi-
cators pointed to modest reductions in credit availability 
in recent months.  Tighter conditions for credit card bor-
rowing were especially apparent within the subprime 
segment, where there had been some further deteriora-
tion of credit performance.  On a year-over-year basis, 
overall credit card balances continued to grow in April 
at a robust rate, although the pace had moderated a bit 
from that of 2016.  

Growth in auto loans remained solid through the first 
quarter.  Overall delinquency rates on auto loans contin-
ued to be relatively low, but the delinquency rate among 
subprime borrowers remained elevated, reflecting easier 
lending standards in 2015 and 2016.  Recent evidence 
suggested that these lending standards had tightened; the 
credit rating of the average borrower had trended higher, 
and new extensions of subprime auto loans had de-
clined. 

Over the period since the May FOMC meeting, foreign 
financial markets were influenced by incoming eco-
nomic data and by political developments both abroad 
and in the United States.  Most AFE and EME equity 
indexes edged higher, supported by robust first-quarter 
earnings reports and generally positive data releases 
overseas.  The broad U.S. dollar depreciated about 
1¾ percent over the intermeeting period, weakening 
against both AFE and EME currencies.  In particular, 
the dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar fol-
lowing communications by the Bank of Canada suggest-
ing that the removal of policy accommodation could oc-
cur sooner than previously expected by market partici-
pants.  The dollar also depreciated against the euro, 
which was supported by the results of the French presi-
dential election and by stronger-than-expected macro-
economic releases.  Those data releases prompted the 
European Central Bank at its June 8 meeting to change 
its assessment of risks to the economic outlook from 
“tilted to the downside” to “balanced.”  U.S. develop-
ments, including mixed economic data reports, also 
weighed on the dollar.  In contrast, the dollar strength-
ened against sterling following the U.K. parliamentary 
election.  Changes in longer-dated AFE sovereign bond 
yields were mixed, while shorter-dated yields moved 
slightly higher.  EME sovereign spreads were little 
changed, while flows into EME mutual funds remained 
robust.  However, Brazilian sovereign spreads widened 
and the Brazilian real depreciated notably amid increased 
political uncertainty. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was fore-
cast to step up to a solid pace in the second quarter fol-
lowing its weak reading in the first quarter, primarily re-
flecting faster real PCE growth.  On balance, the incom-
ing data on aggregate spending were a little stronger than 
the staff had expected, and the forecast of real GDP 
growth for the current year was a bit higher than in the 
previous projection.  Beyond this year, the projection for 
real GDP growth was essentially unchanged.  The staff 
continued to project that real GDP would expand at a 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 
through 2019, supported in part by the staff’s main-
tained assumption that fiscal policy would become more 
expansionary in the coming years.  The unemployment 
rate was projected to decline gradually over the next cou-
ple of years and to continue running below the staff’s 
estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as 
measured by the change in the PCE price index, was re-
vised down slightly for 2017 because of the weaker-than-
expected incoming data for inflation.  However, the pro-
jection was little changed thereafter, as the recent weak-
ness in inflation was viewed as transitory.  Inflation was 
still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last 
year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food 
and non-energy imports.  The staff projected that infla-
tion would increase further in the next couple of years, 
and that it would be close to the Committee’s longer-run 
objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  Many 
financial market indicators of uncertainty were subdued, 
and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook 
appeared to have subsided further, on balance, since late 
last year; these developments were judged as counter-
weights to elevated measures of economic policy uncer-
tainty.  The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real 
GDP and the unemployment rate as balanced; the staff’s 
assessment was that the downside risks associated with 
monetary policy not being well positioned to respond to 
adverse shocks had diminished since its previous fore-
cast.  The risks to the projection for inflation also were 
seen as roughly balanced.  The downside risks from the 
possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may 
have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate sub-
stantially were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the 
upside risk that inflation could increase more than ex-
pected in an economy that was projected to continue op-
erating above its longer-run potential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-

                                                 
4 Four members of the Board of Governors, one fewer than 
in March 2017, were in office at the time of the June 2017 
meeting and submitted economic projections.  The office of 
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was 

idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.4  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.5  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these 
minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that the infor-
mation received over the intermeeting period indicated 
that the labor market had continued to strengthen and 
that economic activity had been rising moderately, on 
average, so far this year.  Job gains had moderated since 
the beginning of the year but had remained solid, on av-
erage, and the unemployment rate had declined.  House-
hold spending had picked up in recent months, and busi-
ness fixed investment had continued to expand.  Infla-
tion measured on a 12-month basis had declined recently 
and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, 
had been running somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation remained 
low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation ex-
pectations were little changed on balance. 

Participants generally saw the incoming information on 
spending and labor market indicators as consistent, 
overall, with their expectations and indicated that their 
views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor 
market had changed only slightly since the May FOMC 
meeting.  As anticipated, growth in consumer spending 
seemed to have bounced back from a weak first quarter, 
and participants continued to expect that, with further 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, 
economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and 
labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat 
further.  In light of surprisingly low recent readings on 
inflation, participants expected that inflation on a  
12-month basis would remain somewhat below 2 per-
cent in the near term.  However, participants judged that 

vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; First Vice President 
Mark L. Mullinix submitted economic projections.   
5 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate.

inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term. 

Growth in consumer spending appeared to be rebound-
ing after slowing in the first quarter of this year.  Partic-
ipants generally continued to expect that ongoing job 
gains, rising household income and wealth, and im-
proved household balance sheets would support moder-
ate growth in household spending over the medium 
term.  However, District contacts reported that automo-
bile sales had slowed recently; some contacts expected 
sales to slow further, while others believed that sales 
were leveling out.   

Participants generally agreed that business fixed invest-
ment had continued to expand in recent months, sup-
ported in particular by a rebound in the energy sector.  
District contacts suggested that an expansion in oil pro-
duction capacity was likely to continue in the near term, 
though the longer-term outlook was more uncertain.  
Conditions in the manufacturing sector in several Dis-
tricts were reportedly strong, but activity in a couple of 
them had slowed in recent months from a high level, and 
some contacts in the automobile industry reported de-
clines in production that they expected to continue in 
the near term.  District reports regarding the service sec-
tor were generally positive.  In contrast, contacts in a 
couple of Districts indicated that conditions in the agri-
cultural sector remained weak.  Contacts in many Dis-
tricts remained optimistic about business prospects, 
which were supported in part by improving global con-
ditions.  However, this optimism appeared to have re-
cently abated somewhat, partly because contacts viewed 
the likelihood of significant fiscal stimulus as having di-
minished.  Contacts at some large firms indicated that 
they had curtailed their capital spending, in part because 
of uncertainty about changes in fiscal and other govern-
ment policies; some contacts at smaller firms, however, 
indicated that their capital spending plans had not been 
appreciably affected by news about government policy.  
Reports regarding housing construction from District 
contacts were mixed. 

Labor market conditions continued to strengthen in re-
cent months.  The unemployment rate fell from 4.5 per-
cent in March to 4.3 percent in May and was below levels 
that participants judged likely to be normal over the 
longer run.  Monthly increases in nonfarm payrolls aver-
aged 160,000 since the beginning of the year, down from 
187,000 per month in 2016 but still well above estimates 
of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants in the labor 
force.  A few participants interpreted this slowing in pay-
roll growth as an expected development that reflected a 

tight labor market.  Other labor market indicators, such 
as the number of job openings and broader measures of 
unemployment, were also seen as consistent with labor 
market conditions having strengthened in recent 
months.  Moreover, contacts in several Districts re-
ported shortages of workers in selected occupations and 
in some cases indicated that firms were significantly in-
creasing salaries and benefits in order to attract or keep 
workers.  However, other contacts reported only modest 
wage gains, and participants observed that measures of 
labor compensation for the overall economy continued 
to rise only moderately despite strengthening labor mar-
ket conditions.  A couple of participants saw the re-
strained increases in labor compensation as consistent 
with the low productivity growth and moderate inflation 
experienced in recent years.  In light of the recent behav-
ior of labor compensation and consumer prices as well 
as demographic trends, a number of participants low-
ered their estimate of the longer-run normal level of the 
unemployment rate. 

Recent readings on headline and core PCE price infla-
tion had come in lower than participants had expected.  
On a 12-month basis, headline PCE price inflation was 
running somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective in April, partly because of factors that appeared 
to be transitory.  Core PCE price inflation—which his-
torically has been a more useful predictor of future in-
flation, although it, too, can be affected by transitory fac-
tors—moved down from 1.8 percent in March to 
1.5 percent in April.  In addition, CPI inflation in May 
came in lower than expected.  Most participants viewed 
the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting 
idiosyncratic factors, including sharp declines in prices 
of wireless telephone services and prescription drugs, 
and expected these developments to have little bearing 
on inflation over the medium run.  Participants contin-
ued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors 
waned and labor market conditions strengthened fur-
ther, inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  Several par-
ticipants suggested that recent increases in import prices 
were consistent with this expectation.  However, several 
participants expressed concern that progress toward the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective 
might have slowed and that the recent softness in infla-
tion might persist.  Such persistence might occur in part 
because upward pressure on inflation from resource uti-
lization may be limited, as the relationship between these 
two variables appeared to be weaker than in previous 
decades.  However, a couple of other participants raised 
the concern that a tighter relationship between inflation

and resource utilization could reemerge if the unemploy-
ment rate ran significantly below its longer-run normal 
level, which could result in inflation running persistently 
above the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 

Overall, participants continued to see the near-term risks 
to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.  Partici-
pants again noted the uncertainty regarding the possible 
enactment, timing, and nature of changes to fiscal and 
other government policies and saw both upside and 
downside risks to the economic outlook associated with 
such changes.  A number of participants, pointing to im-
proved prospects for foreign economic growth, viewed 
the downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook stem-
ming from international developments as having re-
ceded further over the intermeeting period.  With regard 
to the outlook for inflation, some participants empha-
sized downside risks, particularly in light of the recent 
low readings on inflation along with measures of infla-
tion compensation and some survey measures of infla-
tion expectations that were still low.  However, a couple 
of participants expressed concern that a substantial un-
dershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-
ment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation 
or give rise to macroeconomic or financial imbalances 
that eventually could lead to a significant economic 
downturn.  Participants agreed that the Committee 
should continue to monitor inflation developments 
closely. 

In their discussion of recent developments in financial 
markets, participants observed that, over the intermeet-
ing period, equity prices rose, longer-term interest rates 
declined, and volatility in financial markets was generally 
low.  They also noted that, according to some measures, 
financial conditions had eased even as the Committee 
reduced policy accommodation and market participants 
continued to expect further steps to tighten monetary 
policy.  Participants discussed possible reasons why fi-
nancial conditions had not tightened.  Corporate earn-
ings growth had been robust; nevertheless, in the assess-
ment of a few participants, equity prices were high when 
judged against standard valuation measures.  Longer-
term Treasury yields had declined since earlier in the year 
and remained low.  Participants offered various explana-
tions for low bond yields, including the prospect of slug-
gish longer-term economic growth as well as the ele-
vated level of the Federal Reserve’s longer-term asset 
holdings.  Some participants suggested that increased 
risk tolerance among investors might be contributing to 
elevated asset prices more broadly; a few participants ex-
pressed concern that subdued market volatility, coupled 

with a low equity premium, could lead to a buildup of 
risks to financial stability. 

In their discussion of monetary policy, participants gen-
erally saw the outlook for economic activity and the  
medium-term outlook for inflation as little changed and 
viewed a continued gradual removal of monetary policy 
accommodation as being appropriate.  Based on this as-
sessment, almost all participants expressed the view that 
it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at 
this meeting.  These participants agreed that, even after 
an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate 
at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy would re-
main accommodative, supporting additional strengthen-
ing in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 
2 percent inflation.  A few participants also judged that 
the case for a policy rate increase at this meeting was 
strengthened by the easing, by some measures, in overall 
financial conditions over the previous six months.  One 
participant did not believe it was appropriate to raise the 
federal funds rate target range at this meeting; this par-
ticipant suggested that the Committee should maintain 
the target range for the federal funds rate at ¾ to 1 per-
cent until the inflation rate was actually moving toward 
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  

Participants noted that, with the process of normaliza-
tion of the level of the federal funds rate continuing, it 
would likely become appropriate this year for the Com-
mittee to announce and implement a specific timetable 
for its program of reducing reinvestment of the Federal 
Reserve’s securities holdings.  It was observed that the 
ensuing reduction in securities holdings would be grad-
ual and would follow an extended period of Committee 
communications on balance sheet normalization policy, 
including the information that would be released at the 
conclusion of this meeting.  Consequently, the effect on 
financial market conditions of the eventual announce-
ment of the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet normalization was expected to be limited. 

Participants expressed a range of views about the appro-
priate timing of a change in reinvestment policy.  Several 
preferred to announce a start to the process within a 
couple of months; in support of this approach, it was 
noted that the Committee’s communications had helped 
prepare the public for such a step.  However, some oth-
ers emphasized that deferring the decision until later in 
the year would permit additional time to assess the out-
look for economic activity and inflation.  A few of these 
participants also suggested that a near-term change to

reinvestment policy could be misinterpreted as signify-
ing that the Committee had shifted toward a less gradual 
approach to overall policy normalization. 

Several participants indicated that the reduction in policy 
accommodation arising from the commencement of bal-
ance sheet normalization was one basis for believing 
that, if economic conditions evolved broadly as antici-
pated, the target range for the federal funds rate would 
follow a less steep path than it otherwise would.  How-
ever, some other participants suggested that they did not 
see the balance sheet normalization program as a factor 
likely to figure heavily in decisions about the target range 
for the federal funds rate.  A few of these participants 
judged that the degree of additional policy firming that 
would result from the balance sheet normalization pro-
gram was modest. 

Participants generally reiterated their support for contin-
uing a gradual approach to raising the federal funds rate.  
Several participants expressed confidence that a series of 
further increases in the federal funds rate in coming 
years, along the lines implied by the medians of the pro-
jections for the federal funds rate in the June SEP, would 
contribute to a stabilization, over the medium term, of 
the inflation rate around the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective, especially as this tightening of monetary policy 
would affect the economy only with a lag and would start 
from a point at which policy was still accommodative.  
However, a few participants who supported an increase 
in the target range at the present meeting indicated that 
they were less comfortable with the degree of additional 
policy tightening through the end of 2018 implied by the 
June SEP median federal funds rate projections.  These 
participants expressed concern that such a path of in-
creases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove in-
consistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 per-
cent. 

Several participants endorsed a policy approach, such as 
that embedded in many participants’ projections, in 
which the unemployment rate would undershoot their 
current estimates of the longer-term normal rate for a 
sustained period.  They noted that the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment is difficult to measure and that 
recent evidence suggested resource pressures generated 
only modest responses of nominal wage growth and in-
flation.  Against this backdrop, possible benefits cited by 
policymakers of a period of tight labor markets included 
a further rise in nominal wage growth that would bolster 
inflation expectations and help push the inflation rate 
closer to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, as 

well as a stimulus to labor market participation and busi-
ness fixed investment.  It was also suggested that the 
symmetry of the Committee’s inflation goal might be un-
derscored if inflation modestly exceeded 2 percent for a 
time, as such an outcome would follow a long period in 
which inflation had undershot the 2 percent longer-term 
objective.  Several participants expressed concern that a 
substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting 
might make the economy more likely to experience fi-
nancial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation 
that would require a rapid policy tightening that, in turn, 
could raise the risk of an economic downturn.  However, 
other participants noted that if a sharp rise in inflation 
or inflation expectations did occur, the Committee could 
readily respond using conventional monetary policy 
tools.  With regard to financial stability, one participant 
emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant about 
financial developments but observed that previous epi-
sodes of elevated financial imbalances and low unem-
ployment had limited relevance for the present situation, 
as the current system of financial regulation was likely 
more robust than that prevailing before the financial cri-
sis. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indi-
cated that the labor market had continued to strengthen 
and that economic activity had been rising moderately so 
far this year.  Job gains had moderated but had been 
solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and 
the unemployment rate had declined.  Household spend-
ing had picked up in recent months, and business fixed 
investment had continued to expand. 

Inflation on a 12-month basis had declined recently and 
was running somewhat below 2 percent.  The measure 
of inflation excluding food and energy prices was like-
wise running somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low;  
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions had changed little on balance. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen 
somewhat further.  Inflation on a 12-month basis was 
expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the 
near term, but almost all members expected it to stabilize 
around 2 percent over the medium term, although they

were monitoring inflation developments closely.  Mem-
bers continued to judge that there was significant uncer-
tainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and 
other government policies but that near-term risks to the 
economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, especially 
as risks related to foreign economic and financial devel-
opments had diminished.  

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but 
one member agreed to raise the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent.  They noted that the 
stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor 
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent 
inflation. 

Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This as-
sessment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  Members also agreed that they would carefully 
monitor actual and expected developments in inflation 
in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.  
They expected that economic conditions would evolve 
in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate, and they agreed that the federal funds 
rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that 
are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the 
actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on 
the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee 
expected to begin implementing a balance sheet normal-
ization program in 2017, provided that the economy 
evolves broadly as anticipated.  This program, which 
would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal pay-
ments from those securities, was described in an adden-
dum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Princi-
ples and Plans to be released after this meeting. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 

of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective June 15, 2017, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 1 to 1¼ percent, including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 1.00 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per- 
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in May indicates that 
the labor market has continued to strengthen 
and that economic activity has been rising mod-
erately so far this year.  Job gains have moder-
ated but have been solid, on average, since the 
beginning of the year, and the unemployment 
rate has declined.  Household spending has 
picked up in recent months, and business fixed 
investment has continued to expand.  On a  
12-month basis, inflation has declined recently 
and, like the measure excluding food and energy 
prices, is running somewhat below 2 percent.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion remain low; survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment

and price stability.  The Committee continues to 
expect that, with gradual adjustments in the 
stance of monetary policy, economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace, and labor mar-
ket conditions will strengthen somewhat fur-
ther.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected 
to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near 
term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  
Near-term risks to the economic outlook ap-
pear roughly balanced, but the Committee is 
monitoring inflation developments closely. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a sustained re-
turn to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

                                                 
6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted 
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  This vote also en-
compassed approval by the Board of Governors of the estab-
lishment of a 1¾ percent primary credit rate by the remaining 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  The Committee currently 
expects to begin implementing a balance sheet 
normalization program this year, provided that 
the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.  
This program, which would gradually reduce 
the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by de-
creasing reinvestment of principal payments 
from those securities, is described in the accom-
panying addendum to the Committee’s Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, and Jerome 
H. Powell. 

Voting against this action:  Neel Kashkari. 

Mr. Kashkari dissented because he preferred to maintain 
the existing target range for the federal funds rate at this 
meeting.  In his view, recent data, while suggesting that 
the labor market had improved further, had increased 
doubts about achievement of the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run inflation objective and thus had not provided 
a compelling basis on which to firm monetary policy at 
this meeting.  He preferred to await additional evidence 
that the recent decline in inflation was temporary and 
that inflation was moving toward the Committee’s sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  He was concerned 
that raising the federal funds rate target range too soon 
increased the likelihood that inflation expectations 
would decline and that inflation would continue to run 
below 2 percent. 

To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to 
1¼ percent, effective June 15, 2017.  The Board of Gov-
ernors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percent-
age point increase in the primary credit rate (discount 
rate) to 1¾ percent, effective June 15, 2017.6 

Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of June 15, 2017, 
and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of 
the Board of such a request.  (Secretary’s note:  Subsequently, 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, St. Louis, and Min-
neapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the

would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 25–26, 
2017.  The meeting adjourned at 10:35 a.m. on June 14, 
2017.

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 13–14, 2017, meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2019 
and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection 
was based on information available at the time of the 
meeting, together with his or her assessment of appro-
priate monetary policy, including a path for the federal 
funds rate and its longer-run value, and assumptions 
about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.2  
The longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the value to which each variable would be 
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to 
the economy.3  “Appropriate monetary policy” is de-
fined as the future path of policy that each participant 
deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic ac-
tivity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual 
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of 
maximum employment and stable prices. 

All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year 
would run somewhat above their individual estimates of 
its longer-run rate.  Over half of these participants ex-
pected that economic growth would slow a bit in 2018, 
and almost all of them expected that in 2019 economic 
growth would run at or near its longer-run level.  All par-
ticipants who submitted longer-run projections expected 
that the unemployment rate would run below their esti-
mates of its longer-run normal level in 2017 and remain 
below that level through 2019.  The majority of partici-
pants also lowered their estimates of the longer-run nor-
mal rate of unemployment by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage 
point.  All participants projected that inflation, as meas-
ured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
would run below 2 percent in 2017 and then step up in 
the next two years; over half of them projected that in-
flation would be at the Committee’s 2 percent objective 

                                                 
1 Four members of the Board of Governors, one fewer than 
in March 2017, were in office at the time of the June 2017 
meeting and submitted economic projections.  The office of 
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was 
vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; First Vice President 
Mark L. Mullinix submitted economic projections.   

in 2019, and all judged that inflation would be within a 
couple of tenths of a percentage point of the objective 
in that year.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary sta-
tistics for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, participants generally expected 
that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant 
further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to 
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  Although some participants raised or 
lowered their federal funds rate projections since March, 
the median projections for the federal funds rate in 2017 
and 2018 were essentially unchanged, and the median 
projection in 2019 was slightly lower; the median projec-
tion for the longer-run federal funds rate was un-
changed.  However, the economic outlook is uncertain, 
and participants noted that their economic projections 
and assessments of appropriate monetary policy could 
change in response to incoming information. 

In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached 
to their projections as broadly similar to the average of 
the past 20 years, although a couple of participants saw 
the uncertainty associated with their real GDP growth 
forecasts as higher than average.  Most participants 
judged the risks around their projections for economic 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly 
balanced. 

Figures 4.A through 4.C for real GDP growth, the un-
employment rate, and inflation, respectively, present 
“fan charts” as well as charts of participants’ current as-
sessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding the 
economic projections.  The fan charts (the panels at the 
top of these three figures) show the median projections 
surrounded by confidence intervals that are computed 
from the forecast errors of various private and govern-
ment projections made over the past 20 years.  The 
width of the confidence interval for each variable at a 
given point is a measure of forecast uncertainty at that 
horizon.  For all three macroeconomic variables, these 
charts illustrate that forecast uncertainty is substantial 
and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.  

2 All participants submitted their projections in advance of the 
FOMC meeting; no projections were revised following the re-
lease of economic data on the morning of June 14. 
3 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate.

Reflecting, in part, the uncertainty about the future evo-
lution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and in-
flation, participants’ assessments of appropriate mone-
tary policy are also subject to considerable uncertainty.  
To illustrate the uncertainty regarding the appropriate 
path for monetary policy, figure 5 shows a comparable 
fan chart around the median projections for the federal 
funds rate.4  As with the macroeconomic variables, fore-
cast uncertainty for the federal funds rate is substantial 
and increases at longer horizons. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-
sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 
2.2 percent in 2017, 2.1 percent in 2018, and 1.9 percent 
in 2019; the median of projections for the longer-run 
normal rate of real GDP growth was 1.8 percent.  Com-
pared with the March Summary of Economic Projec-
tions (SEP), the medians of the forecasts for real GDP 
growth over the period from 2017 to 2019, as well as the 
median assessment of the longer-run growth rate, were 
mostly unchanged.  Fewer than half of the participants 
incorporated expectations of fiscal stimulus into their 
projections, and a couple indicated that they had marked 
down the magnitude of expected fiscal stimulus relative 
to March. 

All participants revised down their projections for the 
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 and of 
2018, and almost all also revised down their projections 
for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Many who did so cited recent lower-than-expected read-
ings on unemployment.  The median of the projections 
for the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in 2017 and 
4.2 percent in each of 2018 and 2019, 0.2 percentage 
point and 0.3 percentage point lower than in the March 
projections, respectively.  The majority of participants 
also revised down their estimates of the longer-run nor-
mal rate of unemployment by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage 
point, and the median longer-run level was 4.6 percent, 
down 0.1 percentage point from March.   

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2017 to 2019 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP 
growth for this year shifted up, with some participants 
now expecting real GDP growth between 2.4 and 
                                                 
4 The fan chart for the federal funds rate depicts the uncer-
tainty about the future path of appropriate monetary policy 
and is closely connected with the uncertainty about the future 
value of economic variables.  In contrast, the dot plot shown 

2.5 percent and none seeing it below 2 percent.  The dis-
tributions of projected real GDP growth in 2018, 2019, 
and in the longer run were broadly similar to the distri-
butions of the March projections.  The distributions of 
individual projections for the unemployment rate shifted 
down noticeably for 2017 and 2018.  Most participants 
projected an unemployment rate of 4.2 or 4.3 percent at 
the end of this year, and the majority anticipated an un-
employment rate between 4.0 and 4.3 percent at the end 
of 2018.  Participants’ projections also shifted down in 
2019 but were more dispersed than the distributions of 
their projected unemployment rates in the two earlier 
years.  The distribution of projections for the longer-run 
normal unemployment rate shifted down modestly. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
The median of projections for headline PCE price infla-
tion this year was 1.6 percent, down 0.3 percentage point 
from March.  As in March, median projected inflation 
was 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019.  About half of the 
participants anticipated that inflation would continue to 
run a bit below 2 percent in 2018, while only one partic-
ipant expected inflation above 2 percent in that year—
and, in that case, just modestly so.  More than half pro-
jected that inflation would be equal to the Committee’s 
objective in 2019.  A few participants projected that in-
flation would run slightly below 2 percent in that year, 
while several projected that it would run a little above 
2 percent.  The median of projections for core PCE 
price inflation was 1.7 percent in 2017, a decline of 
0.2 percentage point from March; the median projection 
for 2018 and 2019 was 2.0 percent, as in the March pro-
jections. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of projections for headline 
PCE price inflation and for core PCE price inflation in 
2017 shifted down noticeably from March, while the dis-
tributions for both measures of inflation in 2018 shifted 
down slightly.  Many participants cited recent surpris-
ingly low readings on inflation as a factor contributing 
to the revisions in their inflation forecasts. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint 
of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end 

in figure 2 displays the dispersion of views across individual 
participants about the appropriate level of the federal funds 
rate.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root

leased in the summer by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His-
torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance 
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Historical projections are the average level, in percent, in the fourth 
quarter of the year indicated. 

 

of each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run.5  
The distribution for 2017 was less dispersed than that in 
March, while the distribution for 2018 was slightly less 
dispersed.  The distributions in 2019 and in the longer 
run were broadly similar to those in March.  The median 
projections of the federal funds rate continued to show 
gradual increases, with the median assessment for 2017 
standing at 1.38 percent, consistent with three 25 basis 
point increases this year.  Thereafter, the medians of the 
projections were 2.13 percent at the end of 2018 and 
2.94 percent at the end of 2019; the median of the 
longer-run projections of the federal funds rate was 
3.00 percent. 

In discussing their June projections, many participants 
continued to express the view that the appropriate up-
ward trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next 
few years would likely be gradual.  That anticipated pace 
reflected a few factors, such as a neutral real interest rate 
that was currently low and was expected to move up only 
                                                 
5 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were in-
formed by the view that there are multiple possible medium-
term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are per-
sistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way 
 

slowly as well as a gradual return of inflation to the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent objective.  Several participants judged 
that a slightly more accommodative path of monetary 
policy than in their previous projections would likely be 
appropriate, citing an apparently slower rate of progress 
toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  In 
their discussions of appropriate monetary policy, half of 
the participants commented on the Committee’s rein-
vestment policy; all of those who did so expected a 
change in reinvestment policy before the end of this 
year. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
Projections of economic variables are subject to consid-
erable uncertainty.  In assessing the path of monetary 
policy that, in their view, is likely to be most appropriate, 
FOMC participants take account of the range of possible 
outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the po-
tential benefits and costs to the economy should they 
occur.  Table 2 provides one measure of forecast uncer-
tainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment 
rate, and total consumer price inflation—the root mean 
squared error (RMSE) for forecasts made over the past 
20 years.  This measure of forecast uncertainty is incor-
porated graphically in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, 
and 4.C, which display fan charts plotting the median 
SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by 
symmetric confidence intervals derived from the 
RMSEs presented in table 2.  If the degree of uncertainty 
attending these projections is similar to the typical mag-
nitude of past forecast errors and if the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, future outcomes of 
these variables would have about a 70 percent probabil-
ity of occurring within these confidence intervals.  For 
all three variables, this measure of forecast uncertainty is 
substantial and generally increases as the forecast hori-
zon lengthens.   

FOMC participants may judge that the width of the his-
torical fan charts shown in figures 4.A through 4.C does 
not adequately capture their current assessments of the 
degree of uncertainty that surrounds their economic 
projections.  Participants’ assessments of the current 
level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projec-
tions are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 
4.B, and 4.C.  All or nearly all participants viewed the 

that cannot be forecast.  Under this view, the economy cur-
rently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic 
activity with low productivity growth and a low short-term real 
interest rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other 
than inflation cannot be usefully projected.

based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more
information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,
on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the
historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around
their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who
judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view
the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of
the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly
balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the fourth quarter of the previous
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed
to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the
previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from
those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated
on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty
and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past
20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For
definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

uncertainty attached to their economic projections as 
broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, with 
three fewer participants than in March seeing uncertainty 
about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as higher than its historical average.6  In their dis-
cussion of the uncertainty attached to their current pro-
jections, most participants again expressed the view that, 
at this point, uncertainty surrounding prospective 
changes in fiscal and other government policies is very 
large or that there is not yet enough information to make 
reasonable assumptions about the timing, nature, and 
magnitude of the changes. 

The fan charts—which are constructed so as to be sym-
metric around the median projections—also may not 
fully reflect participants’ current assessments of the bal-
ance of risks to their economic projections.  Participants’ 
assessments of the balance of risks to their economic 
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in March, most participants 
judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core in-
flation as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly 
consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  Three partici-
pants judged the risks to the unemployment rate as 
weighted to the downside, and one participant judged 
the risks as weighted to the upside (as shown in the 
lower-right panel of figure 4.B).  In addition, the balance 
of risks to participants’ inflation projections shifted 

down slightly from March (shown in the lower-right 
panels of figure 4.C), as two fewer participants judged 
the risks to inflation to be weighted to the upside and 
two more viewed the risks as weighted to the downside.  

Participants’ assessments of the future path of the fed-
eral funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also 
subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting in part un-
certainty about the evolution of GDP growth, the un-
employment rate, and inflation over time.  The final line 
in table 2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of short-term 
interest rates.  These RMSEs are not strictly consistent 
with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, in 
part because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the 
likeliest outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s in-
dividual assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  
However, the associated confidence intervals provide a 
sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of 
the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about 
the macroeconomic variables and additional adjust-
ments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to off-
set the effects of shocks to the economy. 

Figure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the median SEP pro-
jections for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate 
surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the re-
sults presented in table 2.  As with the macroeconomic 
variables, forecast uncertainty is substantial and in-
creases at longer horizons.7  

  

                                                 
6 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions. 
7 If at some point in the future the confidence interval around 
the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be 
truncated at zero for purposes of the chart shown in figure 5; 

zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal 
funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past.  
This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan 
chart would be merely a convention and would not have any 
implication for possible future policy decisions regarding the 
use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary 
policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the 
third year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence inter-
vals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the 
current year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third 
years.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence 
bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on 
the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  However, in 
some instances, the risks around the projections may not be 
symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be 
negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projec-
tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in 
which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet-
rically positioned around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
