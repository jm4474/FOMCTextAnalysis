11/19-20/73

With Mr. Morris dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed 

by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account 

in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that 
growth in economic activity in the fourth quarter is likely 
to remain at about the moderate rate of the third quarter, 
but curtailment of oil supplies from abroad has generated 
considerable uncertainty about subsequent prospects. In 
October total nonfarm employment expanded substantially 
further, and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 to 4.5 
per cent. The advance in wage rates has remained relatively 
rapid, and unit labor costs have been increasing at a fast 
pace. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose sharply 
in October, reflecting in part large increases for petroleum 
products; although farm and food prices declined considerably 
further, they remained well above the pre-freeze level of early 
June. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated 
against major foreign currencies following announcement in 
late October of a large surplus in the U.S. merchandise 
trade balance, and the dollar strengthened markedly further in 
early November as expectations grew that the developing oil 

crisis would create particularly severe problems for Western 
Europe and Japan. In the third quarter and in October, the 
balance of payments on an official settlements basis was in 
substantial surplus.  

The narrowly defined money stock, which had declined 
in August and September, rose moderately in October. The 
more broadly defined money stock expanded sharply as a 
result of large net inflows at banks of consumer-type time 
deposits. Net deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions 
improved somewhat further. Bank credit expansion remained 
moderate in October, reflecting in part a lack of growth in 
business loans as borrowers shifted to the commercial paper 
market. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's, 
which had begun to decline in late September, fell substan
tially further. Short-term market interest rates, while 
fluctuating widely, rose on balance from mid-October to mid
November. Rates on most types of long-term market securities 
also advanced somewhat.

In light of the foregoing developments, it is 
the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to 
foster financial conditions conducive to abatement 
of inflationary pressures, a sustainable rate of 
advance in economic activity, and equilibrium in the 
country's balance of payments.  

To implement this policy, while taking account 
of international and domestic financial market develop
ments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and 
money market conditions consistent with moderate growth 
in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open 

Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 18, 1973, 

at 9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
