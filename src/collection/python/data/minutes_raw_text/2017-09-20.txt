The Committee unanimously voted to further amend its 
Rules Regarding Availability of Information (Rules) in 
order to incorporate input received during the public 
commenting process that followed the December 2016 

                                                 
3 Attended Tuesday session only. 

publication in the Federal Register of an earlier version of 
the Rules.4  The amendment approved at this meeting 
indicated that if, in the course of processing a Freedom 
of Information Act request, “an adverse determination 
is upheld on appeal, in whole or in part,” the requester 
will be informed “of the availability of dispute resolution 
services from the Office of Government Information 
Services as a nonexclusive alternative to litigation.”  This 
notice will be provided in addition to the ongoing prac-
tice of informing the requester of the right to seek judi-
cial review.   

Secretary’s note:  The amended Rules adopted 
at this meeting were published in the Federal Reg-
ister as a final rule on October 2, 2017, and will 
go into effect 30 days following publication. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets over the period since the July 
FOMC meeting.  Yields on longer-term Treasury secu-
rities had fallen modestly, the foreign exchange value of 
the dollar had declined, and broad equity price indexes 
had increased.  Survey responses suggested that the vast 
majority of market participants expected the FOMC to 
announce a change in SOMA reinvestment policy at this 
meeting and that nearly all market participants antici-
pated that the FOMC would also leave the target range 
for the federal funds rate unchanged. 

The deputy manager followed with a report on develop-
ments in money markets and open market operations 
over the intermeeting period.  The effective federal 
funds rate remained near the center of the FOMC’s tar-
get range except on month-ends.  Take-up at the Sys-
tem’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility av-
eraged somewhat less than in the previous period.  The 
deputy manager provided updates on developments 
with respect to reference interest rates and on small-
value tests of open market operations, which are con-
ducted routinely to promote operational readiness.  The 
deputy manager also summarized the results of the 
staff’s annual review of foreign reserves investment and 
its recommendations to the Foreign Currency Subcom-
mittee for key parameters for foreign reserves invest-
ment for the forthcoming year, and the deputy manager 

4 In compliance with the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the 
earlier version of the Rules was published in the Federal Register 
as an interim final rule on December 27, 2016.

noted that the Subcommittee would welcome any input 
from the Committee regarding those parameters. 

Secretary’s note:  On September 27, 2017, the 
Foreign Currency Subcommittee provided to 
the Federal Reserve Bank selected to conduct 
open market operations instructions that incor-
porated the staff recommendations for key pa-
rameters for foreign reserves investment. 

Finally, the manager reviewed details of the operational 
approach that the Open Market Desk planned to follow 
if the Committee decided at this meeting to initiate the 
proposal for SOMA reinvestment policy described in 
the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum to the Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the September 19–20 
meeting showed that labor market conditions continued 
to strengthen in July and August and that real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a moder-
ate pace in the third quarter before the landfall of Hur-
ricanes Harvey and Irma.  Only limited data pertaining 
to the economic effects of these hurricanes were availa-
ble at the time of the meeting, but it appeared likely that 
the negative effects would restrain national economic ac-
tivity only in the near term.5  Total consumer price infla-
tion, as measured by the 12-month change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
continued to run below 2 percent in July and was lower 
than at the start of the year.  Survey-based measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on 
balance. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July 
and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and 
declines in government employment.  The unemploy-
ment rate dipped to 4.3 percent in July and edged back 
up to 4.4 percent in August.  The unemployment rates 
for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites 
were lower, on average, in recent months than around 
the start of the year, whereas the unemployment rate for 
Asians was a little higher.  The overall labor force partic-

                                                 
5 The background materials prepared by the staff for this 
meeting were completed before the full effects of Hurricane 
Maria were evident. 

ipation rate edged up in July and was unchanged in Au-
gust, and the share of workers employed part time for 
economic reasons was little changed on net.  The rate of 
private-sector job openings increased in June and July, 
the hiring rate ticked up, and the quits rate edged down.  
Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits 
jumped in early September from a very low level, and the 
Department of Labor noted that Hurricane Harvey had 
an effect on claims.  Changes in measures of labor com-
pensation were mixed.  Compensation per hour rose just 
1¼ percent over the four quarters ending in the second 
quarter of 2017 (partly reflecting a significant downward 
revision to compensation per hour in the second half of 
2016), the employment cost index for private workers 
increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in 
June, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 
2½ percent over the 12 months ending in August. 

Total industrial production (IP) increased for a sixth 
consecutive month in July but then declined sharply in 
August.  The decrease in August largely reflected the 
temporary effects of Hurricane Harvey on drilling, ser-
vicing, and extraction activity for oil and natural gas and 
on output in several manufacturing industries that are 
concentrated in the Gulf Coast region, including petro-
leum refining, organic chemicals, and plastics materials 
and resins.  Production disruptions from Hurricane Har-
vey continued into September, and the effects of Hurri-
cane Irma were anticipated to hold down IP in that 
month as well.  Even so, anecdotal reports from the  
hurricane-affected regions, as well as daily data on capac-
ity outages in selected Gulf Coast industries, indicated 
that production had already started to recover.  Mean-
while, automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that 
motor vehicle production would move up, on balance, 
over the remainder of the year despite a somewhat ele-
vated level of dealers’ inventories and a slowing in the 
pace of vehicle sales in recent months.  Broader indica-
tors of manufacturing production, such as the new or-
ders indexes from national and regional manufacturing 
surveys, continued to point to moderate gains in factory 
output over the near term. 

Several pieces of information suggested that real PCE 
was likely increasing at a slower rate in the third quarter 
than in the second.  First, the components of the nomi-
nal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE declined in Au-
gust and were revised down in June and July.  Second,

the pace of light motor vehicle sales moved lower, on 
net, in July and August.  Third, Hurricanes Harvey and 
Irma appeared likely to temporarily reduce consumer 
spending.  However, recent readings on key factors that 
influence consumer spending—including continued 
gains in employment, real disposable personal income, 
and households’ net worth—remained supportive of 
solid growth in real PCE.  Consumer sentiment, as meas-
ured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consum-
ers, was upbeat through early September. 

Recent information on housing activity suggested that 
real residential investment spending was decreasing in 
the third quarter after declining in the second quarter.  
Starts for new single-family homes edged down, on net, 
in July and August, and starts for multifamily units 
moved lower in both months.  Building permit issuance 
for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good 
indicator of the underlying trend in construction—de-
clined in July and August.  Sales of both new and existing 
homes decreased in July. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to be increasing at a solid 
rate in the third quarter.  Nominal orders and shipments 
of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose over 
the two months ending in July, and readings on business 
sentiment remained upbeat.  In contrast, investment in 
nonresidential structures was poised to decline in the 
third quarter.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresiden-
tial structures excluding drilling and mining fell sharply 
in June and July, and the number of oil and gas rigs in 
operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the 
drilling and mining sector, leveled out in the past couple 
of months after increasing steadily for the past year. 

Total real government purchases looked to be roughly 
flat, on balance, in the third quarter.  Nominal outlays 
for defense in July and August pointed to a small in-
crease in real federal government purchases in the third 
quarter.  However, payrolls for state and local govern-
ments declined in July and August, and nominal con-
struction spending by these governments decreased in 
July. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed 
substantially in June and was about unchanged in July.  
After increasing in June, exports retraced a bit of this 
gain in July, with lower exports of consumer goods, au-
tomotive products, and services.  Imports decreased a 
little in both months.  The available data suggested that 
net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth 
in the third quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased nearly 1½ percent over the 
12 months ending in July.  Core PCE price inflation, 
which excludes consumer food and energy prices, also 
was about 1½ percent over that same period.  Over the 
12 months ending in August, the consumer price index 
(CPI) increased almost 2 percent, while core CPI infla-
tion was 1¾ percent.  Retail gasoline prices moved up 
sharply following the landfall of Hurricane Harvey and 
appeared likely to put temporary upward pressure on the 
12-month change in total PCE prices.  The median of 
inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from 
the Michigan survey edged back up in the preliminary 
reading for September, and the median expectation for 
PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Sur-
vey of Professional Forecasters edged down.  The medi-
ans of longer-run inflation expectations from the Desk’s 
Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic-
ipants were relatively little changed in September. 

Foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid 
pace.  Economic growth picked up in the advanced for-
eign economies (AFEs) in the second quarter, especially 
in Canada, and incoming indicators suggested that 
growth slowed in the third quarter but remained firm.  
Recent indicators from the emerging market economies 
(EMEs) also pointed to continued strong economic 
growth, notwithstanding some slowing in the rate of ex-
pansion of activity in China.  Headline inflation in most 
AFEs remained subdued, held down in part by falling 
retail energy prices, but data through August suggested 
that the drag from energy prices was diminishing.  Infla-
tion also remained low in most EMEs, although food 
prices continued to put upward pressure on inflation in 
Mexico. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial market conditions remained gener-
ally accommodative over the intermeeting period.  U.S. 
equity prices increased, longer-term Treasury yields de-
clined, and the dollar depreciated.  Investors’ interpreta-
tions of FOMC communications, market perceptions of 
a reduced likelihood of U.S. fiscal policy changes, and 
heightened geopolitical risks all reportedly placed down-
ward pressure on longer-term yields.  At the same time, 
financing conditions for households and nonfinancial 
businesses continued to provide support for growth in 
spending and investment. 

FOMC communications over the intermeeting period 
reportedly were interpreted as indicating a somewhat 
slower pace of increases in the target range for the fed-

eral funds rate than previously expected.  Market partic-
ipants were attentive to the Committee’s assessment of 
recent below-expectations inflation data and the ac-
knowledgment in the July FOMC minutes that inflation 
might continue to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective for longer than anticipated.  Investors also 
took note of the Committee’s guidance in the July 
FOMC statement that it expected to begin implementing 
its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon.  
By the end of the intermeeting period, market partici-
pants appeared nearly certain that the Committee would 
announce the implementation of its balance sheet nor-
malization plan at the September meeting.  The proba-
bility of an increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate occurring at either the September or the No-
vember meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds 
futures contracts, fell to essentially zero, while the prob-
ability of a 25 basis point increase by the end of the year 
stood near 50 percent and was little changed since the 
July meeting.  Quotes on overnight index swaps (OIS) 
pointed to a slight flattening of the expected path of the 
federal funds rate through 2020, with a staff model at-
tributing most of the declines in OIS rates to lower ex-
pected rates. 

Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treas-
ury securities decreased modestly over the intermeeting 
period.  Treasury yields fell following the July FOMC 
meeting, reflecting the response of investors to the 
postmeeting statement, and then dropped further amid 
rising geopolitical tensions related to North Korea and 
market perceptions of reduced prospects for enactment 
of a fiscal stimulus program.  Economic data releases ap-
peared to have little net effect on Treasury yields over 
most of the period.  A staff term structure model at-
tributed about half of the decline in the 10-year Treasury 
yield to a decrease in the average expected future short-
term rate and the remaining half to a lower term pre-
mium.  Measures of inflation compensation over the 
next 5 years rose modestly, on net, partly in response to 
the release of higher-than-expected CPI data for August, 
while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was lit-
tle changed. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the inter-
meeting period.  One-month-ahead option-implied vol-
atility of the S&P 500 index—the VIX—remained at his-
torically low levels despite brief spikes associated with 
increased investor concerns about geopolitical tensions 
and political uncertainties.  Over the intermeeting pe-
riod, spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-
grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on  
comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened a bit. 

Short-dated Treasury bill yields were elevated for a time, 
reflecting concerns about potential delays in raising the 
federal debt limit.  However, following news of an agree-
ment to extend the debt ceiling by three months, rates 
on Treasury bills maturing in October retraced their en-
tire increase from early in the intermeeting period.  Con-
ditions in other domestic short-term funding markets 
were stable.  Yields on a broad set of money market in-
struments remained in the ranges observed since the 
FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds 
rate in June.  Daily take-up at the System’s overnight re-
verse repurchase agreement facility ran somewhat lower 
than in the previous intermeeting period. 

Since the July FOMC meeting, asset price movements in 
global financial markets were driven by geopolitical ten-
sions in the Korean peninsula, improving economic pro-
spects abroad, communications from AFE central 
banks, and changes in prospects for fiscal policy legisla-
tion in the United States.  The broad index of the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar decreased 1½ percent; the 
decline was widespread, led by the strengthening of the 
euro and the Chinese renminbi.  The Canadian dollar ap-
preciated following a rate hike by the Bank of Canada at 
its September meeting that came sooner than market 
participants expected.  Similarly, sterling appreciated af-
ter the Bank of England signaled a potential rate hike in 
the coming months.  Against this backdrop, longer-term 
yields rose slightly in Canada and the United Kingdom.  
In contrast, longer-term German yields declined moder-
ately, despite better-than-expected economic data re-
leases for the euro area, as market expectations shifted 
toward a more gradual withdrawal of stimulus by the Eu-
ropean Central Bank (ECB) even though the ECB kept 
its policy stance unchanged. 

Despite generally better-than-expected earnings releases, 
AFE equity prices were mixed over the period, with 
bank stocks underperforming broader indexes.  Outside 
South Korea, most emerging market asset prices were 
little affected by the recent escalation of geopolitical con-
cerns.  Net flows to emerging market mutual funds 
briefly turned negative in early August, but they quickly 
returned to near the high levels seen since early this year.  
Yield spreads on EME sovereign bonds edged down. 

Financing conditions for U.S. nonfinancial businesses 
continued to be accommodative.  Issuance of corporate 
debt and equity was strong in July and August.  Gross 
issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued its ro-
bust pace in June but slowed notably in July, as is typical 
during the summer.  Meanwhile, the growth of commer-
cial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books ticked up

in July and August compared with its pace over the first 
half of the year; however, C&I loan growth from the 
fourth quarter of last year through August remained sig-
nificantly lower than over recent years. 

Gross issuance of municipal bonds was strong in Au-
gust, and spreads of yields on municipal bonds over 
those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities in-
creased a bit over the intermeeting period.  The credit 
quality of state and local governments improved overall, 
as the number of ratings upgrades notably outpaced the 
number of downgrades in August. 

The growth of commercial real estate (CRE) loans on 
banks’ books continued to moderate in July and August, 
reflecting a slowdown in lending both for nonfarm non-
residential units and for construction and land develop-
ment; nonetheless, CRE financing appeared to remain 
broadly available.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) so far this year was similar to 
that in the same period a year earlier.  Spreads on CMBS 
over Treasury securities narrowed a little over the inter-
meeting period and were near the bottom of their ranges 
of the past several years.  Delinquency rates on loans in 
CMBS pools declined slightly but remained elevated for 
loans that were originated before the financial crisis. 

Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages 
moved lower over the intermeeting period, in line with 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields.  Growth in mort-
gage lending for home purchases picked up in July and 
August compared with its pace over the second quarter.  
However, credit conditions remained tight for borrow-
ers with low credit scores or hard-to-document incomes. 

Consumer credit continued to be readily available for 
most borrowers, and overall loan balances rose at a mod-
erate pace in the second quarter, reflecting further ex-
pansions in credit card, auto, and student loan balances.  
Issuance of asset-backed securities remained robust over 
the year to date and outpaced that of the previous year, 
providing support for consumer lending.  However, 
standards and terms on auto and credit card loans were 
tighter for subprime borrowers, likely in response to ris-
ing delinquencies on such loans.  Subprime auto loan 
balances have declined so far this year, partly reflecting 
the tighter lending standards, and the average credit 
score of all borrowers who obtained an auto loan in the 
second quarter remained near the upper end of its range 
of the past few years. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to 

the previous forecast.  Real GDP was expected to rise at 
a solid pace, on net, in the second half of the year, and 
by a little more than previously projected, reflecting data 
on spending that were stronger than expected on bal-
ance.  The short-term disruptions to spending and pro-
duction associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 
were expected to reduce real GDP growth in the third 
quarter and to boost it in the fourth quarter as produc-
tion returned to its pre-hurricane path and as a portion 
of the lost spending was made up.  The hurricanes were 
also expected to depress payroll employment in Septem-
ber, with a reversal over the next few months.  Beyond 
2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised.  
In particular, the staff continued to project that real 
GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than po-
tential output through 2019.  The unemployment rate 
was projected to decline gradually over the next couple 
of years and to continue running below the staff’s esti-
mate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.  Be-
cause of continued subdued inflation readings and, given 
real GDP growth, a larger-than-expected decline in the 
unemployment rate over much of the past year, the staff 
revised down slightly its estimate of the longer-run nat-
ural rate of unemployment in this projection. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as 
measured by the change in the PCE price index, was re-
vised up somewhat for 2017 in response to hurricane-
related effects on gasoline prices.  The near-term fore-
cast for core PCE price inflation was essentially unre-
vised.  Total PCE price inflation this year was expected 
to run at the same pace as last year, with a slower increase 
in core PCE prices offset by a slightly larger increase in 
energy prices and an upturn in the prices for food and 
non-energy imports.  Beyond 2017, the inflation forecast 
was little revised from the previous projection.  The staff 
continued to project that inflation would edge higher in 
the next couple of years and that it would reach the 
Committee’s longer-run objective in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  On 
the one hand, many financial market indicators of uncer-
tainty remained subdued, and the uncertainty associated 
with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than 
last year; on the other hand, uncertainty about the direc-
tion of some economic policies was judged to have re-
mained elevated.  The staff saw the risks to the forecasts 
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as bal-
anced.  The risks to the projection for inflation were also 
seen as balanced.  Downside risks included the possibil-
ities that longer-term inflation expectations may have 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

edged down or that the recent run of soft inflation read-
ings could prove to be more persistent than the staff ex-
pected.  These downside risks were seen as essentially 
counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could 
increase more than expected in an economy that was 
projected to continue operating above its longer-run po-
tential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2020 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.6  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had been rising moderately so far this 
year.  Job gains had remained solid in recent months, and 
the unemployment rate had stayed low.  Household 
spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and 
growth in business fixed investment had picked up in 
recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation 
and the measure excluding food and energy prices had 
declined this year and were running below 2 percent.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation re-
mained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations were little changed on balance. 

Participants acknowledged that Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria would affect economic activity in the 
near term.  They expected growth of real GDP in the 
third quarter to be held down by the severe disruptions 
caused by the storms but to rebound beginning in the 
fourth quarter as rebuilding got under way and economic 
activity in the affected areas resumed.  Similarly, employ-
ment would be temporarily depressed by the hurricanes, 
                                                 
6 Four members of the Board of Governors, the same number 
as in June 2017, were in office at the time of the September 
2017 meeting.  The office of the president of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Richmond was vacant at the time of both 

but, abstracting from those effects, employment gains 
were anticipated to remain solid, and the unemployment 
rate was expected to decline a bit further by year-end. 

Based on the estimated effects of past major hurricanes 
that made landfall in the United States, participants 
judged that the recent storms were unlikely to materially 
alter the course of the national economy over the me-
dium term.  Moreover, they generally viewed the infor-
mation on spending, production, and labor market ac-
tivity that became available over the intermeeting period, 
which was mostly not affected by the hurricanes, as sug-
gesting little change in the outlook for economic growth 
and the labor market over the medium term.  Conse-
quently, they continued to expect that, with gradual ad-
justments in the stance of monetary policy, economic ac-
tivity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  In the 
aftermath of the hurricanes, higher prices for gasoline 
and some other items were likely to boost inflation tem-
porarily.  Apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month 
basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent 
in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term 
risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly bal-
anced, but participants agreed to continue to monitor in-
flation developments closely. 

Consumer spending had been expanding at a moderate 
rate through the summer, and reports on retail activity 
from participants’ contacts were generally positive.  Par-
ticipants expected some fluctuations in consumer spend-
ing to result from the hurricanes, but they generally 
judged that consumption growth would continue to be 
supported by still-solid fundamental determinants of 
household spending, including the income generated by 
the ongoing strength in the labor market, improved 
household balance sheets, and high levels of consumer 
confidence.  Sales of autos and light trucks had softened 
over the summer, leading producers to slow production 
to address a buildup of inventories, but a couple of par-
ticipants noted that automakers expected to see a tem-
porary increase in demand as households and businesses 
replaced vehicles damaged during the storms. 

Incoming data on business spending showed that equip-
ment investment had picked up during 2017 after having 
been weak during much of 2016.  Shipments and orders 

FOMC meetings; First Vice President Mark L. Mullinix sub-
mitted economic projections.  One participant did not submit 
longer-run projections for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, or the federal funds rate.

of nondefense capital goods had been on a steady up-
trend over the first eight months of 2017.  A number of 
participants reported that their business contacts ap-
peared to have become more confident about the eco-
nomic outlook, and it was noted that the National Fed-
eration of Independent Business reported that greater 
optimism among small businesses had contributed to a 
sharp increase in the proportion of small firms planning 
increases in their capital expenditures.  A couple of par-
ticipants commented that competitive pressures and 
tight labor markets were increasing the incentives for 
businesses to substitute capital for labor or to invest in 
information technology.  In contrast, reports on the 
strength of nonresidential construction were mixed.  
And in energy-producing regions, the count of drilling 
rigs in operation had begun to level off before the onset 
of Hurricane Harvey. 

Participants generally indicated that, before the recent 
hurricanes, business activity in their Districts was ex-
panding at a moderate pace.  Although industrial pro-
duction in areas affected by the storms was estimated to 
have declined in August, a number of participants from 
other areas reported further solid gains in manufacturing 
activity in their Districts.  Participants from the regions 
affected by the hurricanes reported that businesses in 
their Districts anticipated that the disruptions to busi-
ness and sales would be relatively short lived.  In the en-
ergy sector, Hurricane Harvey had shut down drilling 
and refining activity, but by the time of the meeting, 
these operations had substantially resumed.  And many 
business contacts in the affected areas reported that they 
expected their operations to return to normal before the 
end of the year.  Farming in some parts of the country 
had been affected by drought, and income in the agricul-
tural sector was under downward pressure because of 
low crop prices. 

Overall, the available information suggested that, al-
though the storms would likely affect the quarterly pat-
tern of changes in real GDP at least through the second 
half of the year, economic activity would continue to ex-
pand at a moderate rate over the medium term, sup-
ported by further gains in consumer spending and the 
pickup in business investment.  In addition, improving 
global economic conditions and the depreciation of the 
dollar in recent months were anticipated to result in a 
modest positive contribution to domestic economic ac-
tivity from net exports.  In contrast, most participants 
had not assumed enactment of a fiscal stimulus package 
in their economic projections or had marked down the 
expected magnitude of any stimulus. 

Labor market conditions strengthened further in recent 
months.  The increases in nonfarm payroll employment 
in July and August remained well above the pace likely 
to be sustainable in the longer run.  Although the unem-
ployment rate was little changed from March to August, 
it remained below participants’ estimates of its longer-
run normal level.  Other indicators suggested that labor 
market conditions had continued to tighten over recent 
quarters.  The labor force participation rate had been 
moving sideways despite factors, such as demographic 
changes, that were contributing to a declining longer-run 
trend.  In addition, the number of individuals working 
part time for economic reasons, as a share of household 
employment, had moved lower.  The job openings rate, 
the quits rate, households’ assessments of job availabil-
ity, and the labor market conditions index prepared by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had returned 
to pre-recession levels.  However, some participants still 
saw room for further increases in labor utilization, with 
a couple of them noting that the employment-to- 
population ratio and the participation rate for prime-age 
workers had not fully recovered to pre-recession levels. 

Against the backdrop of the continued strengthening in 
labor market conditions, participants discussed recent 
wage developments.  Increases in most aggregate 
measures of hourly wages and labor compensation re-
mained subdued, and several participants commented 
that the absence of broad-based upward wage pressures 
suggested that the sustainable rate of unemployment 
might be lower than they currently estimated.  Other fac-
tors that may have been contributing to the subdued 
pace of wage increases reported in the national data in-
cluded low productivity growth, changes in the compo-
sition of the workforce, and competitive pressure on 
employers to hold down their costs.  However, reports 
from business contacts in several Districts indicated that 
employers in labor markets in which demand was high 
or in which workers in some occupations were in short 
supply were raising wages noticeably to compete for 
workers and limit turnover.  It was noted that the ex-
pected increase in demand for skilled construction work-
ers for reconstruction in hurricane-affected areas would 
likely exacerbate existing shortages.  Most participants 
expected wage increases to pick up over time as the labor 
market strengthened further; a couple of participants 
cautioned that a broader acceleration in wages may al-
ready have begun, consistent with already-tight labor 
market conditions. 

Based on the available data, PCE price inflation over the 
12 months ending in August was estimated to be about 
1½ percent, remaining below the Committee’s longer-

run objective.  In their review of the recent data and the 
outlook for inflation, participants discussed a number of 
factors that could be contributing to the low readings on 
consumer prices this year and weighed the extent to 
which those factors might be transitory or could prove 
more persistent.  Many participants continued to believe 
that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening la-
bor market or an economy operating above its potential 
were likely to show through to higher inflation over the 
medium term.  In addition, many judged that at least part 
of the softening in inflation this year was the result of 
idiosyncratic or one-time factors, and, thus, their effects 
were likely to fade over time.  However, other develop-
ments, such as the effects of earlier changes to govern-
ment health-care programs that had been holding down 
health-care costs, might continue to do so for some time.  
Some participants discussed the possibility that secular 
trends, such as the influence of technological innova-
tions on competition and business pricing, also might 
have been muting inflationary pressures and could be in-
tensifying.  It was noted that other advanced economies 
were also experiencing low inflation, which might sug-
gest that common global factors could be contributing 
to persistence of below-target inflation in the United 
States and abroad.  Several participants commented on 
the importance of longer-run inflation expectations to 
the outlook for a return of inflation to 2 percent.  A 
number of indicators of inflation expectations, including 
survey statistics and estimates derived from financial 
market data, were generally viewed as indicating that 
longer-run inflation expectations remained reasonably 
stable, although a few participants saw some of these 
measures as low or slipping. 

Participants raised a number of important considera-
tions about the implications of persistently low inflation 
for the path of the federal funds rate over the medium 
run.  Several expressed concern that the persistence of 
low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying 
trend was running below 2 percent, risking a decline in 
inflation expectations.  If so, the appropriate policy path 
should take into account the need to bolster inflation ex-
pectations in order to ensure that inflation returned to 
2 percent and to prevent erosion in the credibility of the 
Committee’s objective.  It was also noted that the per-
sistence of low inflation might result in the federal funds 
rate staying uncomfortably close to its effective lower 
bound.  However, a few others pointed out the need to 
consider the lags in the response of inflation to tighten-
ing resource utilization and, thus, increasing upside risks 
to inflation as the labor market tightened further. 

On balance, participants continued to forecast that PCE 
price inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 
2 percent objective over the medium term.  However, 
several noted that in preparing their projections for this 
meeting, they had taken on board the likelihood that 
convergence to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
inflation objective might take somewhat longer than 
they anticipated earlier.  Participants generally agreed it 
would be important to monitor inflation developments 
closely.  Several of them noted that interpreting the next 
few inflation reports would likely be complicated by the 
temporary run-up in energy costs and in the prices of 
other items affected by storm-related disruptions and re-
building. 

In financial markets, longer-term interest rates and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar declined over the 
intermeeting period, and equity prices increased.  It was 
noted that U.S. financial conditions recently appeared to 
be responding as much or more to economic and finan-
cial news from abroad as to domestic developments.  
Many participants viewed accommodative financial con-
ditions, which had prevailed even as the Committee 
raised the federal funds rate, as likely to provide support 
for the economic expansion.  However, a couple of 
those participants expressed concern that the persis-
tence of highly accommodative financial conditions 
could, over time, pose risks to financial stability.  In con-
trast, a few participants cautioned that these financial 
market conditions might not deliver much impetus to 
aggregate demand if they instead reflected a more pessi-
mistic assessment of prospects for longer-run economic 
growth and, accordingly, a view that the longer-run neu-
tral rate of interest in the United States would remain 
low. 

In their discussion of monetary policy, all participants 
agreed that the economy had evolved broadly as they 
had anticipated at the time of the June meeting and that 
the incoming data had not materially altered the me-
dium-term economic outlook.  Consistent with those as-
sessments, participants saw it as appropriate, at this 
meeting, to announce implementation of the plan for re-
ducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings that the 
Committee released in June.  Many underscored that the 
reduction in securities holdings would be gradual and 
that financial market participants appeared to have a 
clear understanding of the Committee’s planned ap-
proach for a gradual normalization of the size of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Consequently, partici-
pants generally expected that any reaction in financial 
markets to the start of balance sheet normalization 
would likely be limited.

With the medium-term outlook little changed, inflation 
below 2 percent, and the neutral rate of interest esti-
mated to be quite low, all participants thought it would 
be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the cur-
rent target range for the federal funds rate at this meet-
ing, and nearly all supported again indicating in the 
postmeeting statement that a gradual approach to in-
creasing the federal funds rate will likely be warranted.  
Nevertheless, many participants expressed concern that 
the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only 
transitory factors, but also the influence of develop-
ments that could prove more persistent, and it was noted 
that some patience in removing policy accommodation 
while assessing trends in inflation was warranted.  A few 
of these participants thought that no further increases in 
the federal funds rate were called for in the near term or 
that the upward trajectory of the federal funds rate might 
appropriately be quite shallow.  Some other participants, 
however, were more worried about upside risks to infla-
tion arising from a labor market that had already reached 
full employment and was projected to tighten further.  
Their concerns were heightened by the apparent easing 
in financial conditions that had developed since the 
Committee’s policy normalization process was initiated 
in December 2015.  These participants cautioned that an 
unduly slow pace in removing policy accommodation 
could result in an overshoot of the Committee’s inflation 
objective in the medium term that would likely be costly 
to reverse or could lead to an intensification of financial 
stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove 
difficult to unwind.   

Consistent with the expectation that a gradual rise in the 
federal funds rate would be appropriate, many partici-
pants thought that another increase in the target range 
later this year was likely to be warranted if the medium-
term outlook remained broadly unchanged.  Several oth-
ers noted that, in light of the uncertainty around their 
outlook for inflation, their decision on whether to take 
such a policy action would depend importantly on 
whether the economic data in coming months increased 
their confidence that inflation was moving up toward the 
Committee’s objective.  A few participants thought that 
additional increases in the federal funds rate should be 
deferred until incoming information confirmed that the 
low readings on inflation this year were not likely to per-
sist and that inflation was clearly on a path toward the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the me-
dium term.  All agreed that they would closely monitor 
and assess incoming data before making any further ad-
justment to the federal funds rate. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in July indicated that the labor mar-
ket had continued to strengthen and that economic ac-
tivity had been rising moderately so far this year.  Job 
gains had remained solid in recent months, and the un-
employment rate had stayed low.  Household spending 
had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in 
business fixed investment had picked up in recent quar-
ters.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the 
measure excluding food and energy prices had declined 
this year and were running below 2 percent.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation remained 
low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation ex-
pectations were little changed on balance. 

Members noted that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Ma-
ria had devastated many communities, inflicting severe 
hardship.  Members judged that storm-related disrup-
tions and rebuilding would affect economic activity in 
the near term, but past experience suggested that the 
hurricanes were unlikely to materially alter the course of 
the national economy over the medium term.  Conse-
quently, the Committee continued to expect that, with 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, 
economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and 
labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat 
further.  Higher prices for gasoline and some other items 
in the aftermath of the hurricanes would likely boost in-
flation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 
12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat be-
low 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  
Members saw near-term risks to the economic outlook 
as roughly balanced, but they agreed to continue to mon-
itor inflation developments closely. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent.  They noted that the 
stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor 
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent in-
flation. 

Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
would depend on their assessment of realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  They expected that economic conditions would

evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate 
was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that 
were expected to prevail in the longer run.  Members 
also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds 
rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed 
by incoming data.  In particular, they reaffirmed that 
they would carefully monitor actual and expected infla-
tion developments relative to the Committee’s symmet-
ric inflation goal.  Some members emphasized that, in 
considering the timing of further adjustments in the fed-
eral funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming infor-
mation to assess the likelihood that recent low readings 
on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again 
on a trajectory consistent with achieving the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. 

Members agreed that, in October, the Committee would 
initiate the balance sheet normalization program de-
scribed in the June 2017 Addendum to the Policy Nor-
malization Principles and Plans.  Several members ob-
served that, in part because financial market participants 
appeared to have a clear understanding of the Commit-
tee’s plan for gradually reducing the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings, any reaction in financial markets to 
the announcement and implementation of the program 
would likely be limited. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective September 21, 2017, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 1 to 1¼ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 1.00 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction Treasury securities ma-

turing during September, and to continue rein-
vesting in agency mortgage-backed securities 
the principal payments received through Sep-
tember from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities. 

Effective in October 2017, the Committee di-
rects the Desk to roll over at auction the 
amount of principal payments from the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities matur-
ing during each calendar month that exceeds 
$6 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgage-
backed securities the amount of principal pay-
ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities received during each calendar month that 
exceeds $4 billion.  Small deviations from these 
amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in July indicates that the 
labor market has continued to strengthen and 
that economic activity has been rising moder-
ately so far this year.  Job gains have remained 
solid in recent months, and the unemployment 
rate has stayed low.  Household spending has 
been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth 
in business fixed investment has picked up in 
recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis, overall 
inflation and the measure excluding food and 
energy prices have declined this year and are 
running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remain low; 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations are little changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, 
and Maria have devastated many communities, 
inflicting severe hardship.  Storm-related dis-
ruptions and rebuilding will affect economic ac-
tivity in the near term, but past experience sug-
gests that the storms are unlikely to materially

alter the course of the national economy over 
the medium term.  Consequently, the Commit-
tee continues to expect that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, eco-
nomic activity will expand at a moderate pace, 
and labor market conditions will strengthen 
somewhat further.  Higher prices for gasoline 
and some other items in the aftermath of the 
hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporar-
ily; apart from that effect, inflation on a  
12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat 
below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize 
around the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the 
economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but 
the Committee is monitoring inflation develop-
ments closely. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a sustained re-
turn to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 

gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

In October, the Committee will initiate the bal-
ance sheet normalization program described in 
the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee’s 
Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel 
Kashkari, and Jerome H. Powell. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-
changed at 1¼ percent and voted unanimously to ap-
prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount 
rate) at the existing level of 1¾ percent.7 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 31–
November 1, 2017.  The meeting adjourned at 
10:05 a.m. on September 20, 2017. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on August 15, 2017, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on July 25–26, 2017.

Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 19–20, 2017, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 
2020 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s pro-
jections were based on information available at the time 
of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of 
appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the 
federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and as-
sumptions about other factors likely to affect economic 
outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each 
participant’s assessment of the value to which each var-
iable would be expected to converge, over time, under 
appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of fur-
ther shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her 
individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices. 

All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year 
would run somewhat above their individual estimates of 
its longer-run rate.  Almost all participants projected that 
economic growth would moderate over the next three 
years, and almost all projected that real GDP growth in 
2019 and 2020 would be at or close to their individual 
estimates of the economy’s longer-run potential growth 
rate.  All participants who submitted longer-run projec-
tions expected that the unemployment rate would run 
below their estimates of its longer-run normal level in 
2017, and almost all projected that the unemployment 
rate would remain below their estimates of its longer-run 
level through 2020.  All participants projected that infla-
tion, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change 
in the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures (PCE), would run below 2 percent in 2017 and 

                                                 
1 Four members of the Board of Governors, the same number 
as in June 2017, were in office at the time of the September 
2017 meeting.  As in June 2017, the office of the president of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was vacant at the time 
of this FOMC meeting; First Vice President Mark L. Mullinix 
again submitted economic projections.   
2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate.  This participant’s projections over the next several 
years were informed by the view that the U.S. economy is 

then step up in the next three years; about half of them 
projected that inflation would be at the Committee’s 
2 percent objective in 2019 and 2020, and all judged that 
inflation would be within a couple of tenths of a percent-
age point of the objective in those years.  Most partici-
pants commented on the effects of Hurricanes Harvey 
and Irma and judged that there would likely be some ef-
fect on national economic activity and inflation in the 
near term but little effect in the medium term.3  Table 1 
and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projec-
tions. 

As shown in figure 2, participants generally expected 
that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant 
further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to 
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  Although some participants lowered their 
federal funds rate projections since June, the median 
projections for the federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018 
were unchanged; the median projection for 2019 was 
slightly lower, and the median projection for the longer-
run normal level of the federal funds rate edged down.  
However, because of considerable uncertainty about 
how the economy will evolve, the actual path of short-
term interest rates, including the federal funds rate, can 
differ substantially from projections. 

In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached 
to their economic projections as broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years, and all participants saw the 
uncertainty associated with their forecasts for real GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as un-
changed from June.  Most participants judged the risks 
around their projections for economic growth, the un-
employment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-
sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 
2.4 percent in 2017, about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, 

characterized by multiple medium-term regimes, that these re-
gimes are persistent, and that optimal monetary policy is re-
gime dependent.  Because switches between regimes are diffi-
cult to predict and affect the longer-run outlook, this partici-
pant’s forecast did not incorporate convergence to longer-
term outcomes for variables other than inflation. 
3 Participants had completed their submissions for the Sum-
mary of Economic Projections before the full effects of Hur-
ricane Maria were evident.

and 1.8 percent in 2020; the median of projections for 
the longer-run normal rate of real GDP growth was 
1.8 percent.  Compared with the June Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections (SEP), the median of the forecasts for 
real GDP growth for 2017 was a bit higher, while the 
medians for 2018 and 2019, as well as the median assess-
ment of the longer-run growth rate, were mostly un-
changed.  Most participants did not incorporate expec-
tations of fiscal stimulus in their projections.  Several 
participants who included some fiscal stimulus indicated 
that they had marked down its expected magnitude rela-
tive to their June projections. 

The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.3 percent, unchanged 
from June and 0.3 percentage point below the median 
assessment of its longer-run normal level.  The medians 
of the unemployment rate projections for 2018 through 
2020 were a little above 4 percent.  The median estimate 
of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 
4.6 percent, unchanged from June.   

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP 
growth for this year shifted up, with half of the partici-
pants now expecting real GDP growth of 2.4 or 2.5 per-
cent and none seeing it below 2.2 percent.  The distribu-
tion of projected real GDP growth in 2018 also shifted 
up a bit, while the distributions in 2019 and in the longer 
run were broadly similar to the distributions of the June 
projections.  The distributions of individual projections 
for the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 shifted 
down slightly. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
The median of projections for headline PCE inflation 
was 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 
2 percent in 2019 and 2020, about unchanged from June.  
Most participants anticipated that inflation would con-
tinue to run slightly below 2 percent in 2018, while no 
participants expected inflation above 2 percent in that 
year.  About half projected that inflation would be equal 
to the Committee’s objective in 2019 and 2020; others 
projected that inflation would run a little above or below 
the Committee’s objective in one or both of those years.  
The median of projections for core PCE inflation was 
1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.9 percent in 2018, a decline of 
0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point from 
June, respectively.  The median projection for core PCE 
inflation in 2019 and 2020 was 2.0 percent. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of projections for headline 
PCE inflation and for core PCE inflation in 2017 moved 
down somewhat from June, and the distributions for 
both measures in 2018 shifted down slightly.  Most par-
ticipants indicated that the soft readings on inflation so 
far this year were a factor contributing to the revisions 
in their inflation forecasts. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint 
of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end 
of each year from 2017 to 2020 and over the longer run.  
The distributions for 2017 and 2018 became somewhat 
less dispersed compared with those in June.  Even 
though the range of the distribution in 2019 was nar-
rower than in June, other measures of dispersion were 
roughly unchanged.  The median projections of the fed-
eral funds rate continued to show gradual increases, with 
the median assessment for 2017 standing at 1.38 per-
cent, consistent with three 25 basis point increases this 
year.  Thereafter, the medians of the projections were 
2.13 percent at the end of 2018, 2.69 percent at the end 
of 2019, and 2.88 percent at the end of 2020.  Compared 
with their projections prepared for the June SEP, some 
participants reduced their projection for the federal 
funds rate in the longer run; the median declined 
0.25 percentage point, to 2.75 percent. 

In discussing their September projections, many partici-
pants again expressed the view that the appropriate up-
ward trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next 
few years would likely be gradual.  That anticipated pace 
reflected a few factors, including a neutral real interest 
rate that was currently low and was expected to move up 
only slowly as well as a gradual return of inflation to the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Some participants 
judged that a slightly lower path of the federal funds rate 
than in their previous projections would likely be appro-
priate, with a few citing a slower rate of progress toward 
the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective than pre-
viously expected or reduced prospects for fiscal stimu-
lus.  In their discussions of appropriate monetary policy, 
some of the participants mentioned their assumptions 
for the Committee’s reinvestment policy; all of those 
who did so anticipated that the Committee would begin 
its program of balance sheet normalization, described in 
the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles 
and Plans released in June, before the end of this year.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root

leased in the fall by various private and government forecasters.  As de-
scribed in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, 
unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in 
ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past.  
For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), 
“Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical 
Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Eco-
nomics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, February), www.federalreserve.gov/

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth 
quarter basis. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the 
fourth quarter. 

 

Uncertainty and Risks 
The future outcomes of economic variables are subject 
to considerable uncertainty.  In assessing the path of 
monetary policy that, in their view, is likely to be most 
appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the 
range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of 
those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs 
should they occur.  Table 2 provides one measure of 
forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the un-
employment rate, and total consumer price inflation—
the root mean squared error (RMSE) from forecast er-
rors of various private and government projections 
made over the past 20 years.  This measure of forecast 
uncertainty is incorporated graphically in the top panels 
of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C, which display “fan charts” 
plotting the median SEP projections for the three varia-
bles surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals de-
rived from the RMSEs presented in table 2.  The width 
of the confidence interval for each variable at a given 
point is a measure of forecast uncertainty at that horizon.  
If the degree of uncertainty attending these projections 
is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors 

                                                 
4 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 

and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, future outcomes of these variables would have 
about a 70 percent probability of occurring within these 
confidence intervals.  For all three variables, this meas-
ure of forecast uncertainty is substantial and generally 
increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.   

FOMC participants may judge that the width of the his-
torical fan charts shown in figures 4.A through 4.C does 
not adequately capture their current assessments of the 
degree of uncertainty that surrounds their economic 
projections.  Participants’ assessments of the current 
level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projec-
tions are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 
4.B, and 4.C.  All or nearly all participants viewed the 
degree of uncertainty attached to their economic projec-
tions about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 
20 years, and all participants saw the degree of uncer-
tainty as unchanged from June.4  In their discussion of 
the uncertainty attached to their current projections, a 
few participants judged that near-term uncertainty for 
economic activity and inflation had increased as a result 
of the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma but com-
mented that their assessment of medium-term prospects 
was unaffected. 

The fan charts, which are constructed so as to be sym-
metric around the median projections, also may not fully 
reflect participants’ current assessments of the balance 
of risks to their economic projections.  Participants’ as-
sessments of the balance of risks to their economic pro-
jections are shown in the bottom-right panels of figures 
4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in June, most participants judged 
the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core infla-
tion as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly 
consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  One fewer par-
ticipant than in June judged the risks to GDP growth as 
weighted to the upside, and one fewer participant judged 
the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the 
downside.  Also, one fewer participant judged the risks 
to inflation to be weighted to the upside, and one more 
viewed the risks as weighted to the downside.  

Participants’ assessments of the future path of the fed-
eral funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also 
subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting in part un-
certainty about the evolution of GDP growth, the un-
employment rate, and inflation over time.  The final line 

the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter
of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is
based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more
information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,
on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the
historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around
their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who
judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view
the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of
the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly
balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of
uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of
the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around
the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private

Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width

participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are
summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as
“broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the
historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise,
participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around
their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the
box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

in table 2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of short-term 
interest rates.  These RMSEs are not strictly consistent 
with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, in 
part because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the 
most likely outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s 
individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  
However, the associated confidence intervals provide a 
sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of 
the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about 
the macroeconomic variables and additional adjust-

ments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to off-
set the effects of shocks to the economy.  To illustrate 
the uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for mon-
etary policy, figure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the me-
dian SEP projections for the federal funds rate sur-
rounded by confidence intervals derived from the results 
presented in table 2.  As with the macroeconomic varia-
bles, forecast uncertainty is substantial and increases at 
longer horizons.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.8 to 4.2 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 
4.9 percent in the second year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the third 
year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 0.9 to 
3.1 percent in the second year, 0.8 to 3.2 percent in the third 
year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the fourth year.  Figures 4.A 
through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan 
charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of 
FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation.  However, in some instances, 
the risks around the projections may not be symmetric.  In 
particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; fur-
thermore, the risks around a particular projection might be 
tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the 
corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned 
around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur- 

rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-
tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an  
end-of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should pro-
vide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the 
federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the mac-
roeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to 
monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the ef-
fects of shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
