Standing Repurchase Facility 
The staff briefed the Committee on the possible role of 
a standing fixed-rate repurchase agreement (repo) facility 
as part of the monetary policy implementation frame-
work; a facility of this type would allow counterparties 
to obtain temporary liquidity at a fixed rate of interest 
through repurchase transactions with the Federal Re-
serve involving their holdings of select securities eligible 
for open market operations.  The staff presentation 
noted how such a facility could provide a backstop 
against unusual spikes in the federal funds rate and other 
money market rates and might also provide incentives 
for banks to shift the composition of their portfolios of 
liquid assets away from reserves and toward high-quality 
securities.  Key design features for such a facility, includ-
ing the fixed rate offered to counterparties, the set of 
eligible counterparties, and the range of securities eligi-
ble to be placed at the facility, would influence the effec-
tiveness of a facility in achieving either of these objec-
tives.  The staff noted a number of considerations that 
could arise in setting these design parameters, including 
potential repercussions in unsecured and secured fund-

ing markets, the eligibility of counterparties in weak fi-
nancial condition, the potential that turning to such a fa-
cility could become stigmatized, and issues of a level 
playing field across different classes of counterparties.   

Participants commented on a number of issues in con-
nection with key design parameters for a repo facility.  In 
terms of the setting of the facility’s fixed rate, many par-
ticipants acknowledged a tradeoff in determining the 
level of the rate relative to other money market rates.  
On the one hand, establishing the rate at a narrow spread 
above money market rates would likely provide better 
interest rate control and could also be helpful in avoiding 
stigma that can be associated with the use of standing 
lending facilities with fixed rates set well above the level 
of money market rates.  On the other hand, setting the 
rate close to the level of money market rates could result 
in very sizable Federal Reserve operations on a daily ba-
sis that could be viewed as disintermediating the activity 
of private entities in money markets.  

In considering the eligible set of counterparties for a 
repo facility, a number of participants noted that making 
the facility available only to primary dealers would likely 
imply that the effects of the facility would be most direct 
on repo markets, while the influence on the federal 
funds market would be only indirect.  A couple of par-
ticipants noted that, particularly if banks were eligible 
counterparties, it would be important for counterparties 
of all sizes to have access to funding through the facility 
on the same terms.  A few participants noted that a fa-
cility could enhance financial stability by providing a 
means by which nonbank counterparties can readily ob-
tain liquidity against their high-quality assets.  A couple 
of other participants noted ways that a repo facility could 
have unintended effects on financial stability; for exam-
ple, if reserves help support overall financial stability, a 
facility that significantly reduced the demand for re-
serves might not be beneficial.   

Many participants commented on issues associated with 
the availability of such a facility to firms in different 
states of financial condition.  Several thought there 
should not be a guarantee of access to such a facility re-
gardless of a firm’s financial condition, while a number 
of others were willing to consider how such a facility 
could be structured to work effectively in a stressed en-
vironment where high-quality liquid assets were used as 
collateral.  A few participants noted that the availability 
of the facility to banks during periods of stress, particu-
larly when they might be in weak financial condition, 

could be an important factor determining whether a fa-
cility would significantly reduce banks’ demand for re-
serves in normal times. 

In their discussion of key objectives for establishing a 
repo facility, some participants raised questions about 
whether such a facility is needed in an ample-reserves 
framework, noting that the current ample-reserves re-
gime has provided good interest rate control.  Other par-
ticipants commented on the potential benefits of such a 
facility as a way to enhance interest rate control in the 
current implementation regime or as a means to operate 
in the current implementation framework but with a sig-
nificantly smaller quantity of reserves than at present.  A 
couple of participants noted that a facility could damp 
volatility in repo rates.  Several participants noted that a 
facility could possibly aid with multiple policy objectives.   

A number of participants noted that the policy objec-
tives for a fixed-rate standing repo facility would have 
implications for the appropriate design for the facility.  
Several participants recognized the need to carefully 
evaluate possible parameter settings to guard against un-
intended consequences, including the potential for 
moral hazard or a more volatile Federal Reserve balance 
sheet.  In addition, several participants highlighted the 
importance of evaluating whether other tools or initia-
tives could better achieve the desired goals.  Overall, no 
decisions were reached at this meeting; participants 
stated that additional work would be necessary to clearly 
define the objectives of such a facility and to evaluate its 
potential net benefits. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager pro tem discussed developments in global 
financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Trade-
related developments reportedly led many market partic-
ipants to take a more pessimistic view of the U.S. eco-
nomic outlook.  Equity prices and interest rates fell no-
ticeably after the announcement of higher tariffs on Chi-
nese imports in early May and then again after news that 
tariffs might be imposed on Mexican imports.  In re-
sponse to these developments, markets appeared to be-
come more sensitive to incoming news about the out-
look for global growth and inflation, including data that 
pointed to a continued subdued inflation environment 
and to slower economic growth in the United States and 
abroad.   

Treasury yields fell sharply and far-forward measures of 
inflation compensation dropped significantly in the 
United States and abroad.  Against this backdrop, mar-
ket participants reportedly viewed communications by 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

Federal Reserve officials as signaling a greater likelihood 
of a cut in the target range for the federal funds rate later 
in the year.  The expected path of the federal funds rate 
embedded in futures prices shifted down significantly 
over the period. 

In the euro area, far-forward measures of inflation com-
pensation fell noticeably, and market participants report-
edly increasingly came to believe that further monetary 
policy accommodation would be needed.  Late in the in-
termeeting period, remarks by European Central Bank 
(ECB) President Draghi were interpreted as suggesting 
increased odds of further asset purchases by the ECB.  
Euro-area peripheral spreads to German equivalents 
moved sharply lower, and far-forward inflation compen-
sation recovered modestly.  

The manager pro tem turned next to a review of money 
market developments and Open Market Desk opera-
tions.  Money market rates generally stabilized at mod-
estly lower levels over the intermeeting period, likely re-
flecting both the technical adjustment in the interest on 
excess reserves (IOER) rate following the May FOMC 
meeting and a sizable increase in reserve balances asso-
ciated with a decline in balances held by the Treasury in 
its account at the Federal Reserve.  Market participants 
reported seeing slightly more pass-through from repo 
rates to the federal funds rate on days with heightened 
firmness in repo rates.  Market participants attributed re-
cent increases in repo rates on month-end and mid-
month Treasury auction settlement dates in part to ele-
vated net dealer inventories of Treasury securities, which 
dealers finance in the repo market.  

Regarding open market operations over the period, 
given the substantial decline in mortgage rates over re-
cent months and an associated increase in refinancing 
activity, principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
had recently moved somewhat above the $20 billion 
monthly redemption cap.  As a result, the Desk began in 
May to reinvest agency MBS principal payments in ex-
cess of the cap.  Based on current market rates and pre-
payment forecasts, the Desk expected to reinvest mod-
est amounts of agency MBS over the coming months 
and possibly again in 2020, particularly during the sum-
mer months.  

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the June 18–19 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions remained strong.  
Real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be ris-
ing at a moderate rate in the second quarter, as house-
hold spending growth picked up from the weak first 
quarter while business fixed investment was soft.  Con-
sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per-
centage change in the price index for personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in April.  
Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-
tions were little changed. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly, on 
average, in April and May; however, job gains slowed 
sharply in May after a strong increase in April.  The un-
employment rate declined to 3.6 percent in April and re-
mained there in May, its lowest level in 50 years.  The 
labor force participation rate moved down somewhat in 
April and held steady in May, remaining close to its av-
erage over the previous few years; the employment-to-
population ratio stayed flat in April and May.  The un-
employment rates for African Americans, Asians, and 
Hispanics decreased, on net, over April and May and 
were below their levels at the end of the previous eco-
nomic expansion, though persistent differentials in un-
employment rates across groups remained.  The average 
share of workers employed part time for economic rea-
sons over April and May continued to be below the lows 
reached in late 2007.  The rate of private-sector job 
openings moved up in March and held steady in April, 
while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the 
four-week moving average of initial claims for unem-
ployment insurance benefits through early June was near 
historically low levels.  Average hourly earnings for all 
employees rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending 
in May, slightly lower than in April but somewhat faster 
than a year earlier.  Total labor compensation per hour 
in the business sector increased 1.6 percent over the four 
quarters ending in the first quarter, slower than a year 
earlier. 

Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price 
index, increased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending 
in April.  This increase was slower than a year earlier, as 
core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in 
consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 
1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained well 
below core inflation, and consumer energy price infla-
tion slowed considerably to about the same rate as core 
inflation.  The trimmed mean measure of PCE price in-
flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal-

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

las was 2.0 percent over that 12-month period.  The con-
sumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent over the 
12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 
2.0 percent.  The monthly change in core PCE prices in 
April and the staff’s estimate of the change in May—
based on the CPI data and the relevant prices from the 
producer price index—were higher in both of these 
months than the very low readings seen in January 
through March.  Recent survey-based measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on 
balance.  While measures from the Desk’s Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were lit-
tle changed, the preliminary June reading from the Uni-
versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers dropped sig-
nificantly to below its range in recent years. 

Growth in real consumer expenditures appeared to pick 
up to a solid rate in the second quarter from its weak 
first-quarter pace.  The components of the nominal retail 
sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to 
estimate PCE increased in May, and the retail sales data 
for the previous two months were revised up notably.  
Sales of light motor vehicles rose sharply in May after 
stepping down in April.  Key factors that influence con-
sumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, 
further gains in real disposable income, and still elevated 
measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of 
solid real PCE growth in the near term.  In addition, the 
Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment edged 
down in the preliminary June reading but was still at an 
upbeat level.   

Real residential investment in the second quarter looked 
to be continuing the decline seen earlier in the year, al-
beit at a slower rate.  Starts of new single-family homes 
rose in April but fell back in May, while starts of multi-
family units increased over both months.  Building per-
mit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends 
to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in con-
struction of such homes—was at roughly the same level 
in May as its first-quarter average.  Sales of new homes 
fell notably in April after a marked gain in March, and 
existing home sales edged down in April. 

Real nonresidential private fixed investment appeared 
soft in the second quarter.  Real private expenditures for 
business equipment and intellectual property looked to 
be roughly flat, as nominal shipments of nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft moved sideways in April.  
Forward-looking indicators of business equipment 
spending pointed to possible decreases in the near term.  
Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft 
declined notably in April and continued to be below the 

level of shipments, readings on business sentiment dete-
riorated further, and analysts’ expectations of firms’ 
longer-term profit growth moved down sharply.  Nom-
inal business expenditures for nonresidential structures 
outside of the drilling and mining sector decreased in 
April, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs 
in operation—an indicator of business spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued 
to decline through mid-June. 

Industrial production moved down in April and picked 
up in May, leaving output about flat over those two 
months, but production was lower than at the beginning 
of the year.  Manufacturing output declined, on net, over 
April and May, although mining output expanded.  Au-
tomakers’ assembly schedules suggested that the pro-
duction of light motor vehicles would move up in the 
near term, but new orders indexes from national and re-
gional manufacturing surveys pointed to continued soft 
total factory output in the coming months.  Moreover, 
industry news indicated that aircraft production would 
continue to be slow in the near term. 

Total real government purchases appeared to be rising 
solidly in the second quarter.  Federal government pur-
chases were being boosted by strong increases in defense 
spending through May and the return of nondefense 
purchases to more typical levels after the partial federal 
government shutdown in the first quarter.  Real pur-
chases by state and local governments seemed to be ris-
ing modestly; total payrolls of these governments edged 
down over April and May, but nominal state and local 
construction spending expanded notably in April. 

Net exports added substantially to real GDP growth in 
the first quarter, as exports increased robustly and im-
ports fell.  After widening in March, the nominal trade 
deficit narrowed in April; even though exports declined, 
imports declined by more.  The available data suggested 
that net exports would be a small drag on real GDP 
growth in the second quarter. 

Growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in 
the first quarter, as soft growth in the Canadian economy 
and weakness in several emerging market economies 
(EMEs) offset somewhat stronger growth in other ad-
vanced foreign economies (AFEs) and in China’s econ-
omy.  Recent indicators suggested that the pace of eco-
nomic activity picked up in Canada in the second quarter 
but slowed in some other AFEs.  Economic growth also 
appeared to have slowed in China.  Foreign inflation re-
mained subdued but rose a bit from lows earlier in the 
year, in part reflecting higher retail energy prices in many 
economies.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investors’ concerns about downside risks to the eco-
nomic outlook weighed on financial markets over the in-
termeeting period.  Market participants cited negative 
news about international trade tensions and, to a lesser 
extent, soft U.S. and foreign economic data as factors 
that contributed to these developments.  Nominal 
Treasury yields posted notable declines and the expected 
path of policy shifted down considerably over the pe-
riod.  Equity prices declined, on net, and corporate bond 
spreads widened.  However, financing conditions for 
businesses and households generally remained support-
ive of economic growth. 

FOMC communications following the May meeting had 
little net effect on yields, though they rose modestly fol-
lowing the Chair’s press conference.  Later in the period, 
the expected path of policy moved down, partly in re-
sponse to incoming information pointing to a weaker 
economic outlook.  The market-implied probability for 
a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal 
funds rate by the July FOMC meeting rose to about 
85 percent.  The market-implied path for the federal 
funds rate for 2019 and 2020 shifted down markedly.  
Based on overnight index swap rates, investors expected 
the federal funds rate to decline about 60 basis points by 
the end of this year—a downward revision of 40 basis 
points over the intermeeting period.   

Longer-term Treasury yields fell considerably over the 
period, with the declines driven primarily by negative 
headlines about trade tensions between the United States 
and two major trading partners, China and Mexico.  
Softer-than-expected domestic economic news, such as 
the weaker-than-expected employment data, also con-
tributed to the declines.  The spread between 10-year 
and 3-month Treasury yields fell to the bottom decile of 
its distribution since 1971.  Measures of inflation com-
pensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Se-
curities also decreased notably over the period along 
with declines in oil prices. 

Major U.S. equity price indexes declined, on net, over 
the intermeeting period.  Equity prices fell notably over 
the first few weeks of the period, primarily in response 
to the escalation of trade tensions with China and Mex-
ico.  Firms with high China exposure and those in cycli-
cal sectors—such as energy, information technology, in-
dustrials, communication services, and banks—posted 
particularly large losses.  However, later in the period, 
stock prices regained a significant portion of their losses 
amid an easing of trade tensions with Mexico and expec-
tations of a more accommodative stance of policy.  One-

month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—
the VIX—increased over the period, and corporate 
credit spreads widened. 

Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta-
ble over the intermeeting period. Overnight interest 
rates in short-term funding markets declined in response 
to the technical adjustment that reduced the IOER rate 
5 basis points to 2.35 percent after the May FOMC 
meeting.  The average of the effective federal funds rate 
over the period was about 6 basis points below the level 
just before the May FOMC meeting, well within the 
FOMC’s target range.  Rates on commercial paper and 
negotiable certificates of deposit also declined some-
what.  

Escalation of trade tensions and soft economic data also 
weighed on foreign financial markets.  Most major global 
equity price indexes declined, on net, and EME sover-
eign spreads widened modestly.  In the AFEs, policy ex-
pectations and sovereign yields declined notably, in part 
reflecting more-accommodative monetary policy com-
munications by major central banks. 

The broad dollar index rose a bit over the intermeeting 
period.  The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, which are 
viewed as safe-haven currencies, appreciated against the 
dollar.  The British pound depreciated amid increased 
uncertainty around Brexit.  Increased trade tensions con-
tributed to some depreciation of the Chinese renminbi.  
The value of the Mexican peso against the dollar fluctu-
ated in response to announcements related to potential 
tariffs on imports from Mexico but ended the period 
only slightly lower. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses contin-
ued to be accommodative overall.  Gross issuance of 
corporate bonds was strong in May following a spell of 
seasonal weakness in April.  The credit quality of nonfi-
nancial corporations remained solid, as the volume of 
nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades outpaced that of 
downgrades in May.  Issuance in the institutional syndi-
cated leveraged loan market was subdued in April but 
rebounded in May, reflecting strong issuance beyond 
that associated with refinancing of maturing leveraged 
loans.  Meanwhile, commercial and industrial lending 
slowed somewhat in April and May after a period of 
stronger growth in the first quarter.  Small business 
credit market conditions were little changed, and credit 
conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommo-
dative on net. 

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions continued to be generally accommodative.  

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period 
but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range. 
Issuance of agency and non-agency CMBS was solid in 
May, and CRE lending by banks expanded in April and 
May at a slower rate than in the first quarter. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
also remained supportive over the intermeeting period.  
Home mortgage rates decreased about 40 basis points.  
Since last November, mortgage rates had declined more 
than 1 percentage point, contributing to an increase in 
home-purchase mortgage originations to the solid levels 
seen in 2017.  

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were 
little changed in recent months and remained generally 
supportive of household spending, although the supply 
of credit to consumers with subprime credit scores con-
tinued to be tight.  Consumer credit expanded at a mod-
erate pace in the first quarter, with bank credit data 
pointing to a pickup in April and May.  Conditions in the 
consumer asset-backed securities market remained sta-
ble over the intermeeting period, with robust issuance 
and spreads that were little changed at low levels.  

Staff Economic Outlook 
The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by 
the staff for the June FOMC meeting was revised down 
somewhat on balance.  Real GDP growth was forecast 
to slow to a moderate rate in the second quarter and 
move down to a more modest pace in the second half of 
the year, primarily reflecting a more downbeat near-term 
outlook for business fixed investment.  The projection 
for real GDP growth over the medium term was little 
changed, as the effects of a higher projected path for the 
broad real dollar and lower trajectory for foreign eco-
nomic growth were largely counterbalanced by a lower 
projected path for interest rates.  Real GDP was forecast 
to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of 
potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow 
to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021.  
The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat 
through 2021 and remain below the staff’s estimate of 
its longer-run natural rate.  With labor market conditions 
judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that 

                                                           
5 In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the 
Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents 
submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run, 
based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path 

projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-
than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment 
rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the la-
bor force participation rate. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed on 
balance.  The forecast for total PCE price inflation this 
year was revised down somewhat, reflecting a lower 
near-term projection for energy prices.  The core infla-
tion forecast for this year was unchanged at a level below 
2 percent.  Both total and core inflation were projected 
to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early 
this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless 
to continue to run below 2 percent.  

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as generally similar to the average of the past 
20 years, although uncertainty was seen to have in-
creased since the previous forecast.  Moreover, the staff 
also judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP 
growth had tilted to the downside, with a skew to the 
upside for the unemployment rate.  The increased un-
certainty and shift to downside risks around the projec-
tion reflected the staff’s assessment that international 
trade tensions and foreign economic developments 
seemed more likely to move in directions that could have 
significant negative effects on the U.S. economy than to 
resolve more favorably than assumed.  With the risks to 
the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, 
the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as 
having a downward skew. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
Participants judged that uncertainties and downside risks 
surrounding the economic outlook had increased signif-
icantly over recent weeks.  While they continued to view 
a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely out-
comes, many participants attached significant odds to 
scenarios with less favorable outcomes.5  Moreover, 
nearly all participants in their submissions to the Sum-
mary of Economic Projections (SEP), had revised down 
their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal 

for the federal funds rate.  The longer-run projections repre-
sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each 
variable would be expected to converge, over time, under ap-
propriate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy assess-
ments are described in the Summary of Economic Projec-
tions, which is an addendum to these minutes.

funds rate over the projection period that would be con-
sistent with their modal economic outlook.  Many par-
ticipants noted that, since the Committee’s previous 
meeting, the economy appeared to have lost some mo-
mentum and pointed to a number of factors supporting 
that view including recent weak indicators for business 
confidence, business spending and manufacturing activ-
ity; trade developments; and signs of slowing global eco-
nomic growth.  Many participants noted that they 
viewed the risks to their growth and inflation projec-
tions, such as those emanating from greater uncertainty 
about trade, as shifting notably over recent weeks and 
that risks were now weighted to the downside. 

Participants discussed at some length the softness in var-
ious indicators of business fixed investment in the sec-
ond quarter.  Incoming data on shipments and orders of 
new capital goods looked weak and recent readings from 
some manufacturing surveys had dropped sharply.  Pri-
vate sector analysts had marked down their forecasts for 
longer-term corporate profit growth.  Manufacturing 
production had posted declines so far this year.  In addi-
tion, contacts reported that softer export sales, weaker 
economic activity abroad, and elevated levels of uncer-
tainty regarding the global outlook were weighing on 
business sentiment and leading firms to reassess plans 
for investment spending.  Several participants noted 
comments from business contacts reporting that their 
base case now assumed that uncertainties about the 
global outlook would remain prominent over the me-
dium term and would continue to act as a drag on in-
vestment.  Several participants also noted reports from 
some business contacts in the manufacturing sector sug-
gesting that they were putting capital expenditures or hir-
ing plans on hold and were reevaluating their global sup-
ply chains in light of trade uncertainties.  A couple of 
participants, however, pointed to signs that investment 
might pick up, including reports from some contacts 
that their orders and shipments remained strong and that 
some contacts planned to hire more workers.  A few par-
ticipants also noted ongoing challenges in the agricul-
tural sector, including those associated with increased 
trade uncertainty, weak export markets, wet weather, and 
severe flooding.  A few participants remarked on the de-
cline in energy prices and the associated reduction in ac-
tivity in the energy sector.  

In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
noted that available data on consumer spending had 
been solid, supported by a strong labor market and rising 
incomes.  Several participants also noted that measures 
of consumer sentiment remained upbeat, and a couple 
noted that their business contacts confirmed the view 

that consumer spending had rebounded from the weak 
patch earlier in the year.  Several participants, however, 
noted that tariffs could eventually become a drag on 
consumer durables spending, especially if additional tar-
iffs on consumer goods were imposed, and that they 
would be monitoring incoming data for signs of this ef-
fect.  A couple of participants noted that the continued 
softness in the housing sector was a concern, even 
though the decline in mortgage rates since last fall was 
expected to provide stronger impetus for activity; a cou-
ple of participants were somewhat optimistic that resi-
dential investment would pick up. 

In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited 
evidence that conditions remained strong, including the 
very low unemployment rate and the fact that job gains 
had been solid, on average, in recent months.  That said, 
job gains in May were weaker than expected and, in light 
of other developments, participants judged that it would 
be important to closely monitor incoming data for any 
signs of softening in labor market conditions.  Reports 
from business contacts pointed to continued strong la-
bor demand, with many firms planning to hire more 
workers.  Economy-wide wage growth was seen as being 
broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor 
productivity growth in recent years.  However, a few par-
ticipants noted that there were limited signs of upward 
pressure on wage inflation.  A few participants cited the 
combination of muted inflation pressures, moderate 
wage growth, and expanding employment as a possible 
indication that some slack remained in the labor market.  
Partly reflecting that combination of developments, sev-
eral participants had revised down their SEP estimates 
of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. 

Participants noted that readings on overall inflation and 
inflation for items other than food and energy had come 
in lower than expected over recent months.  In light of 
recent softer inflation readings, perceptions of downside 
risks to growth, and global disinflationary pressures, 
many participants viewed the risks to the outlook for in-
flation as weighted to the downside.  Several participants 
indicated that, while headline inflation had been close to 
2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that inflation had 
softened this year despite continued strong labor market 
conditions.  Participants generally noted that they re-
vised down their SEP projections of inflation for the 
current year in light of recent data.  They still anticipated 
that the overall rate of inflation would firm somewhat 
and move up to the Committee’s longer-run symmetric 
objective of 2 percent over the next few years. Con-
sistent with that view, several participants commented 
that alternative measures of inflation that removed the

influence of unusually large changes in the prices of in-
dividual items in either direction were running around 
2 percent. However, a number of participants antici-
pated that the return to 2 percent would take longer than 
previously projected even with an assumed path for the 
federal funds rate that was lower than in their previous 
projections.   

In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta-
tions, participants generally observed that market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had declined and 
were at low levels.  Some participants also noted that re-
cent readings on some survey measures of consumers’ 
inflation expectations had declined or stood at histori-
cally low levels.  Many participants further noted that 
longer-term inflation expectations could be somewhat 
below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective, or that the continued weakness in in-
flation could prompt expectations to slip further.  These 
developments might make it more difficult to achieve 
their inflation objective on a sustained basis.  However, 
several participants remarked that inflation expectations 
appeared to be at levels consistent with the Committee’s 
2 percent inflation objective.   

Participants generally agreed that downside risks to the 
outlook for economic activity had risen materially since 
their May meeting, particularly those associated with on-
going trade negotiations and slowing economic growth 
abroad.  Other downside risks cited by several partici-
pants included the possibility that federal budget negoti-
ations could result in a sharp reduction in government 
spending or that negotiations to raise the federal debt 
limit could be prolonged.  A couple of participants ob-
served that an economic deterioration in the United 
States, if it occurred, might be amplified by significant 
debt burdens for many firms.  A few participants re-
marked that an upside risk to the outlook for economic 
activity and inflation included a scenario in which trade 
negotiations were resolved favorably and business senti-
ment rebounded sharply.   

In their discussion of financial developments, partici-
pants observed that the increase in uncertainty sur-
rounding the global outlook had affected risk sentiment 
in financial markets.  While overall financial conditions 
remained supportive of growth, those conditions ap-
peared to be premised importantly on expectations that 
the Federal Reserve would ease policy in the near term 
to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming 
from uncertainties about the global outlook and other 
downside risks.  Participants also discussed the decline 
in yields on longer-term Treasury securities in recent 

months.  Many participants noted that the spread be-
tween the 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields was now 
negative, and several noted that their assessment of the 
risk of a slowing in the economic expansion had in-
creased based on either the shape of the yield curve or 
other financial and economic indicators.  A few partici-
pants pointed to the growth in debt issuance by nonfi-
nancial corporations and still generally high asset valua-
tions as developments that warranted continued moni-
toring. 

In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this 
meeting, participants noted that, under their baseline 
outlook, the labor market was likely to remain strong 
with economic activity growing at a moderate pace.  
However, they judged that the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding their outlooks, particularly those related to 
the global economic outlook, had intensified in recent 
weeks.  Moreover, inflation continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective; similarly, inflation for 
items other than food and energy had remained below 
2 percent as well.  In addition, some readings on infla-
tion expectations had been low.  The increase in risks 
and uncertainties surrounding the outlook was quite re-
cent and nearly all participants agreed that it would be 
appropriate to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent at this meeting.  
However, they noted that it would be important to mon-
itor the implications of incoming information and global 
economic developments for the U.S. economic outlook.  
A couple of participants favored a cut in the target range 
at this meeting, judging that a prolonged period with in-
flation running below 2 percent warranted a more ac-
commodative policy response to firmly center inflation 
and inflation expectations around the Committee’s sym-
metric 2 percent objective.   

With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting, nearly all participants had revised down 
their assessment of the appropriate path for the federal 
funds rate over the projection period in their SEP sub-
missions, and some had marked down their estimates of 
the longer-run normal level of the funds rate as well.  
Many participants indicated that the case for somewhat 
more accommodative policy had strengthened.  Partici-
pants widely noted that the global developments that led 
to the heightened uncertainties about the economic out-
look were quite recent.  Many judged additional mone-
tary policy accommodation would be warranted in the 
near term should these recent developments prove to be 
sustained and continue to weigh on the economic out-
look.  Several others noted that additional monetary pol-

icy accommodation could well be appropriate if incom-
ing information showed further deterioration in the out-
look.  Participants stated a variety of reasons that would 
call for a lower path of the federal funds rate.  Several 
participants noted that a near-term cut in the target range 
for the federal funds rate could help cushion the effects 
of possible future adverse shocks to the economy and, 
hence, was appropriate policy from a risk-management 
perspective.  Some participants also noted that the con-
tinued shortfall in inflation risked a softening of inflation 
expectations that could slow the sustained return of in-
flation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Several 
participants pointed out that they had revised down their 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-
ment and, as a result, saw a smaller upward contribution 
to inflation pressures from tight resource utilization than 
they had earlier.  A few participants were concerned that 
inflation expectations had already moved below levels 
consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective and that it was important to provide additional 
accommodation in the near term to bolster inflation ex-
pectations.  A few participants judged that allowing in-
flation to run above 2 percent for some time could help 
strengthen the credibility of the Committee’s commit-
ment to its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. 

Some participants suggested that although they now 
judged that the appropriate path of the federal funds rate 
would follow a flatter trajectory than they had previously 
assumed, there was not yet a strong case for a rate cut 
from current levels.  They preferred to gather more in-
formation on the trajectory of the economy before con-
cluding that a change in policy stance is warranted.  A 
few participants expressed the view that with the econ-
omy still in a favorable position in terms of the dual 
mandate, an easing of policy in an attempt to increase 
inflation a few tenths of a percentage point risked over-
heating the labor markets and fueling financial imbal-
ances.  Several participants observed that the trimmed 
mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 per-
cent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low 
readings on inflation will prove transitory.  

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members noted the significant increase in risks 
and uncertainties attending the economic outlook.  
There were signs of weakness in U.S. business spending, 
and foreign economic data were generally disappointing, 
raising concerns about the strength of global economic 
growth.  While strong labor markets and rising incomes 

continued to support the outlook for consumer spend-
ing, uncertainties and risks regarding the global outlook 
appeared to be contributing to a deterioration in risk 
sentiment in financial markets and a decline in business 
confidence that pointed to a weaker outlook for business 
investment in the United States.  Inflation pressures re-
mained muted and some readings on inflation expecta-
tions were at low levels.  Although nearly all members 
agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds 
rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent at this meeting, they generally 
agreed that risks and uncertainties surrounding the eco-
nomic outlook had intensified and many judged that ad-
ditional policy accommodation would be warranted if 
they continued to weigh on the economic outlook.  One 
member preferred to lower the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting, stating 
that the Committee should ease policy at this meeting to 
re-center inflation and inflation expectations at the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.  

Members agreed that in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objectives.  They reiterated that this assessment 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments.  
More generally, members noted that decisions regarding 
near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy 
would appropriately remain dependent on the implica-
tions of incoming information for the economic out-
look. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to several adjustments in the description of the 
economic situation, including a revision in the descrip-
tion of market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion to recognize the recent fall in inflation compensa-
tion.  The Committee retained the characterization of 
the most likely outcomes as “sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective” but added a clause to emphasize that uncertain-
ties about this outlook had increased.  In describing the 
monetary policy outlook, members agreed to remove the 
“patient” language and to emphasize instead that, in light 
of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the 
Committee would closely monitor the implications of in-
coming information for the economic outlook and 
would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 
2 percent objective.   

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the System Open Market Account in ac-
cordance with the following domestic policy directive, to 
be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective June 20, 2019, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re-
verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-
chase operations with maturities of more than 
one day when necessary to accommodate week-
end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at 
an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim-
ited only by the value of Treasury securities held 
outright in the System Open Market Account 
that are available for such operations and by a 
per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during each cal-
endar month that exceeds $15 billion, and to 
continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-
backed securities the amount of principal pay-
ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities received during each calendar month that 
exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from 
these amounts for operational reasons are ac-
ceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in May indicates that 
the labor market remains strong and that eco-
nomic activity is rising at a moderate rate.  Job 
gains have been solid, on average, in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate has re-
mained low.  Although growth of household 

spending appears to have picked up from earlier 
in the year, indicators of business fixed invest-
ment have been soft.  On a 12-month basis, 
overall inflation and inflation for items other 
than food and energy are running below 2 per-
cent.  Market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation have declined; survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  In support of these goals, 
the Committee decided to maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 
2½ percent.  The Committee continues to view 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes, but uncer-
tainties about this outlook have increased.  In 
light of these uncertainties and muted inflation 
pressures, the Committee will closely monitor 
the implications of incoming information for 
the economic outlook and will act as appropri-
ate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor 
market and inflation near its symmetric 2 per-
cent objective. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal 
K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren. 

Voting against this action:  James Bullard. 

Mr. Bullard dissented because he believed that the cur-
rent stance of monetary policy could be better posi-
tioned to foster progress toward the Committee’s statu-
tory objectives of maximum employment and stable 
prices.  Particularly in light of persistent low readings on 
inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations

along with the risks to the U.S. outlook associated with 
global economic developments, he noted that a policy 
rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-cen-
ter inflation and inflation expectations at levels con-
sistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objective and simultaneously provide some insur-
ance against unexpected developments that could slow 
U.S. economic growth. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-
changed at 2.35 percent and voted unanimously to ap-
prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex-
isting level of 3.00 percent, effective June 20, 2019. 

Update from Subcommittee on Communications 
Governor Clarida provided a brief update on the work 
of the subcommittee on communications.  The Fed Lis-
tens conferences conducted to date were viewed as suc-
cessful in identifying many important issues for the stra-

tegic review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and com-
munications.  Additional Fed Listens events were 
planned over the remainder of the year.  The Committee 
was likely to begin internal deliberations on aspects of 
the strategic review over coming FOMC meetings. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 30–31, 
2019.  The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on June 19, 
2019. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on May 21, 2019, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on April 30–May 1, 2019.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 18–19, 2019, meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each 
year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run.  Each 
participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-
isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability. 

Participants who submitted longer-run projections gen-
erally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat 
above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate.  
Thereafter, almost all participants expected real GDP 
growth to edge down, with the vast majority of partici-
pants projecting growth in 2021 to be at or below their 
estimates of its longer-run rate.  All participants who 
submitted longer-run projections continued to expect 
that the unemployment rate would run at or below their 
estimates of its longer-run level through 2021.  Com-
pared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) 
from March 2019, most participants revised down 
slightly their projections for the unemployment rate 
from 2019 through 2021.  All participants marked down 
somewhat their projections for 2019 for total inflation, 
as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the 
price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE), and almost all did so for their projections for 
core inflation.  All participants projected that inflation 
would increase in 2020, from 2019, and a majority ex-
pected another slight increase in 2021.  The vast majority 
of participants expected that inflation would be at or 

                                                           
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate. 

slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 
2021.  Core PCE price inflation was also expected to in-
crease over the projection period, rising to 2.0 percent in 
2021.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics 
for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, just over half of the participants 
expected that the evolution of the economy, relative to 
their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds 
rate at or slightly above its current level through the end 
of 2019; almost half projected that a lower level for the 
federal funds rate would be appropriate by year-end.  
The median of participants’ assessments of the appro-
priate level of the federal funds rate at the end of the 
projection period was close to the median of their as-
sessments of the longer-run federal funds rate level.  
Nearly all participants lowered their projections for the 
appropriate level of the federal funds rate, relative to 
March, at some point in the forecast period.  The medi-
ans for the federal funds rate for 2020 and 2021 were 
50 basis points and 25 basis points lower than in March, 
respectively.  The median of projections for the long-run 
normal level of the federal funds rate was 25 basis points 
lower than in the March projections. 

Most participants regarded the uncertainties around 
their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core 
inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  About half of the participants viewed the level 
of uncertainty around their unemployment rate projec-
tions as being similar to the average of the past 20 years, 
and about the same number viewed uncertainty as 
higher.  Participants’ assessments of risks to their out-
looks for output growth and the unemployment rate 
shifted notably relative to their assessments in March.  
As a result, most participants viewed the risks for GDP 
growth as weighted to the downside and for the unem-
ployment rate as weighted to the upside.  About half of 
participants viewed the risks to inflation as being broadly 
balanced, with a similar number viewing inflation risks 
as being weighted to the downside.

The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemploy-
ment 
As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projec-
tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi-
tional on their individual assessments of appropriate 
monetary policy, was 2.1 percent, a bit above the median 
estimate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent.  Almost all 
participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow 
over the projection period, with the median projection 
at 2.0 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021.  Rela-
tive to the March SEP, the medians of the projections 
for real GDP growth in 2019, 2020, 2021, and the longer 
run were little changed.  

The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.6 percent, about ½ per-
centage point below the median assessment of its longer-
run level of 4.2 percent.  The medians of projections for 
2020 and 2021 were 3.7 percent and 3.8 percent, respec-
tively.  These median unemployment rates, along with 
the median for the unemployment rate in the longer run, 
were a little lower than those from the March SEP.  As 
was the case in March, almost all participants who sub-
mitted longer-run projections expected that the unem-
ployment rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of 
its longer-run level. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP 
growth for 2019 through 2021 all shifted up modestly 
relative to that in the March SEP.  The distribution for 
the longer-run growth rate was little changed.  The dis-
tributions of individual projections for the unemploy-
ment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved lower relative to 
those in March, and the distribution in 2021 edged down 
as well.  Meanwhile, the distribution for the longer-run 
unemployment rate shifted down a touch. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
As shown in table 1, the median of projections for total 
PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2019, notably 
lower than in the March SEP, while the median for 2020, 
at 1.9 percent, was a touch lower than in March.  The 
median for total inflation for 2021 was unchanged from 
March at 2.0 percent.  The medians of projections for 
core PCE price inflation for 2019 and 2020 were 1.8 per-
cent and 1.9 percent, respectively, both a little lower rel-
ative to the March SEP.  The median for 2021 was 
2.0 percent, unchanged from the March SEP. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of projections for total PCE 
price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019 
shifted down notably from the March SEP, while those 
for 2020 and 2021 changed more modestly.  Beyond the 
current year, for which projections also reflect data in 
hand, almost all participants expected total and core 
PCE price inflation to be between 1.9 and 2.2 percent. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of 
each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run.  
On the whole, the distributions for 2019 through 2021 
shifted toward lower values.  Almost all participants 
viewed the appropriate levels of the federal funds rate at 
the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 as lower than those that 
they deemed appropriate in March.  Nearly all partici-
pants lowered their projections for the appropriate level 
of the federal funds rate, relative to March, at some point 
in the projection period, and none raised their projec-
tions for the federal funds rate for any year.  Compared 
with the projections prepared for the March SEP, the 
median federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower in 
2020, 25 basis points lower in 2021, and 25 basis points 
lower in the longer-run.  While the median of federal 
funds rate projections at the end of 2019 remained at 
2.38 percent, almost half of participants projected an ap-
propriate level of the target range for the federal funds 
rate at the end of 2019 that was 25 basis points or 50 ba-
sis points lower than at present.  In subsequent years, the 
medians of the projections were 2.13 percent at the end 
of 2020 and 2.38 percent at the end of 2021, slightly 
lower than the median of the longer-run projections of 
the federal funds rate of 2.50 percent.  Muted inflation 
pressures and concerns about declining inflation expec-
tations, trade developments, and foreign economic 
growth, as well as weaker business fixed investment, 
were cited as factors contributing to the downward revi-
sions in participants’ assessments of the appropriate 
path for the policy rate.    

Uncertainty and Risks 
In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of 
possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those 
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government forecasts over the past 
20  years—for  real  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root 

mean squared error of projections for 1999 through 2018 that were re-
leased in the summer by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His-
torical Forecasting Errors:  The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance 
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth 
quarter basis.

rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the

rate, and total PCE price inflation.  Those measures are 
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the 
top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts 
display the SEP medians for the three variables sur-
rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived 
from the forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the de-
gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar 
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the 
risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then 
future outcomes of these variables would have about a 
70 percent probability of being within these confidence 
intervals.  For all three variables, this measure of uncer-
tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore-
cast horizon lengthens. 

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  The vast majority of participants continued to view 
the uncertainty around their projections for inflation as 
broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years; most 
also viewed uncertainty around their projections for 
GDP growth as similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  Views on uncertainty around unemployment 
                                                           
2 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur-
rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach 

rate projections were roughly evenly distributed between 
those who saw similar levels of uncertainty relative to the 
historical average and those who saw higher uncer-
tainty.2 

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their current economic 
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The balance of risks to the pro-
jection for real GDP growth shifted lower, with 14 par-
ticipants assessing the risks as weighted to the downside, 
3 assessing them to be broadly balanced, and no partici-
pant seeing them as weighted to the upside.  Similarly, 
the balance of risks to the projection for the unemploy-
ment rate moved higher, with 12 participants judging the 
risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside 
and 5 participants viewing the risks as broadly balanced.  
In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation projec-
tions shifted down relative to March.  Six more partici-
pants than in March saw the risks to the inflation projec-
tions as weighted to the downside, and no participant 
judged the risks as weighted to the upside. 

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, trade developments, concerns 
about global economic growth, and weaker business 
fixed investment were mentioned by participants as 
sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. eco-
nomic growth outlook.  For the inflation outlook, the 
effect of trade developments was cited as a source of up-
side risk, while the possibility that inflation expectations 
could be drifting below levels consistent with the 
FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or the potential 
for a stronger dollar or weaker domestic demand to put 
downward pressure on inflation were viewed as down-
side risks.  A number of participants mentioned that 
their assessments of risks remained roughly balanced in 
part because the downward revisions to their appropri-
ate path for the federal funds rate were offsetting factors 
that would otherwise contribute to asymmetric risks. 

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal 
funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-
opments over time in key economic variables such as 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, 

used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici-
pants’ projections.

uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed-
eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties 
about the paths for these economic variables along with 
other factors.  Figure 5 provides a graphical representa-
tion of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for the 
federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals 
derived from the results presented in table 2.  As with 
the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty 
surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 
4.8 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the 
third year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence inter-
vals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the 
current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third 
years.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence 
bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on 
the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  However, in 
some instances, the risks around the projections may not be 
symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be 
negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projec-
tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in 
which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet-
rically positioned around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
