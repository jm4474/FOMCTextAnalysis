Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and 
Communication Practices 
Committee participants continued their discussions re-
lated to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s 
monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication 
practices.  Staff briefings provided an assessment of the 
risk that the federal funds rate could, in some future 
downturn, be constrained by the effective lower bound 
(ELB) and discussed options for mitigating the costs as-
sociated with this constraint.  The staff’s analysis sug-
gested that the ELB would likely bind in most future re-
cessions, which could make it more difficult for the 
FOMC to achieve its longer-run objectives of maximum 
employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation.  The 
staff discussed several options for mitigating ELB risks, 
including using forward guidance and balance sheet pol-
icies earlier and more aggressively than in the past.  

6 Attended the discussion of the review of the monetary policy 
framework through the end of the meeting. 
7 Attended opening remarks for Tuesday session only.

The staff also illustrated the properties of “makeup” 
strategies using model simulations.  Under such strate-
gies, policymakers would promise to make up for past 
inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative 
stance of policy that is intended to generate higher future 
inflation.  These strategies are designed to provide ac-
commodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate low 
for an extended period in order to support an economic 
recovery.  Because of their properties both at and away 
from the ELB, makeup strategies may also more firmly 
anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent than a policy 
strategy that does not compensate for past inflation 
misses.  The staff analysis emphasized, however, that the 
benefits of makeup strategies depend importantly on the 
private sector’s understanding of these strategies and 
their confidence that future policymakers would follow 
through on promises to keep policy accommodative. 

Participants generally agreed with the staff’s analysis that 
the risk of future ELB episodes had likely increased over 
time, and that future ELB episodes and the reduced ef-
fect of resource utilization on inflation could inhibit the 
Committee’s ability to achieve its employment and infla-
tion objectives.  The increased ELB risk was attributed 
in part to structural changes in the U.S. economy that 
had lowered the longer-run real short-term interest rate 
and thus the neutral level of the policy rate.  In this con-
text, a couple of participants noted that uncertainty 
about the neutral rate made it especially challenging to 
determine any appropriate changes to the current frame-
work.  In light of a low neutral rate and shortfalls of in-
flation below the 2 percent objective for several years, 
some participants raised the concern that the policy 
space to reduce the federal funds rate in response to fu-
ture recessions could be compressed further if inflation 
shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation ex-
pectations, a risk that was also discussed in the staff anal-
ysis.  These participants pointed to long, ongoing ELB 
spells in other major foreign economies and suggested 
that, to avoid similar circumstances in the United States, 
it was important to be aggressive when confronted with 
forces holding inflation below objective.  A couple of 
participants judged that the lack of monetary policy 
space abroad and the possibility that fiscal space in the 
United States might be limited reinforced the case for 
strengthening the FOMC’s monetary policy framework 
as a matter of prudent planning. 

With regard to the current monetary policy framework, 
participants agreed that this framework served the Com-
mittee well in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  A 
number of participants noted that the Committee’s ex-

perience with forward guidance and balance sheet poli-
cies would likely allow the Committee to deploy these 
tools earlier and more aggressively in the event that they 
were needed.  A few indicated that the uncertainty about 
the effectiveness of these policies was smaller than the 
uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of a makeup 
strategy. 

Participants generally agreed that the current framework 
also served the Committee well by providing a strong 
commitment to achieving the Committee’s maximum-
employment and symmetric inflation objectives.  Such a 
commitment was seen as flexible enough to allow the 
Committee to choose policy actions that best support its 
objectives in a wide array of economic circumstances.  
Because of the downside risk to inflation and employ-
ment associated with the ELB, most participants were 
open to the possibility that the dual-mandate objectives 
of maximum employment and stable prices could be 
best served by strategies that deliver inflation rates that 
over time are, on average, equal to the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent.  Promoting such out-
comes may require aiming for inflation somewhat above 
2 percent when the policy rate was away from the ELB, 
recognizing that inflation would tend to be lower than 
2 percent when the policy rate was constrained by the 
ELB.  Participants suggested several alternatives for do-
ing so, including strategies that make up for past infla-
tion shortfalls and those that respond more aggressively 
to below-target inflation than to above-target inflation.  
In this context, several participants suggested that the 
adoption of a target range for inflation could be helpful 
in achieving the Committee’s objective of 2 percent in-
flation, on average, as it could help communicate to the 
public that periods in which the Committee judged in-
flation to be moderately away from its 2 percent objec-
tive were appropriate.  A couple of participants sug-
gested analyzing policies in which there was a target 
range for inflation whose midpoint was modestly higher 
than 2 percent or in which 2 percent was an inflation 
floor; these policies might enhance policymakers’ scope 
to provide accommodation as appropriate when the 
neutral real interest rate was low. 

Although ensuring inflation outcomes averaging 2 per-
cent over time was seen as important, many participants 
noted that the illustrated makeup strategies delivered 
only modest benefits in the staff’s model simulations.  
These modest benefits in part reflected that the respon-
siveness of inflation to resource slack had diminished, 
making it more difficult to provide sufficient accommo-
dation to push inflation back to the Committee’s objec-
tive in a timely manner.  Some participants suggested

that the modest effects were particularly pronounced us-
ing the FRB/US model and indicated the need for more 
robustness analysis of simulation results along several di-
mensions and for further comparison to other alterna-
tive strategies.  In addition, several participants noted 
that the implementation of the makeup strategies in the 
form of either average inflation targeting or price-level 
targeting in the simulations was tied too rigidly to the 
details of particular rules.  An advantage of the current 
framework over such alternative approaches is that it has 
provided the Committee with the flexibility to assess a 
broad range of factors and information in choosing its 
policy actions, and these actions can vary depending on 
economic circumstances in order to best achieve the 
Committee’s dual mandate.  Similarly, makeup strategies 
could be implemented more flexibly in order to deliver 
more accommodation during a future downturn and 
through the subsequent recovery than what could be 
achieved with a mechanical makeup rule.   

Participants also discussed a number of challenges asso-
ciated with makeup strategies.  Many participants ex-
pressed reservations with the makeup strategies analyzed 
by the staff.  Some participants raised the concern that 
the effective use of the makeup strategies in the form of 
the average inflation targeting and price-level targeting 
rules that the staff presented depended on future policy-
makers following through on commitments to keep pol-
icy accommodative for a long time.  Such commitments 
might be difficult for future policymakers to follow 
through on, especially in situations in which the labor 
market was strong and inflation was above target.  A few 
participants acknowledged that credibly committing to 
makeup strategies posed challenges.  However, they 
pointed to the commitments that central banks around 
the world made to inflation targeting as examples in 
which similar challenges had been overcome.  A couple 
of participants raised the concern that keeping policy 
rates low for a long time could lead to excessive risk-
taking in financial markets and threaten financial stabil-
ity.  However, a couple of other participants judged that 
macroprudential tools could be used to help ensure that 
any overleveraging of households and firms did not 
threaten the financial system, while monetary policy 
needed to be focused on achieving maximum employ-
ment and symmetric 2 percent inflation.  A few partici-
pants viewed the communication challenges associated 
with average-inflation targeting strategies, including the 
difficulty of conveying the dangers of low inflation to 
the public, as greater than for some other strategies that 
use threshold-based forward guidance.  Several partici-
pants noted that makeup strategies could unduly limit 

the policy response in situations in which inflation had 
been running above 2 percent amid signs of an impend-
ing economic downturn.  Accordingly, these participants 
favored makeup strategies that only reversed past infla-
tion shortfalls relative to makeup strategies that reversed 
both past inflation shortfalls and past overruns. 

Participants continued to discuss the benefits of the 
Committee’s review of the monetary policy framework 
as well as the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run 
Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates 
the Committee’s approach to monetary policy.  As they 
did at their meeting in July, participants mentioned sev-
eral issues that this statement might possibly address.  
These issues included the conduct of monetary policy in 
the presence of the ELB constraint, the role of inflation 
expectations in the Committee’s pursuit of its inflation 
goal, the best means of conveying the Committee’s bal-
anced approach to monetary policy, the symmetry of its 
inflation goal, and the time frame over which the Com-
mittee aimed to achieve it.  Participants expected that 
they would continue their deliberations on these and 
other topics pertinent to the review at upcoming meet-
ings.  They also generally agreed that the Committee’s 
consideration of possible modifications to its policy 
strategy, tools, and communication practices would take 
some time, and that the process would be careful, delib-
erate, and patient.   

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations  
The manager pro tem first discussed developments in 
global financial markets over the intermeeting period.  
Global financial markets were volatile over the inter-
meeting period, with market participants reacting to in-
coming information about U.S.–China trade tensions 
and the global growth outlook.  In the weeks following 
the July FOMC meeting, U.S. yields declined sharply and 
risk asset prices fell amid a spate of largely negative news 
about risks to the global economic outlook.  These price 
moves reversed to some degree in September as devel-
opments on trade and economic data turned more posi-
tive.  On net, Treasury yields remained substantially 
lower, while the S&P 500 and corporate credit spreads 
reversed most or all of their earlier losses to end the pe-
riod little changed.   

Even after the partial rebound in September, market- 
and survey-based indicators of policy rate expectations 
suggested that investors viewed it as very likely that the 
Committee would ease policy further at this meeting.  All 
respondents from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers 
and Survey of Market Participants viewed a 25 basis 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

point decrease in the target range as the most likely out-
come at this meeting.  Looking beyond September, most 
survey respondents expected another 25 basis point cut 
by year-end.  Further out, while the median of respond-
ents’ modal forecasts for the end of 2020 pointed to no 
rate cuts next year, individual forecasts were much more 
dispersed, with nearly half of respondents expecting at 
least one additional 25 basis point cut in 2020, and about 
one-fourth expecting two or more cuts.  Market partici-
pants remained attentive to a range of global risk factors 
that could affect the policy rate path, including trade ten-
sions between the United States and China, develop-
ments in Europe, political tensions in Hong Kong, un-
certainties related to Brexit, and escalating geopolitical 
tension in the Middle East following attacks on Saudi oil 
facilities. 

The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of 
money market conditions.  Money markets were stable 
over most of the period, and the reduction in the interest 
on excess reserves (IOER) rate following the July 
FOMC meeting fully passed through to money market 
rates.  However, money markets became highly volatile 
just before the September meeting, apparently spurred 
partly by large corporate tax payments and Treasury set-
tlements, and remained so through the time of the meet-
ing.  In an environment of greater perceived uncertainty 
about potential outflows related to the corporate tax 
payment date, typical lenders in money markets were less 
willing to accommodate increased dealer demand for 
funding.  Moreover, some banks maintained reserve lev-
els significantly above those reported in the Senior Fi-
nancial Officer Survey about their lowest comfortable 
level of reserves rather than lend in repo markets.  
Money market mutual funds reportedly also held back 
some liquidity in order to cushion against potential out-
flows.  Rates on overnight Treasury repurchase agree-
ments rose to over 5 percent on September 16 and above 
8 percent on September 17. 

Highly elevated repo rates passed through to rates in un-
secured markets.  Federal Home Loan Banks reportedly 
scaled back their lending in the federal funds market in 
order to maintain some liquidity in anticipation of higher 
demand for advances from their members and to shift 
more of their overnight funding into repo.  In this envi-
ronment, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) rose to 
the top of the target range on September 16.  The fol-
lowing morning, in accordance with the FOMC’s di-
rective to the Desk to foster conditions to maintain the 
EFFR in the target range, the Desk conducted overnight 
repurchase operations for up to $75 billion.  After the 

operation, rates in secured and unsecured markets de-
clined sharply.  Rates in secured markets were trading 
around 2.5 percent after the operation.  Market partici-
pants reportedly expected that additional temporary 
open market operations would be necessary both over 
subsequent days and around the end of the quarter.  
Many also reportedly expected another 5 basis point 
technical adjustment of the IOER rate.   

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation  
The information available for the September 17–18 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained 
strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) ap-
peared to be increasing at a moderate rate in the third 
quarter.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 
12-month percentage change in the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 
2 percent in July.  Survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations were little changed. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid 
pace in July and August, although at a slower rate than 
in the first half of the year.  (Separately, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics’ preliminary estimate of the upcoming 
benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will 
be incorporated in the published data in February 2020, 
indicated that the revised pace of average monthly job 
gains from April 2018 to March 2019 would be notably 
slower than in the current published data.)  The unem-
ployment rate remained at 3.7 percent through August, 
and both the labor force participation rate and the em-
ployment-to-population ratio moved up.  The unem-
ployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics de-
clined over July and August, while the rates for whites 
and Asians increased; the unemployment rate for each 
group was below its level at the end of the previous eco-
nomic expansion, though persistent differentials be-
tween these rates remained.  The average share of work-
ers employed part time for economic reasons in July and 
August continued to be below its level in late 2007.  Both 
the rate of private-sector job openings and the rate of 
quits moved roughly sideways in June and July and were 
still at relatively high levels; the four-week moving aver-
age of initial claims for unemployment insurance bene-
fits through early September was near historically low 
levels.  Total labor compensation per hour in the busi-
ness sector increased 4.4 percent over the four quarters

ending in the second quarter, a faster rate than a year 
earlier.  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 
3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, the 
same pace as a year earlier.   

Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price 
index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending 
in July.  This increase was slower than a year earlier, as 
core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in 
consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 
1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained be-
low core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined.  
The average monthly change in core PCE prices in re-
cent months was faster than earlier this year, suggesting 
that the soft inflation readings during the earlier period 
were transitory.  The trimmed mean measure of  
12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in 
July.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.7 percent 
over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI 
inflation was 2.4 percent.  Recent survey-based measures 
of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed 
on balance.  The preliminary September reading from 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers 
dipped after edging up in August, but it remained within 
its recent range; the measures of longer-run inflation ex-
pectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers 
and Survey of Market Participants were little changed. 

Real consumer expenditures appeared to be rising solidly 
in the third quarter after expanding strongly in the sec-
ond quarter.  Real PCE rose briskly in July, while the 
components of the nominal retail sales data used by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate PCE 
were flat in August and the rate of sales of light motor 
vehicles only edged up, suggesting some slowing in con-
sumer spending growth in the third quarter from its 
strong second-quarter pace.  Key factors that influence 
consumer spending—including a low unemployment 
rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels 
of households’ net worth, and generally low borrowing 
rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the 
near term.  The preliminary September reading on the 
Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment picked 
up a little after weakening notably in August, although 
the Conference Board survey measure of consumer con-
fidence did not show a similar decline in August. 

Real residential investment seemed to be picking up a 
little in the third quarter after declining over the previous 
year and a half.  Starts of new single-family homes were 
higher in July and August than the second-quarter aver-
age, and starts of multifamily units rose in August after 

falling back in July.  Building permit issuance for new 
single-family homes—which tends to be a good indica-
tor of the underlying trend in construction of such 
homes—was higher in July and August than its second-
quarter average.  Sales of existing homes rose modestly 
in July, while new home sales declined following an out-
sized increase in June. 

Real nonresidential private fixed investment looked to 
be declining further in the third quarter.  Nominal ship-
ments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft de-
creased in July, and forward-looking indicators generally 
pointed to continued softness in business equipment 
spending.  Orders for nondefense capital goods exclud-
ing aircraft increased in June but were still below the 
level of shipments, most measures of business sentiment 
deteriorated, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term 
profit growth declined further, and trade policy concerns 
continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions.  
Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc-
tures outside the drilling and mining sector decreased in 
July, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in 
operation—an indicator of business spending for struc-
tures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to de-
cline through mid-September. 

Industrial production increased modestly, on net, over 
July and August, but production remained notably lower 
than at the beginning of the year.  Automakers’ assembly 
schedules indicated that the production of light motor 
vehicles would be roughly flat in the near term (although 
the labor strike at General Motors was expected to tem-
porarily disrupt vehicle production), while new orders 
indexes from national and regional manufacturing sur-
veys and a persistent drag from trade tariffs pointed to-
ward continued softness in factory output in coming 
months.  

Total real government purchases appeared to be rising 
at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the second 
quarter.  Federal defense spending over July and August 
decelerated, and federal hiring of temporary workers for 
next year’s decennial census was modest in August.  
State and local government payrolls rose moderately 
over July and August, and nominal spending by these 
governments on structures in July was below its second-
quarter average.  

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit remained 
about unchanged in June before narrowing in July.  Ex-
ports, which had been soft over most of the past year, 
declined sharply in June but partially rebounded in July.  
This pattern was particularly notable in exports of non-
aircraft capital goods and consumer goods.  Imports also

declined sharply in June and then declined a little further 
in July.  Imports of oil and consumer goods fell in June, 
while imports of capital goods dropped significantly in 
July.  The BEA estimated that the change in net exports 
was a drag of about ¾ percentage point on real GDP 
growth in the second quarter. 

Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the sec-
ond quarter.  Growth picked up in Canada as oil produc-
tion rebounded, but growth slowed sharply in Europe 
amid a downturn in manufacturing activity and persis-
tent policy-related uncertainty.  Growth also slowed in 
China and India.  Recent indicators suggested wide-
spread weakness in manufacturing abroad even as ser-
vices activity appeared to be holding up relatively well.  
Foreign inflation rose in the second quarter, pushed up 
by earlier increases in oil prices as well as by rising food 
prices in some emerging economies.  However, data on 
foreign core consumer prices showed little sign of un-
derlying inflationary pressures abroad.  Late in the inter-
meeting period, an attack on a key oil facility in Saudi 
Arabia disrupted Saudi oil production and caused an in-
itial spike in prices on near-dated oil futures contracts. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation  
Financial market developments over the intermeeting 
period were driven by an escalation in international trade 
tensions, growing concerns about the global economic 
growth outlook, and the prospect of more policy accom-
modation by central banks.  Nominal Treasury yields 
posted very large declines in August as investors reacted 
to the U.S. Administration’s announcement of addi-
tional tariffs on Chinese goods, along with the deprecia-
tion of the Chinese renminbi through the perceived 
threshold of 7 renminbi per U.S. dollar and the associ-
ated implications of these actions for the global eco-
nomic outlook.  Treasury yields partially rebounded fol-
lowing better-than-expected incoming economic data in 
the United States and abroad, a perceived reduction in 
the probability of a no-deal Brexit, and some positive 
headlines about trade policy.  The market-implied path 
of the federal funds rate shifted down on net.  Broad 
equity price indexes were down as much as 6 percent in 
early August but almost fully recovered by the end of the 
intermeeting period.  Spreads on investment-grade cor-
porate bonds widened modestly, while those on specu-
lative-grade corporate bonds were little changed on net.  
Financing conditions for businesses and households 
were largely unaffected by the intermeeting turbulence 
in financial markets and remained generally supportive 
of spending and economic activity. 

Measures of expectations of the near- and medium-term 
path for the federal funds rate were particularly sensitive 
to news about U.S.–China trade tensions, while FOMC 
communications had only modest effects on market-
based measures of policy rate expectations.  A straight 
read of the option-implied probability distribution of the 
federal funds rate suggested that the odds investors at-
tached to a 25 basis point reduction in the target range 
of the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meet-
ing increased from about 50 percent at the time of the 
July FOMC meeting to 90 percent by the end of the in-
termeeting period.  Respondents to the Desk’s Survey of 
Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants as-
signed, on average, similarly high odds to a rate decrease 
at the September FOMC meeting.  In addition, market-
implied expectations for the federal funds rate at year-
end and beyond moved down.  A straight read of OIS 
(overnight index swap) forward rates suggested that in-
vestors expected the federal funds rate to decline about 
45 basis points by year-end, to a level nearly 10 basis 
points lower than was expected at the time of the July 
FOMC meeting, and to decrease an additional roughly 
45 basis points by the end of 2020. 

Nominal Treasury yields decreased, on net, over the in-
termeeting period, with longer-term yields falling the 
most.  The spread between 10-year and 3-month Treas-
ury yields became a bit more negative, while the spread 
between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields turned neg-
ative for the first time since 2007 and fluctuated around 
zero until the September FOMC meeting.  Measures of 
inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities declined on net.  

Broad stock price indexes decreased slightly, on net, 
over the intermeeting period amid heightened volatility.  
The escalation of trade tensions between China and the 
United States weighed on equity prices, but investors’ 
expectations that major central banks would shift toward 
more accommodative monetary policies provided some 
support.  Equity prices were also boosted by better-than-
anticipated corporate earnings and retail-sector data.  
Stock prices of firms with high exposure to China un-
derperformed the broader market somewhat, as did 
bank stocks amid downward revisions to banks’ earnings 
forecasts.  Conversely, the stock prices of utilities and 
real estate firms increased noticeably, reportedly benefit-
ing from demand by investors reaching for less cyclical 
and higher-yielding assets.  One-month option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—was little 
changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and re-
mained at the lower end of its historical distribution after 
retracing a sharp increase in early August.

Despite the volatility in many domestic and global finan-
cial markets over the intermeeting period, conditions in 
domestic short-term funding markets remained stable 
until the Monday before the September FOMC meeting, 
when flows associated with a combination of corporate 
tax payments and Treasury coupon securities settle-
ments led to significant tightening of conditions, partic-
ularly for overnight funding.  The EFFR rose to the top 
of the target range on September 16 and exceeded it by 
5 basis points on September 17, after which funding 
pressures eased somewhat following the Desk’s open 
market operations.  On net, the EFFR averaged 
2.14 percent over the current intermeeting period, with 
the spread to the IOER rate down a bit relative to the 
previous intermeeting period. 

Early in the intermeeting period, bond yields in the ad-
vanced foreign economies (AFEs) plunged and foreign 
equities declined notably following an increase in U.S.–
China trade tensions.  Some weakness in foreign eco-
nomic data, growing concerns about global growth, and 
the prospect of more monetary policy accommodation 
abroad contributed to further declines in yields.  Later in 
the period, AFE yields partially rebounded and foreign 
equity prices fully recovered on some easing of U.S.–
China trade tensions, as well as perceptions of reduced 
political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and Italy.  
Financial market reactions were mixed after the Euro-
pean Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of policy 
easing measures, including a rate cut on deposits at the 
ECB, resumption of its asset purchase program, and 
more favorable terms for longer-term lending to banks.     

The dollar appreciated against emerging market curren-
cies but was little changed, on balance, against AFE cur-
rencies, leaving the broad dollar index slightly higher.  
Emerging market sovereign bond spreads widened no-
tably.  The Argentine peso depreciated sharply and Ar-
gentine sovereign yields soared following the defeat of 
the current pro-market president in the primary election 
and the subsequent announcement of plans for debt re-
structuring and the imposition of capital controls. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re-
mained accommodative.  Overall issuance of corporate 
bonds was solid in August, driven by resilient invest-
ment-grade issuance.  While speculative-grade corporate 
bond issuance was somewhat subdued in August, it was 
comparable to that seen over the same period in 2018.  
Growth of commercial and industrial loans at banks 
ticked up, driven by faster growth at large domestic 
banks.  There were no initial public equity offerings by 

domestic firms in August amid increased market volatil-
ity, but several deals were expected to be completed in 
the coming months.  On balance, the credit quality of 
nonfinancial corporations weakened slightly, with the 
volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades 
modestly outpacing that of upgrades in recent months.  
Credit conditions for both small businesses and munici-
palities remained accommodative on balance. 

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions remained generally accommodative.  Bank 
CRE loan growth slowed moderately since the second 
quarter, driven by slower growth in loans secured by 
nonfarm nonresidential properties.  The volume of 
agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed 
securities issuance was slightly weaker in July and August 
than in the same period last year, though industry ana-
lysts reportedly anticipated that issuance would soon 
pick up in response to recent declines in interest rates. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
eased over the intermeeting period.  Residential mort-
gage rates declined less than long-term Treasury yields, 
as the increase in prepayment risk and the rise in implied 
interest rate volatility reportedly reduced the demand for 
mortgage-backed securities.  Home-purchase origina-
tions and refinancing originations both rose. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally supportive of growth in consumer 
spending, although supply conditions continued to be 
tight for subprime credit card borrowers.  Consumer 
credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter 
overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued 
growth through July and August.  In consumer asset-
backed securities markets, issuance was solid, and 
spreads remained at relatively low levels, though some-
what above their post-crisis averages. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by 
the staff for the September FOMC meeting was little 
changed in the near term; real GDP growth was still 
forecast to be slower in the second half of the year than 
in the first half, mostly attributable to continued soft 
business investment and a slower increase in govern-
ment spending.  The projection for real GDP growth 
over the medium term was a bit weaker than the previ-
ous forecast, primarily reflecting the effects of a higher 
projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dol-
lar and a lower trajectory for economic growth abroad, 
which were partially offset by a lower assumed path for 
interest rates.  Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate 
a little above the staff’s estimate of potential output 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly 
below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.  The 
unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat 
through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of 
its longer-run natural rate, which was revised down a lit-
tle.  In addition, the staff revised up its estimate of the 
level of trend productivity in recent years after incorpo-
rating the BEA’s recent annual revisions to the national 
income and product accounts.  Both of these supply-side 
adjustments led to a somewhat higher projected path for 
potential output, implying that estimates of current and 
projected resource utilization were less tight than the 
staff previously assumed.  

The staff’s forecast of total PCE price inflation for this 
year was revised down somewhat, reflecting slightly 
lower projected paths for consumer food and energy 
prices, along with a little lower forecast for core PCE 
prices.  The core PCE price inflation forecast for this 
year was revised down to reflect recent data as well as 
downward-revised data for earlier in the year from the 
BEA’s annual revision.  Both total and core inflation 
were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low 
readings early this year were expected to be transitory; 
nevertheless, both inflation measures were forecast to 
continue to run below 2 percent through 2022. 

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of 
the past 20 years.  Moreover, the staff still judged that 
the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted 
to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up-
side for the unemployment rate.  Important factors in 
that assessment were that international trade tensions 
and foreign economic developments seemed more likely 
to move in directions that could have significant nega-
tive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more 
favorably than assumed.  In addition, softness in busi-
ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was 
seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial 
slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  
The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as 
having a downward skew, in part because of the down-
side risks to the forecast for economic activity 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook  
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and 

over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections are described 
in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an 
addendum to these minutes.  

Participants agreed that the labor market had remained 
strong over the intermeeting period and that economic 
activity had risen at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been 
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had remained low.  Although household 
spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in-
vestment and exports had weakened.  On a 12-month 
basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than 
food and energy were running below 2 percent.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation remained 
low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation ex-
pectations were little changed. 

Participants generally viewed the baseline economic out-
look as positive and indicated that their views of the 
most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation 
had changed little since the July meeting.  However, for 
most participants, that economic outlook was premised 
on a somewhat more accommodative path for policy 
than in July.  Participants generally had become more 
concerned about risks associated with trade tensions and 
adverse developments in the geopolitical and global eco-
nomic spheres.  In addition, inflation pressures contin-
ued to be muted.  Many participants expected that real 
GDP growth would moderate to around its potential 
rate in the second half of the year.  Participants agreed 
that consumer spending was increasing at a strong pace.  
They also expected that, in the period ahead, household 
spending would likely remain on a firm footing, sup-
ported by strong labor market conditions, rising in-
comes, and accommodative financial conditions.  Sev-
eral participants indicated that the housing sector was 
starting to rebound, stimulated by a significant decline in 
mortgage rates.  With regard to the contrast between ro-
bust consumption growth and weak investment growth, 
several participants mentioned that uncertainties in the 
business outlook and sustained weak investment could 
eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could 
damp the growth of income and consumption. 

In their discussion of the business sector, participants 
saw trade tensions and concerns about the global out-

look as the main factors weighing on business invest-
ment, exports, and manufacturing production.  Partici-
pants judged that trade uncertainty and global develop-
ments would continue to affect firms’ investment spend-
ing, and that this uncertainty was discouraging them 
from investing in their businesses.  A couple of partici-
pants noted that businesses had the capacity to adjust to 
ongoing uncertainty concerning trade, and some firms 
were reconfiguring supply chains and making logistical 
arrangements as part of contingency planning to mitigate 
the effects of trade tensions on their businesses. 

Participants discussed developments in the manufactur-
ing and the agricultural sectors of the U.S. economy.  
Manufacturing production remained lower than at the 
beginning of the year, and recent indicators suggested 
that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over 
the near term.  Participants saw the ongoing global slow-
down and trade uncertainty as contributing importantly 
to these declines.  A few participants noted ongoing 
challenges in the agricultural sector, including those as-
sociated with tariffs, weak export demand, and more in-
tense financial burdens arising from the increase in car-
ryover debt in preceding years.  Participants commented 
on the potential disruption to global oil production aris-
ing from the attack on Saudi Arabia’s facilities.  

Participants judged that conditions in the labor market 
remained strong, with the unemployment rate near his-
torical lows and continued solid job gains, on average, in 
recent months.  The labor force participation rate of 
prime-age individuals, especially of prime-age women, 
moved up in August, continuing its upward trajectory, 
and the unemployment rate of African Americans fell to 
its lowest rate on record.  However, a number of partic-
ipants noted that, although the labor market was clearly 
in a strong position, the preliminary benchmark revision 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that payroll 
employment gains would likely show less momentum 
coming into this year when the revisions are incorpo-
rated in published data early next year.  A few partici-
pants observed that it would be important to be vigilant 
in monitoring incoming data for any sign of softening in 
labor market conditions.  That said, reports from busi-
ness contacts in many Districts pointed to continued 
strong labor demand, with some firms still reporting dif-
ficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening 
their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized 
groups.  In some Districts, employers were also expand-
ing training and provision of nonwage benefits, which 
could help sustain their expansion of hiring against a 
background of a very tight national labor market without 
spurring above-trend aggregate wage growth.  Some 

firms were also reluctant to raise wages because of their 
limited pricing power, while others thought the wages 
they were offering were in line with the skill sets of the 
workers available to fill new positions.  Participants gen-
erally viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent 
with modest average rates of labor productivity growth 
in recent years and as exerting little upward pressure on 
inflation.  A couple of participants noted that, with in-
flationary pressures remaining muted and wage growth 
moderate even as employment and spending expanded 
further, they had again adjusted downward their esti-
mates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. 

In their discussion of inflation developments, partici-
pants noted that, despite a recent firming in the incom-
ing data, readings on overall and core PCE inflation had 
continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective.  Furthermore, in light of weakness 
in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to 
growth, and subdued inflation pressures, some partici-
pants continued to view the risks to the outlook for in-
flation as weighted to the downside.  Some participants, 
however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with 
their previous assessment that much of the weakness 
seen early in the year was transitory.  In this connection, 
several participants noted that recent monthly readings, 
notably for CPI inflation, seemed broadly consistent 
with the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective of 
2 percent, while the trimmed mean measure of PCE in-
flation, constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal-
las, remained at 2 percent in July.   

In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, partici-
pants generally agreed that, under appropriate policy, in-
flation would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective over the medium term.  Participants saw inflation 
expectations as reasonably well anchored, but many par-
ticipants observed that market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation and some survey measures of con-
sumers’ inflation expectations were at historically low 
levels.  Some of these participants further noted that 
longer-term inflation expectations could be somewhat 
below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective, or that continued weakness in infla-
tion could prompt expectations to drift lower. 

Participants generally judged that downside risks to the 
outlook for economic activity had increased somewhat 
since their July meeting, particularly those stemming 
from trade policy uncertainty and conditions abroad.  In 
addition, although readings on the labor market and the 
overall economy continued to be strong, a clearer picture 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

of protracted weakness in investment spending, manu-
facturing production, and exports had emerged.  Partic-
ipants also noted that there continued to be a significant 
probability of a no-deal Brexit, and that geopolitical ten-
sions had increased in Hong Kong and the Middle East.  
Several participants commented that, in the wake of this 
increase in downside risk, the weakness in business 
spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to 
slower hiring, a development that would likely weigh on 
consumption and the overall economic outlook.  Several 
participants noted that statistical models designed to 
gauge the probability of recession, including those based 
on information from the yield curve, suggested that the 
likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium 
term had increased notably in recent months.  However, 
a couple of these participants stressed the difficulty of 
extracting the right signal from these probability models, 
especially in the current period of unusually low levels of 
term premiums. 

With regard to developments in financial markets, par-
ticipants noted that longer-term U.S. Treasury rates had 
been volatile over the intermeeting period but, on net, 
had registered a sizable decline.  Participants observed 
that a key source of downward pressure on Treasury 
rates arose from flight-to-safety flows, driven by down-
side risks to global growth, escalating trade tensions, and 
disappointing global data.  Low interest rates abroad 
were also considered an important influence on U.S. 
longer-term rates.  Participants expressed a range of 
views about the implications of low longer-term Treas-
ury rates.  Some participants judged that a prolonged in-
version of the yield curve could be a matter of concern.  
Participants also noted that equity prices had exhibited 
volatility but had been largely flat, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period.  Several participants cited consider-
ations that led them to be concerned about financial sta-
bility, including low risk spreads and a buildup of corpo-
rate debt, corporate stock buybacks financed through 
low-cost leverage, and the pace of lending in the CRE 
market.  However, several others pointed to signs that 
the financial system remained resilient. 

In their consideration of the monetary policy options at 
this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction 
of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds 
rate would be appropriate.  In discussing the reasons for 
such a decision, these participants pointed to considera-
tions related to the economic outlook, risk management, 
and the need to center inflation and inflation expecta-
tions on the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 per-
cent. 

Participants noted that there had been little change in 
their economic outlook since the July meeting and that 
incoming data had continued to suggest that the pace of 
economic expansion was consistent with the mainte-
nance of strong labor market conditions.  However, a 
couple of participants pointed out that data revisions an-
nounced in recent months implied that the economy had 
likely entered the year with somewhat less momentum 
than previously thought.  In addition, data received since 
July had confirmed the weakening in business fixed in-
vestment and exports.  One risk that the economy faced 
was that the softness recorded of late in firms’ capital 
formation, manufacturing, and exporting activities 
might spread to their hiring decisions, with adverse im-
plications for household income and spending.  Partici-
pants observed that such an eventuality was not embed-
ded in their baseline outlook; however, a couple of them 
indicated that this was partly because they assumed that 
an appropriate adjustment to the policy rate path would 
help forestall that eventuality.  Several also noted that, 
because monetary policy actions affected economic ac-
tivity with a lag, it was appropriate to provide the requi-
site policy accommodation now to support economic ac-
tivity over coming quarters. 

Participants favoring a modest adjustment to the stance 
of monetary policy at this juncture cited other risks to 
the economic outlook that further underscored the case 
for such a move.  As their discussion of risks had high-
lighted, downside risks had become more pronounced 
since July:  Trade uncertainty had increased, prospects 
for global growth had become more fragile, and various 
intermeeting developments had intensified geopolitical 
risks.  Against this background, risk-management con-
siderations implied that it would be prudent for the 
Committee to adopt a somewhat more accommodative 
stance of policy.  In addition, a number of participants 
suggested that a reduction at this meeting in the target 
range for the federal funds rate would likely better align 
the target range with a variety of indicators of the appro-
priate policy stance, including those based on estimates 
of the neutral interest rate.  A few participants observed 
that the considerations favoring easing were reinforced 
by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the ELB.  If 
policymakers provided adequate accommodation while 
still away from the ELB, this course of action would help 
forestall the possibility of a prolonged ELB episode. 

Many participants also cited the level of inflation or in-
flation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis 
points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Inflation 
had generally fallen short of the Committee’s objective 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

for several years and, notwithstanding some stronger re-
cent monthly readings on inflation, the 12-month rate 
was still below 2 percent.  Some estimates of trend infla-
tion were also below 2 percent.  Several participants ad-
ditionally stressed that survey measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations and market-based measures of in-
flation compensation were near historical lows and that 
these values pointed to the possibility that inflation ex-
pectations were below levels consistent with the 2 per-
cent objective or could soon fall below such levels.  
Against this backdrop, participants suggested that a pol-
icy easing would help underline policymakers’ commit-
ment to the symmetric 2 percent longer-run objective.  
With inflation pressures muted and U.S. inflation likely 
being weighed down by global disinflationary forces, 
policymakers saw little chance of an outsized increase in 
inflation in response to additional policy accommoda-
tion and argued that such an increase, should it occur, 
could be addressed in a straightforward manner using 
conventional monetary policy tools.   

Several participants favored maintaining the existing tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  
These participants suggested that the baseline projection 
for the economy had changed very little since the Com-
mittee’s previous meeting and that the state of the econ-
omy and the economic outlook did not justify a shift 
away from the current policy stance, which they felt was 
already adequately accommodative.  They acknowledged 
the uncertainties that currently figured importantly in 
evaluations of the economic outlook, but they con-
tended that the key uncertainties were unlikely to be re-
solved soon.  Furthermore, as they did not believe that 
these uncertainties would derail the expansion, they did 
not see further policy accommodation as needed at this 
time.  Changes in the stance of policy, they believed, 
should instead occur only when the macroeconomic 
data readily justified those moves.  In this connection, a 
couple of participants suggested that, if it decided to pro-
vide more policy accommodation at the present junc-
ture, the Committee might be taking out too much in-
surance against possible future shocks, leaving monetary 
policy with less scope to boost aggregate demand in the 
event that such shocks materialized.  A few of the par-
ticipants favoring an unchanged target range for the fed-
eral funds rate also expressed concern that an easing of 
monetary policy at this meeting could exacerbate finan-
cial imbalances. 

A couple of participants indicated their preference for a 
50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meet-
ing.  These participants suggested that a larger policy 

move would help reduce the risk of an economic down-
turn and would more appropriately recognize important 
recent developments, such as slowing job gains, weaken-
ing investment, and continued low values of market-
based measures of inflation compensation.  In addition, 
these participants stressed the need for a policy stance—
possibly one using enhanced forward guidance—that 
was sufficiently accommodative to make it unlikely that 
the United States would experience a protracted period 
of the kind seen abroad in which the economy became 
mired in a combination of undesirably low inflation, 
weak economic activity, and near-zero policy rates.  They 
also argued that it was desirable for the Committee to 
seek and maintain a level of accommodation sufficient 
to deliver inflation at 2 percent on a sustained basis and 
that such a policy would be consistent with inflation ex-
ceeding 2 percent for a time. 

With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, 
participants agreed that policy was not on a preset course 
and would depend on the implications of incoming in-
formation for the evolution of the economic outlook.  A 
few participants judged that the expectations regarding 
the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in 
financial markets were currently suggesting greater pro-
vision of accommodation at coming meetings than they 
saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary 
for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market 
expectations regarding the policy rate path with policy-
makers’ own expectations for that path.  Several partici-
pants suggested that the Committee’s postmeeting state-
ment should provide more clarity about when the recal-
ibration of the level of the policy rate in response to 
trade uncertainty would likely come to an end. 

Participants’ Discussion of Recent Money Market 
Developments  
The manager pro tem provided a summary of the most 
recent developments in money markets.  Open market 
operations conducted on the previous day had helped to 
ease strains in money markets, but the EFFR had none-
theless printed 5 basis points above the top of the target 
range.  With significant pressures still evident in repo 
markets and the federal funds market, and in accordance 
with the FOMC’s directive to maintain the federal funds 
rate within the target range, the Desk conducted another 
repo operation on the morning of the second day of the 
meeting.  The staff presented a proposal to lower the 
IOER rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agree-
ment rate by 5 basis points, relative to the target range 
for the federal funds rate, in order to foster trading of 
federal funds within the target range.   

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

Participants agreed that developments in money markets 
over recent days implied that the Committee should 
soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances 
sufficient to support efficient and effective implementa-
tion of monetary policy in the context of the ample-re-
serves regime that the Committee had chosen.  A few 
participants noted the possibility of resuming trend 
growth of the balance sheet to help stabilize the level of 
reserves in the banking system.  Participants agreed that 
any Committee decision regarding the trend pace of bal-
ance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of re-
serve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implemen-
tation should be clearly distinguished from past large-
scale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering 
the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s asset 
holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommo-
dation and ease overall financial conditions.  Several par-
ticipants suggested that such a discussion could benefit 
from also considering the merits of introducing a stand-
ing repurchase agreement facility as part of the frame-
work for implementing monetary policy. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members noted that information received since the July 
meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong 
and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate 
rate.  Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.  
Household spending had been rising at a strong pace.  
However, business fixed investment and exports had 
weakened, and this outcome suggested that risks and un-
certainty associated with international trade develop-
ments and with ongoing weakness in global economic 
growth were continuing to weigh on the domestic econ-
omy.  On a 12-month basis, both the overall inflation 
rate and inflation for items other than food and energy 
were running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remained low.  Survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed.  In light of these developments, most mem-
bers agreed to lower the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent at this meeting. 

With this adjustment to policy, those members who sup-
ported the policy action sought to make the overall 
stance of monetary policy most consistent with helping 
to offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global 
growth and trade policy uncertainty, insure against fur-
ther downside risks arising from those sources and from 
geopolitical developments, and promote a more rapid 
return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 per-
cent objective than would otherwise occur.  A couple of 

these members observed that, because monetary policy 
actions affected aggregate spending with a lag, the pre-
sent meeting was an appropriate occasion for providing 
accommodation that would support economic activity in 
the period ahead.  Two members preferred to maintain 
the current target range for the federal funds rate at this 
meeting.  These members noted that economic data re-
ceived over the intermeeting period had been largely 
positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged 
policy stance, continued strong labor markets and solid 
growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  These members 
also suggested that providing further accommodation 
during a period of high economic activity and elevated 
asset prices could have adverse consequences for finan-
cial stability.  One member preferred a reduction in the 
target range of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate 
at this meeting.  This member suggested that such a 
larger rate adjustment would be more consistent with the 
achievement of the Committee’s objectives over time 
and, in particular, with helping preclude the possibility 
of a protracted period in which inflation and employ-
ment were below the Committee’s objectives. 

Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its maximum-
employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objective.  They also agreed that those assessments 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to update the language of the Committee’s de-
scription of incoming data to acknowledge the weaken-
ing in investment spending and in U.S. exports, as well 
as the recent strong rate of increase of household spend-
ing. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective September 19, 2019, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 1¾ to 2 percent, including overnight

reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury 
securities and to continue reinvesting all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.  Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in Treasury securities to roughly match 
the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in July indicates that the 
labor market remains strong and that economic 
activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job 
gains have been solid, on average, in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate has re-
mained low.  Although household spending has 
been rising at a strong pace, business fixed in-
vestment and exports have weakened.  On a  
12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation 
for items other than food and energy are run-
ning below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expec-
tations are little changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  In light of the implications 
of global developments for the economic out-
look as well as muted inflation pressures, the 
Committee decided to lower the target range for 
the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent.  This 
action supports the Committee’s view that sus-
tained expansion of economic activity, strong 
labor market conditions, and inflation near the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are 
the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties 
about this outlook remain.  As the Committee 
contemplates the future path of the target range 
for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
monitor the implications of incoming infor-
mation for the economic outlook and will act as 
appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a 
strong labor market and inflation near its sym-
metric 2 percent objective. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, and Randal K. Quarles. 

Voting against this action:  James Bullard, Esther L. 
George, and Eric Rosengren. 

President Bullard dissented because he believed that 
lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 
50 basis points at this time would provide insurance 
against further declines in expected inflation and a slow-
ing economy subject to elevated downside risks.  In ad-
dition, a 50 basis point cut at this time would help pro-
mote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation ex-
pectations to target.  President George dissented be-
cause she believed that an unchanged setting of policy 
was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook 
for economic activity over the medium term.  Recogniz-
ing the risks to the outlook from the effects of trade pol-
icy and weaker global activity, President George would 
be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point

to a materially weaker outlook for the economy.  Presi-
dent Rosengren dissented because he judged that mon-
etary policy was already accommodative.  In his view, 
additional accommodation was not needed for an econ-
omy in which labor markets are already tight and could 
pose risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets 
and encouraging households and firms to take on too 
much leverage. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the 
target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent, 
the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the 
interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 
to 1.80 percent and voted unanimously to approve a 
¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 
2.50 percent, effective September 19, 2019.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 29–
30, 2019.  The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on Sep-
tember 18, 2019. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on August 20, 2019, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on July 30–31, 2019.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 17–18, 2019, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run.  
Each participant’s projections were based on infor-
mation available at the time of the meeting, together with 
his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-
run value—and assumptions about other factors likely 
to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the 
value to which each variable would be expected to con-
verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and 
in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Ap-
propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos-
ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that 
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the 
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability.   

Participants who submitted longer-run projections ex-
pected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth 
of real GDP in 2019 would run slightly or somewhat 
above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate.  
Participants expected real GDP growth to edge down 
over the projection horizon, with all participants project-
ing growth in 2022 to be at or modestly below their es-
timates of its longer-run rate.  Almost all participants 
who submitted longer-run projections expected that the 
unemployment rate through 2022 would run below their 
estimates of its longer-run level.  All participants contin-
ued to project that total inflation, as measured by the 
four-quarter percent change in the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase 
from 2019 to 2020, and many expected another slight 
increase in 2021.  The vast majority of participants ex-
pected that inflation would be at or slightly above the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021 and 2022.  The 
median of participants’ projections for core PCE price 
inflation increased over the projection period, rising to 
2.0 percent in 2021.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide sum-
mary statistics for the projections.  Compared with the 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June 
                                                            
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate. 

2019, some participants slightly revised down their esti-
mates of the longer-run unemployment rate; the median 
estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate was un-
changed.  Participants’ projections for total and core in-
flation were generally little changed compared with their 
projections in June.   

As shown in figure 2, participants expected that the evo-
lution of the economy, relative to their objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would 
likely warrant a federal funds rate target by the end of 
this year at or below the target range that the Committee 
adopted at its July 30–31 meeting.  Compared with the 
June SEP submissions, the median projection for the 
federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower for the end 
of 2019 and 25 basis points lower for the end of 2020 
and 2021.  In the September SEP submissions, the me-
dian for the federal funds rate for 2020 was equal to the 
median for 2019.  The median of participants’ assess-
ments of the appropriate level for the federal funds rate 
in 2022 was slightly below the median of participants’ 
estimates of its longer-run level.  Some participants re-
vised lower their assessments of the longer-run federal 
funds rate, but the median assessment of the longer-run 
federal funds rate was unchanged.   

Most participants regarded the uncertainties around 
their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core 
inflation as broadly similar to the average over the past 
20 years.  Just over half of the participants viewed the 
level of uncertainty around their unemployment rate 
projections as being similar to the average of the past 
20 years, while the rest of the participants viewed uncer-
tainty as higher.  Most participants assessed the risks to 
their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the 
downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to 
the upside.  Most participants judged the risks to the in-
flation outlook as broadly balanced; some participants 
viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, 
and no participant assessed risks to inflation as weighted 
to the upside.  Participants’ assessments of the uncer-
tainties and risks around their forecasts for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate were little changed 
overall relative to June.  The uncertainties around their 
projections for headline and core inflation were little

changed as well, but more participants saw the inflation 
risks as broadly balanced than in June.  

The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemploy-
ment 
As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projec-
tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi-
tional on their individual assessments of appropriate 
monetary policy, was 2.2 percent, a bit above the median 
estimate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent.  Almost all 
participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow 
over the projection period, with the median projection 
at 2.0 percent in 2020, 1.9 percent in 2021, and 1.8 per-
cent in 2022.  Relative to the June SEP, the medians of 
the projections for real GDP growth in 2019, 2020, 
2021, and the longer run were unchanged or revised 
slightly higher.  

The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, ½ percentage 
point below the median assessment of its longer-run 
level of 4.2 percent.  The medians of projections for 
2020, 2021, and 2022 were 3.7 percent, 3.8 percent, and 
3.9 percent, respectively.  The median projected unem-
ployment rate for 2019 was slightly higher than in the 
June SEP, while the median projected unemployment 
rates for 2020 and 2021 were unchanged relative to the 
June SEP.  A vast majority of participants who submit-
ted longer-run projections expected that the unemploy-
ment rate in 2022 would be below their estimates of its 
longer-run level, with some participants projecting a gap 
of ½ percentage point or more.   

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate, respectively, from 2019 to 2022 and in 
the longer run.  The distribution of individual projec-
tions for real GDP growth for 2019 shifted up some-
what relative to that in the June SEP.  The distributions 
of individual projections of real GDP growth for 2020 
and 2021 and for the longer run were little changed over-
all.  The distributions of individual projections for the 
unemployment rate for 2019 to 2021 and for the longer 
run were also little changed overall relative to those in 
June.   

The Outlook for Inflation 
As shown in table 1, the median of projections for total 
PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2019, 1.9 percent 
in 2020, and 2.0 percent in 2021; these medians were un-
changed from June.  For 2022, the median projection for 
total PCE was 2.0 percent.  The medians of projections 
for core PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent for 2019 
and 1.9 percent for 2020.  The median projections for 

core inflation for 2021 and 2022 were 2.0 percent.  These 
medians were also unchanged from June for each year 
included in the June SEP.   

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of projections for total and 
core PCE price inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 were 
little changed overall relative to those in June.  For 2022, 
all participants projected total and core inflation between 
1.8 and 2.2 percent. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of 
each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run.  
Compared with the June projections, the range of pro-
jections for 2019, 2020, and 2021 shifted toward lower 
values and narrowed somewhat.  The vast majority of 
participants viewed the appropriate levels of the federal 
funds rate at the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 as lower 
than those that they deemed appropriate in June.  All 
participants lowered their projections for the appropri-
ate level of the federal funds rate, relative to June, at 
some point in the projection period, and none raised 
their projections for the federal funds rate for any year.  
Compared with the projections prepared for the June 
SEP, the median federal funds rate was 50 basis points 
lower in 2019 and 25 basis points lower in 2020 and 
2021.  Muted inflation pressures, slower global growth, 
and weak business fixed investment were cited as rea-
sons for downward revisions to the appropriate path for 
the federal funds rate, as were trade tensions and risk-
management considerations.   

The median federal funds rate projection for the end of 
2019 was 1.88 percent.  Seven participants assessed that 
the most likely appropriate federal funds rate at the end 
of 2019 was 1.63 percent, while five assessed that the 
most likely appropriate rate at year-end was 2.13 percent.  
The median for 2020 was 1.88 percent, equal to the me-
dian for 2019.  For subsequent years, the medians of the 
projections were 2.13 percent at the end of 2021 and 
2.38 percent at the end of 2022.  Some participants re-
vised lower their estimates of the longer-run level of the 
federal funds rate, while a majority of participants’ esti-
mates were unchanged.  The median estimate of the 
longer-run federal funds rate was 2.50 percent, un-
changed from the median estimate in June.   

Uncertainty and Risks  
In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of

possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those 
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government forecasts over the past 
20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and total PCE price inflation.  Those measures are rep-
resented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts dis-
play the SEP medians for the three variables surrounded 
by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the 
forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the degree of un-
certainty attending these projections is similar to the typ-
ical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, then future 
outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 per-
cent probability of being within these confidence inter-
vals.  For all three variables, this measure of uncertainty 
is substantial and generally increases as the forecast hori-
zon lengthens. 

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  Most participants continued to view the uncertain-
ties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total infla-
tion, and core inflation as broadly similar to the average 
over the past 20 years.  Just over half of the participants 
viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemploy-
ment rate projections as being similar to the average of 
the past 20 years, while the rest of the participants 
viewed uncertainty as higher.2   

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their current economic 
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants continued to 
view the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as 
weighted to the downside and for the unemployment 
rate as weighted to the upside.  Most participants—four 
more than in the June SEP—judged the risks to the in-
flation outlook as broadly balanced; some participants 
viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, 
and no participants assessed risks to inflation as 
weighted to the upside.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assump-
tions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for 
real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate 
will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made 
in the past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to 
fourth quarter basis. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury 
bills.  Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, 
in the fourth quarter. 

 

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, several participants mentioned 
trade developments, concerns about foreign economic 
growth, and weaker business fixed investment as sources 
of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. economic 
growth outlook.  For the inflation outlook, the possibil-
ity that inflation expectations could be drifting below 
levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation 
objective and the potential for weaker domestic demand 
to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as 
downside risks.  A few participants noted the possibility 
that higher tariffs could lead to aggregate price pressure 
as a source of upside risk to inflation.  A number of par-
ticipants mentioned that their assessments of risks re-
mained roughly balanced, in part because the downward 
revisions to their appropriate path for the federal funds 
rate were offsetting factors that would otherwise con-
tribute to asymmetric risks. 

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal 

used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici-
pants’ projections.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the

and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years;
more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the
basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and
risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20
years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For
definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-
opments over time in key economic variables—such as 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion—uncertainty surrounding the projected path for 
the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertain-
ties about the paths for these economic variables, along 
with other factors.  Figure 5 provides a graphic represen-
tation of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for 
the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence inter-
vals derived from the results presented in table 2.3  As 
with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncer-
tainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal 
funds rate is substantial and increases for longer hori-
zons.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of
the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.8 to 4.2 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 
4.8 percent in the second year, 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the third 
year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third 
year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year.  Figures 4.A 
through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan 
charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of 
FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation.  However, in some instances, 
the risks around the projections may not be symmetric.  In 
particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; fur-
thermore, the risks around a particular projection might be 
tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the 
corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned 
around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur- 

rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-
tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
