Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on 
April 26–27, 2011.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the continuing reinvest-
ment into longer-term Treasury securities of principal 
payments received on the SOMA’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securi-
ties, as well as the ongoing purchases of additional 
Treasury securities authorized at the November 2–3, 

2010, FOMC meeting.  Since November, purchases by 
the Open Market Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York had increased the SOMA’s holdings by 
nearly the full $600 billion authorized.   

In light of ongoing strains in some foreign financial 
markets, the Committee considered a proposal to ex-
tend its dollar liquidity swap arrangements with foreign 
central banks past August 1, 2011.  Following their dis-
cussion, members unanimously approved the following 
resolution: 

The Federal Open Market Committee directs 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to 
extend the existing temporary reciprocal cur-
rency arrangements (“swap arrangements”) 
for the System Open Market Account with 
the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, 
the European Central Bank, the Bank of Ja-
pan, and the Swiss National Bank.  The swap 
arrangements shall now terminate on Au-
gust 1, 2012, unless further extended by the 
Committee.   

Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models 
A staff presentation provided an overview of ongoing 
Federal Reserve research on dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) models.  DSGE models attempt 
to capture the dynamics of the overall economy in a 
way that is consistent both with the historical data and 
with optimizing behavior by forward-looking house-
holds and firms.  The presentation began by discussing 
the general features of DSGE models and considering 
their advantages and limitations relative to other ap-
proaches of analyzing macroeconomic dynamics; with 
regard to the latter, the presentation noted that while 
the current generation of DSGE models is still some-
what limited in the range of policy issues these models 
can address, further advances in modeling should in-
crease the usefulness of DSGE models for forecasting 
and policy analysis.  The presentation then reviewed 
some specific features of DSGE models that are cur-
rently being studied at the Federal Reserve Board and 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, 
and Chicago.  This review included the four models’ 
characterizations of the forces affecting the economy in 
recent years and the models’ current forecasts for real 
economic activity, inflation, and short-term interest 
rates.  In discussing the staff presentation, meeting par-
ticipants expressed the view that DSGE models are a 
useful addition to the wide range of analytical ap-
proaches traditionally used at the Federal Reserve, in 
part because they provide an internally consistent way

of exploring how the behavior of economic agents 
might change in response to systematic adjustments to 
policy.  Some participants also expressed interest in 
seeing on a regular basis projections of key macroeco-
nomic variables and other products from the DSGE 
models developed in the System.  Finally, participants 
encouraged further staff work to improve these models 
by, for example, expanding the range of questions they 
can be used to address. 

Exit Strategy Principles 
The Committee discussed strategies for normalizing the 
stance and conduct of monetary policy, following up 
on its discussion of this topic at the April meeting.  
Participants stressed that the Committee’s discussions 
of this topic were undertaken as part of prudent plan-
ning and did not imply that a move toward such nor-
malization would necessarily begin sometime soon.  
For concreteness, the Committee considered a set of 
specific principles that would guide its strategy of nor-
malizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy.  
Participants discussed several specific elements of the 
principles, including how they should characterize the 
monetary policy framework that the Committee would 
adopt after the conduct of policy returned to normal 
and whether the principles should encompass the pos-
sible timing between the normalization steps.  At the 
conclusion of the discussion, all but one of the partici-
pants agreed on the following key elements of the 
strategy that they expect to follow when it becomes 
appropriate to begin normalizing the stance and con-
duct of monetary policy: 

 The Committee will determine the timing and pace 
of policy normalization to promote its statutory 
mandate of maximum employment and price sta-
bility. 

 To begin the process of policy normalization, the 
Committee will likely first cease reinvesting some 
or all payments of principal on the securities hold-
ings in the SOMA.   

 At the same time or sometime thereafter, the 
Committee will modify its forward guidance on the 
path of the federal funds rate and will initiate tem-
porary reserve-draining operations aimed at sup-
porting the implementation of increases in the fed-
eral funds rate when appropriate. 

 When economic conditions warrant, the Commit-
tee’s next step in the process of policy normaliza-
tion will be to begin raising its target for the federal 
funds rate, and from that point on, changing the 

level or range of the federal funds rate target will 
be the primary means of adjusting the stance of 
monetary policy.  During the normalization 
process, adjustments to the interest rate on excess 
reserves and to the level of reserves in the banking 
system will be used to bring the funds rate toward 
its target. 

 Sales of agency securities from the SOMA will like-
ly commence sometime after the first increase in 
the target for the federal funds rate.  The timing 
and pace of sales will be communicated to the pub-
lic in advance; that pace is anticipated to be rela-
tively gradual and steady, but it could be adjusted 
up or down in response to material changes in the 
economic outlook or financial conditions. 

 Once sales begin, the pace of sales is expected to 
be aimed at eliminating the SOMA’s holdings of 
agency securities over a period of three to five 
years, thereby minimizing the extent to which the 
SOMA portfolio might affect the allocation of  
credit across sectors of the economy.  Sales at this 
pace would be expected to normalize the size of 
the SOMA securities portfolio over a period of two 
to three years.  In particular, the size of the securi-
ties portfolio and the associated quantity of bank 
reserves are expected to be reduced to the smallest 
levels that would be consistent with the efficient 
implementation of monetary policy. 

 The Committee is prepared to make adjustments to 
its exit strategy if necessary in light of economic 
and financial developments.  

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the June 21–22 meeting 
indicated that the pace of the economic recovery 
slowed in recent months and that conditions in the 
labor market had softened.  Measures of inflation 
picked up this year, reflecting in part higher prices for 
some commodities and imported goods.  Longer-run 
inflation expectations, however, remained stable. 

The expansion of private nonfarm payroll employment 
in May was markedly below the average pace of job 
gains in the previous months of this year.  Initial claims 
for unemployment insurance rose, on net, between the 
first half of April and the first half of June.  The unem-
ployment rate moved up in April and then rose further 
to 9.1 percent in May, while the labor force participa-
tion rate remained unchanged.  Both long-duration un-
employment and the share of workers employed part 
time for economic reasons continued to be elevated. 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 21-22, 2011 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

Total industrial production expanded only a bit during 
April and May after rising at a solid pace in the first 
quarter.  Shortages of specialized components imported 
from Japan contributed to a decline in the output of 
motor vehicles and parts.  Manufacturing production 
outside of the motor vehicles sector increased mod-
erately, on balance, during the past two months.  The 
manufacturing capacity utilization rate remained close 
to its first-quarter level, but it was still well below its 
longer-run average.  Forward-looking indicators of in-
dustrial activity, such as the new orders diffusion in-
dexes in the national and regional manufacturing sur-
veys, weakened noticeably during the intermeeting pe-
riod to levels consistent with only tepid gains in factory 
output in coming months.  However, motor vehicle 
assemblies were scheduled to rise notably in the third 
quarter from their levels in recent months, as bottle-
necks in parts supplies were anticipated to ease. 

Growth in consumer spending declined in recent 
months from the already modest pace in the first quar-
ter.  Total real personal consumption expenditures only 
edged up in April.  Nominal retail sales, excluding pur-
chases at motor vehicles and parts outlets, increased 
somewhat in May, but sales of new light motor vehicles 
declined markedly.  Labor income rose moderately, as 
aggregate hours worked trended up, but total real dis-
posable income remained flat in March and April, as 
increases in consumer prices offset gains in nominal 
income.  In addition, consumer sentiment stayed rela-
tively low through early June. 

Activity in the housing market remained depressed, as 
both weak demand and the sizable inventory of fore-
closed or distressed properties continued to hold back 
new construction.  Starts and permits of new single-
family homes were essentially unchanged in April and 
May, and they stayed near the very low levels seen since 
the middle of last year.  Sales of new and existing 
homes remained at subdued levels in recent months, 
while measures of home prices fell further. 

The available indicators suggested that real business 
investment in equipment and software was rising a bit 
more slowly in the second quarter than the solid pace 
seen in the first quarter.  Nominal orders and ship-
ments of nondefense capital goods declined in April.  
Business purchases of light motor vehicles edged up in 
April but dropped in May, while spending for medium 
and heavy trucks continued to increase in recent 
months.  Survey measures of business conditions and 
sentiment weakened during the intermeeting period.  
Business expenditures for office and commercial build-

ings remained depressed by elevated vacancy rates, low 
prices for commercial real estate, and tight credit condi-
tions for construction loans.  In contrast, outlays for 
drilling and mining structures continued to be lifted by 
high energy prices. 

Real nonfarm inventory investment rose moderately in 
the first quarter, but data for April suggested that the 
pace of inventory accumulation had slowed.  Book-
value inventory-to-sales ratios in April were similar to 
their pre-recession norms, and survey data also sug-
gested that inventory positions generally remained in a 
comfortable range. 

The available data on government spending indicated 
that real federal purchases increased in recent months, 
led by a rebound in outlays for defense in April and 
May from unusually low levels in the first quarter.  In 
contrast, real expenditures by state and local govern-
ments appeared to have declined further, as outlays for 
construction projects fell in March and April, and state 
and local employment continued to contract in April 
and May. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in 
March and then narrowed in April to a level below its 
average in the first quarter.  Exports rose strongly in 
both months, with increases widespread across major 
categories in March, while the gains in April were con-
centrated in industrial supplies and capital goods.  Im-
ports grew robustly in March, but they fell slightly in 
April, as the drop in automotive imports from Japan 
together with the decline in imports of petroleum 
products more than offset increases in other imported 
products.   

Headline consumer price inflation, which had risen in 
the first quarter, edged down a bit in April and May, as 
the prices of consumer food and energy decelerated 
from the pace seen in previous months.  More recently, 
survey data through the middle of June pointed to de-
clines in retail gasoline prices, and prices of food com-
modities appeared to have decreased somewhat.  Ex-
cluding food and energy, core consumer price inflation 
picked up in April and May, pushing the 12-month 
change in the core consumer price index through May 
above its level of a year earlier.  Upward pressures on 
core consumer prices appeared to reflect the elevated 
prices of commodities and other imports, along with 
notable increases in motor vehicle prices likely arising 
from the effects of recent supply chain disruptions and 
the resulting extremely low level of automobile inven-
tories.  However, near-term inflation expectations from 
the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys

of Consumers moved down a little in May and early 
June from the high level seen in April, and longer-term 
inflation expectations remained within the range that 
has generally prevailed over the preceding few years. 

Available measures of labor compensation showed that 
labor cost pressures were still subdued, as wage in-
creases continued to be restrained by the large amount 
of slack in the labor market.  In the first quarter, unit 
labor costs only edged up, as the modest rise in hourly 
compensation in the nonfarm business sector was 
mostly offset by further gains in productivity.  More 
recently, average hourly earnings for all employees rose 
in April and May, but the average rate of increase over 
the preceding 12 months remained quite low. 

Global economic activity appeared to have increased 
more slowly in the second quarter than in the first 
quarter.  The rate of growth in the emerging market 
economies stepped down from its rapid pace in the 
first quarter, although it remained generally solid.  The 
Japanese economy contracted sharply following the 
earthquake in March, and the associated supply chain 
disruptions weighed on the economies of many of Ja-
pan’s trading partners.  The pace of economic growth 
in the euro area remained uneven, with Germany and 
France posting moderate gains in economic activity, 
while the peripheral European economies continued to 
struggle.  Recent declines in the prices of oil and other 
commodities contributed to some easing of inflationary 
pressures abroad. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investors appeared to adopt a more cautious attitude 
toward risk, particularly later in the intermeeting period.  
The shift in investors’ sentiment likely reflected the 
weak tone of incoming economic data in the United 
States along with concerns about the outlook for global 
economic growth and about potential spillovers from a 
possible further deterioration of the situation in peri-
pheral Europe. 

The decisions by the FOMC at its April meeting to 
continue its asset purchase program and to maintain 
the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate were generally in line with market expectations.  
The accompanying statement and subsequent press 
briefing by the Chairman prompted a modest decline in 
nominal yields, as market participants reportedly per-
ceived a somewhat less optimistic tone in the Commit-
tee’s economic outlook.  Over the remainder of the 
intermeeting period, the expected path for the federal 
funds rate, along with yields on nominal Treasury se-
curities, moved down appreciably further, as the bulk 

of the incoming economic data was more downbeat 
than market participants had apparently anticipated.  
Consistent with the weaker-than-expected economic 
data and the recent decline in the prices of oil and other 
commodities, measures of inflation compensation over 
the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on nom-
inal and inflation-protected Treasury securities de-
creased considerably over the intermeeting period. 

Market quotes did not suggest expectations of signifi-
cant movements in nominal Treasury yields following 
the anticipated completion of the asset purchase pro-
gram by the Federal Reserve at the end of June.  Al-
though discussions about the federal debt ceiling at-
tracted attention in financial markets, judging from 
Treasury yields and other asset prices, investors seemed 
to anticipate that the debt ceiling would be increased in 
time to avoid any significant market disruptions. 

Yields on corporate bonds stepped down modestly, on 
net, over the intermeeting period, but by less than the 
decline in yields on comparable-maturity Treasury se-
curities, leaving credit risk spreads a little wider.  In the 
secondary market for syndicated loans, conditions were 
little changed, with average bid prices for leveraged 
loans holding steady. 

Broad U.S. stock price indexes declined, on net, over 
the intermeeting period, apparently in response to the 
downbeat economic data.  Stock prices of financial 
firms underperformed the broader market, reflecting 
the weaker economic outlook, potential credit rating 
downgrades, and heightened concerns about the antic-
ipated capital surcharge for systemically important fi-
nancial institutions.  Option-adjusted volatility on the 
S&P 500 index rose somewhat on net.   

In the June 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey 
on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers pointed to a con-
tinued gradual easing over the previous three months in 
credit terms applicable to major classes of counterpar-
ties across all types of transactions covered in the sur-
vey.  Dealers also reported that the demand for funding 
had increased over the same period for a broad range 
of securities, with the exception of equities.  More re-
cently, however, against a backdrop of disappointing 
economic data, heightened uncertainty about the situa-
tion in Europe, and, possibly, concerns about the U.S. 
federal debt ceiling, market participants reported a gen-
eral pullback from risk-taking and a decline in liquidity 
in a range of financial markets.   

Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was 
strong in April and May.  Gross issuance of both in-

Minutes of the Meeting of June 21-22, 2011 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

vestment- and speculative-grade bonds by nonfinancial 
corporations hit a record high in May before slowing 
somewhat in June, and outstanding amounts of com-
mercial and industrial (C&I) loans and nonfinancial 
commercial paper increased.  Gross public equity is-
suance by nonfinancial firms maintained a solid pace 
over the intermeeting period, and most indicators of 
business credit quality improved further.   

Commercial mortgage markets continued to show ten-
tative signs of stabilization.  In recent months, delin-
quency rates for commercial real estate loans edged 
down from their previous peaks.  However, commer-
cial real estate markets remained weak.  Property sales 
were tepid, and prices remained at depressed levels.  
Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities 
slowed somewhat in the second quarter. 

Conditions in residential mortgage markets were little 
changed overall but remained strained.  Rates on con-
forming fixed-rate residential mortgages declined about 
in line with 10-year Treasury yields over the intermeet-
ing period.  Mortgage refinancing activity picked up, on 
net, over the intermeeting period but was still relatively 
subdued.  Outstanding residential mortgage debt con-
tracted further in the first quarter.  Rates of serious 
delinquency for subprime and prime mortgages were 
little changed at elevated levels.  The rate of new delin-
quencies on prime mortgages ticked up in April but 
remained well below the level of a few months ago.  In 
March and April, delinquencies on mortgages backed 
by the Federal Housing Administration declined no-
ticeably. 

The Federal Reserve continued its competitive sales of 
non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities held 
by Maiden Lane II LLC over the intermeeting period.  
Although the initial offerings of these securities were 
well received, investor demand at the most recent sales 
was not as strong, a development consistent with the 
declines in the prices of non-agency residential mort-
gage-backed securities over the intermeeting period.  

Conditions in consumer credit markets continued to 
improve.  Growth in total consumer credit picked up in 
April, as the gain in nonrevolving credit more than off-
set a further contraction in revolving credit.  Delin-
quency rates for consumer debt edged down further in 
recent months, with delinquency rates on some catego-
ries moving back to pre-crisis levels.  Issuance of con-
sumer asset-backed securities remained robust over the 
intermeeting period. 

Bank credit was flat, on balance, in April and May.  
Core loans—the sum of C&I, real estate, and consumer 
loans—continued to contract modestly, pulled down by 
the ongoing decline in commercial and residential real 
estate loans.  In contrast, C&I loans increased at a brisk 
pace in April and May.  The most recent Survey of 
Terms of Business Lending conducted in May indicated 
that banks had eased some lending terms on C&I loans.  
The survey responses also suggested that the average 
size of loan commitments and their average maturity 
had trended up in recent quarters. 

M2 expanded at a robust pace in April and May.  Liq-
uid deposits, the largest component of M2, maintained 
a solid rate of expansion, likely reflecting the very low 
opportunity costs of holding such deposits.  Currency 
continued to advance, supported by strong demand for 
U.S. bank notes from abroad. 

The broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar fluctuated 
over the intermeeting period in response to changes in 
investors’ assessment of the outlook for the U.S. econ-
omy and the situation in the peripheral European 
economies.  Since the April FOMC meeting, the dollar 
rose modestly, on net, after depreciating over the pre-
ceding several months.  Headline equity indexes abroad 
and foreign benchmark sovereign yields declined over 
the intermeeting period in apparent response to signs 
of a slowdown in the pace of global economic activity 
and reduced demand for risky assets.  Concerns about 
the possibility of a restructuring of Greek government 
debt drove spreads of yields on the sovereign debts of 
Greece, Ireland, and Portugal to record highs relative 
to yields on German bunds. 

In the advanced foreign economies, most central banks 
left their policy rates unchanged, and the anticipated 
pace of monetary policy tightening indicated by money 
market futures quotes was pared back.  However, cen-
tral banks in several emerging market economies con-
tinued to tighten policy, and the monetary authorities in 
China increased required reserve ratios further. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
With the recent data on spending, income, production, 
and labor market conditions mostly weaker than the 
staff had anticipated at the time of the April FOMC 
meeting, the near-term projection for the rate of in-
crease in real gross domestic product (GDP) was re-
vised down.  The effects of the disaster in Japan and of 
higher commodity prices on the rate of increase in real 
consumer spending were expected to hold down U.S. 
real GDP growth in the near term, but those effects 
were anticipated to be transitory.  However, the staff 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

also read the incoming economic data as suggesting 
that the underlying pace of the recovery was softer than 
they had previously anticipated, and they marked down 
their outlook for economic growth over the medium 
term.  Nevertheless, the staff still projected real GDP 
to increase at a moderate rate in the second half of 
2011 and in 2012, with the ongoing recovery in activity 
receiving continued support from accommodative 
monetary policy, further increases in credit availability, 
and anticipated improvements in household and busi-
ness confidence.  The average pace of real GDP 
growth was expected to be sufficient to bring the un-
employment rate down very slowly over the projection 
period, and the jobless rate was anticipated to remain 
elevated at the end of 2012. 

Although increases in consumer food and energy prices 
slowed a bit in recent months, the continued step-up in 
core consumer price inflation led the staff to raise 
slightly its projection for core inflation over the coming 
quarters.  However, headline inflation was still expected 
to recede over the medium term, as increases in food 
and energy prices and in non-oil import prices were 
anticipated to ease further.  As in previous forecasts, 
the staff continued to project that core consumer price 
inflation would remain relatively subdued over the pro-
jection period, reflecting both stable long-term inflation 
expectations and persistent slack in labor and product 
markets. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting 
participants—the five members of the Board of Gov-
ernors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve 
Banks—provided projections of output growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 
2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.  Longer-
run projections represent each participant’s assessment 
of the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  
Participants’ forecasts are described in the Summary of 
Economic Projections, which is attached as an adden-
dum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants agreed that the economic 
information received during the intermeeting period 
indicated that the economic recovery was continuing at 
a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than 
they had anticipated at the time of the April meeting.  
Participants noted several transitory factors that were 

restraining growth, including the global supply chain 
disruptions in the wake of the Japanese earthquake, the 
unusually severe weather in some parts of the United 
States, a drop in defense spending, and the effects of 
increases in oil and other commodity prices this year on 
household purchasing power and spending.  Partici-
pants expected that the expansion would gain strength 
as the influence of these temporary factors waned. 

Nonetheless, most participants judged that the pace of 
the economic recovery was likely to be somewhat slow-
er over coming quarters than they had projected in 
April.  This judgment reflected the persistent weakness 
in the housing market, the ongoing efforts by some 
households to reduce debt burdens, the recent sluggish 
growth of income and consumption, the fiscal contrac-
tion at all levels of government, and the effects of un-
certainty regarding the economic outlook and future 
tax and regulatory policies on the willingness of firms 
to hire and invest.  Moreover, the recovery remained 
subject to some downside risks, such as the possibility 
of a more extended period of weak activity and declin-
ing prices in the housing sector, the chance of a larger-
than-expected near-term fiscal tightening, and potential 
financial and economic spillovers if the situation in pe-
ripheral Europe were to deteriorate further.  Partici-
pants still projected that the unemployment rate would 
decline gradually toward levels they saw as consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate, but at a more   
gradual pace than they had forecast in April.  While 
higher prices for energy and other commodities had 
boosted inflation this year, with commodity prices ex-
pected to change little going forward and longer-term 
inflation expectations stable, most participants antic-
ipated that inflation would subside to levels at or below 
those consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. 

Activity in the business sector appeared to have slowed 
somewhat over the intermeeting period. Although the 
effects of the Japanese disaster on U.S. motor vehicle 
production accounted for much of the deceleration in 
industrial production since March, the most recent 
readings from various regional manufacturing surveys 
suggested a slowing in the pace of manufacturing activ-
ity more broadly.  However, business contacts in some 
sectors—most notably energy and high tech—reported 
that activity and business sentiment had strengthened 
further in recent months.  Business investment in 
equipment and software generally remained robust, but 
growth in new orders for nondefense capital goods—
though volatile from month to month—appeared to 
have slowed.  While FOMC participants expected a 
rebound in investment in motor vehicles to boost capi-

tal outlays in coming months, some also noted that 
indicators of current and planned business investment 
in equipment and software had weakened somewhat, 
and surveys showed some deterioration in business 
sentiment.  Business contacts in some regions reported 
that they were reducing capital budgets in response to 
the less certain economic outlook, but in other parts of 
the country, contacts noted that business sentiment 
remained on a firm footing, supported in part by strong 
export demand.  Compared with the relatively robust 
outlook for the business sector, meeting participants 
noted that the housing sector, including residential con-
struction and home sales, remained depressed.  Despite 
efforts aimed at mitigation, foreclosures continued to 
add to the already very large inventory of vacant 
homes, putting downward pressure on home prices and 
housing construction. 

Meeting participants generally noted that the most re-
cent data on employment had been disappointing, and 
new claims for unemployment insurance remained ele-
vated.  The recent deterioration in labor market condi-
tions was a particular concern for FOMC participants 
because the prospects for job growth were seen as an 
important source of uncertainty in the economic out-
look, particularly in the outlook for consumer spend-
ing.  Several participants reported feedback from busi-
ness contacts who were delaying hiring until the eco-
nomic and regulatory outlook became more certain and 
who indicated that they expected to meet any near-term 
increase in the demand for their products without 
boosting employment; these participants noted the risk 
that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow 
the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.  
Wage gains were generally reported to be subdued, al-
though wages for a few skilled job categories in which 
workers were in short supply were said to be increasing 
relatively more rapidly. 

Changes in financial market conditions since the April 
meeting suggested that investors had become more 
concerned about risk.  Equity markets had seen a broad 
selloff, and risk spreads for many corporate borrowers 
had widened noticeably.  Large businesses that have 
access to capital markets continued to enjoy ready 
access to credit—including syndicated loans—on rela-
tively attractive terms; however, credit conditions re-
mained tight for smaller, bank-dependent firms.  Bank-
ers again reported gradual improvements in credit qual-
ity and generally weak loan demand.  In identifying 
possible risks to financial stability, a few participants 
expressed concern that credit conditions in some sec-
tors—most notably the agriculture sector—might have 

eased too much amid signs that investors in these mar-
kets were aggressively taking on more leverage and risk 
in order to obtain higher returns.  Meeting participants 
also noted that an escalation of the fiscal difficulties in 
Greece and spreading concerns about other peripheral 
European countries could cause significant financial 
strains in the United States.  It was pointed out that 
some U.S. money market mutual funds have significant 
exposures to financial institutions from core European 
countries, which, in turn, have substantial exposures to 
Greek sovereign debt.  Participants were also con-
cerned about the possible effect on financial markets of 
a failure to raise the statutory federal debt ceiling in a 
timely manner.  While admitting that it was difficult to 
know what the precise effects of such a development 
would be, participants emphasized that even a short 
delay in the payment of principal or interest on the 
Treasury Department’s debt obligations would likely 
cause severe market disruptions and could also have a 
lasting effect on U.S. borrowing costs. 

Participants noted several factors that had contributed 
to the increase in inflation this year.  The run-up in 
energy prices, as well as an increase in prices of other 
commodities and imported goods, had boosted both 
headline and core inflation.  At same time, extremely 
low motor vehicle inventories resulting from global 
supply disruptions in the wake of the Japanese earth-
quake—by contributing to higher motor vehicle pric-
es—had significantly raised inflation, although partici-
pants anticipated that these temporary pressures would 
lessen as motor vehicle inventories were rebuilt.  Partic-
ipants also observed that crude oil prices fell over the 
intermeeting period and other commodity prices also 
moderated, developments that were likely to damp 
headline inflation at the consumer level going forward.  
However, a number of participants pointed out that the 
recent faster pace of price increases was widespread 
across many categories of spending and was evident in 
inflation measures such as trimmed means or medians, 
which exclude the most extreme price movements in 
each period.  The discussion of core inflation and simi-
lar indicators reflected the view expressed by some par-
ticipants that such measures are useful for forecasting 
the path of inflation over the medium run.  In addition, 
reports from business contacts indicated that some 
already had passed on, or were intending to try to pass 
on, at least a portion of their higher costs to customers 
in order to maintain profit margins.   

Most participants expected that much of the rise in 
headline inflation this year would prove transitory and 
that inflation over the medium term would be subdued

as long as commodity prices did not continue to rise 
rapidly and longer-term inflation expectations remained 
stable.   Nevertheless, a number of participants judged 
the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the up-
side.  Moreover, a few participants saw a continuation 
of the current stance of monetary policy as posing 
some upside risk to inflation expectations and actual 
inflation over time.  However, other participants ob-
served that measures of longer-term inflation compen-
sation derived from financial instruments had remained 
stable of late, and that survey-based measures of    
longer-term inflation expectations also had not changed 
appreciably, on net, in recent months.  These partici-
pants noted that labor costs were rising only slowly, 
and that persistent slack in labor and product markets 
would likely limit upward pressures on prices in coming 
quarters.  Participants agreed that it would be impor-
tant to pay close attention to the evolution of both in-
flation and inflation expectations.  A few participants 
noted that the adoption by the Committee of an explic-
it numerical inflation objective could help keep longer-
term inflation expectations well anchored.  Another 
participant, however, expressed concern that the adop-
tion of such an objective could, in effect, alter the rela-
tive importance of the two components of the Com-
mittee’s dual mandate.     

Participants also discussed the medium-term outlook 
for monetary policy.  Some participants noted that if 
economic growth remained too slow to make satisfac-
tory progress toward reducing the unemployment rate 
and if inflation returned to relatively low levels after the 
effects of recent transitory shocks dissipated, it would 
be appropriate to provide additional monetary policy 
accommodation.  Others, however, saw the recent con-
figuration of slower growth and higher inflation as sug-
gesting that there might be less slack in labor and 
product markets than had been thought.  Several par-
ticipants observed that the necessity of reallocating la-
bor across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as 
the loss of skills caused by high levels of long-term un-
employment and permanent separations, may have 
temporarily reduced the economy’s level of potential 
output.  In that case, the withdrawal of monetary ac-
commodation may need to begin sooner than currently 
anticipated in financial markets.  A few participants 
expressed uncertainty about the efficacy of monetary 
policy in current circumstances but disagreed on the 
implications for future policy.   

Committee Policy Action          
In the discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members agreed that the Committee should 

complete its $600 billion asset purchase program at the 
end of the month and that no changes to the target 
range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this 
meeting.  The information received over the intermeet-
ing period indicated that the economic recovery was 
continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more 
slowly than the Committee had expected, and that the 
labor market was weaker than anticipated.  Inflation 
had increased in recent months as a result of higher 
prices for some commodities, as well as supply chain 
disruptions related to the tragic events in Japan.  None-
theless, members saw the pace of the economic expan-
sion as picking up over the coming quarters and the 
unemployment rate resuming its gradual decline toward 
levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  
Moreover, with longer-term inflation expectations sta-
ble, members expected that inflation would subside to 
levels at or below those consistent with the Commit-
tee’s dual mandate as the effects of past energy and 
other commodity price increases dissipate.  However, 
many members saw the outlook for both employment 
and inflation as unusually uncertain.  Against this back-
drop, members agreed that it was appropriate to main-
tain the Committee’s current policy stance and accumu-
late further information regarding the outlook for 
growth and inflation before deciding on the next policy 
step.  On the one hand, a few members noted that, 
depending on how economic conditions evolve, the 
Committee might have to consider providing additional 
monetary policy stimulus, especially if economic 
growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the 
unemployment rate in the medium run.    On the other 
hand, a few members viewed the increase in inflation 
risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well 
evolve in a way that would warrant the Committee tak-
ing steps to begin removing policy accommodation 
sooner than currently anticipated. 

In the statement to be released following the meeting, 
all members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowl-
edge that the recovery had been slower than the Com-
mittee had expected at the time of the April meeting 
and to note the factors that were currently weighing on 
economic growth and boosting inflation.  The Commit-
tee agreed that the statement should briefly describe its 
current projections for unemployment and inflation 
relative to the levels of those variables that members 
see as consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  
In the discussion of inflation in the statement, mem-
bers decided to reference inflation—meaning overall 
inflation—rather than underlying inflation or inflation 
trends, in order to be clear that the Committee’s objec-

Minutes of the Meeting of June 21-22, 2011 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

tive is the level of overall inflation in the medium term.  
The Committee also decided to reiterate that economic 
conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low le-
vels for the federal funds rate for an extended period; 
in addition, the Committee noted that it would review 
regularly the size and composition of its securities hold-
ings, and that it is prepared to adjust those holdings as 
appropriate. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to complete 
purchases of $600 billion of longer-term 
Treasury securities by the end of this month.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to 
maintain its existing policy of reinvesting 
principal payments on all domestic securities 
in the System Open Market Account in 
Treasury securities in order to maintain the 
total face value of domestic securities at ap-
proximately $2.6 trillion.  The System Open 
Market Account Manager and the Secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongo-
ing developments regarding the System’s bal-
ance sheet that could affect the attainment 
over time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 12:30 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in April indi-
cates that the economic recovery is continu-
ing at a moderate pace, though somewhat 
more slowly than the Committee had ex-
pected.  Also, recent labor market indicators 
have been weaker than anticipated.  The 
slower pace of the recovery reflects in part 
factors that are likely to be temporary, in-
cluding the damping effect of higher food 
and energy prices on consumer purchasing 
power and spending as well as supply chain 

disruptions associated with the tragic events 
in Japan.  Household spending and business 
investment in equipment and software con-
tinue to expand.  However, investment in 
nonresidential structures is still weak, and the 
housing sector continues to be depressed.  
Inflation has picked up in recent months, 
mainly reflecting higher prices for some 
commodities and imported goods, as well as 
the recent supply chain disruptions.  Howev-
er, longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable.  

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  The unem-
ployment rate remains elevated; however, the 
Committee expects the pace of recovery to 
pick up over coming quarters and the unem-
ployment rate to resume its gradual decline 
toward levels that the Committee judges to 
be consistent with its dual mandate.  Infla-
tion has moved up recently, but the Commit-
tee anticipates that inflation will subside to 
levels at or below those consistent with the 
Committee’s dual mandate as the effects of 
past energy and other commodity price in-
creases dissipate.  However, the Committee 
will continue to pay close attention to the 
evolution of inflation and inflation expecta-
tions.   

To promote the ongoing economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with its mandate, the 
Committee decided today to keep the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to         
¼ percent.  The Committee continues to an-
ticipate that economic conditions—including 
low rates of resource utilization and a sub-
dued outlook for inflation over the medium 
run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels for the federal funds rate for an ex-
tended period.  The Committee will com-
plete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-
term Treasury securities by the end of this 
month and will maintain its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its se-
curities holdings.  The Committee will regu-
larly review the size and composition of its 
securities holdings and is prepared to adjust 
those holdings as appropriate.

The Committee will monitor the economic 
outlook and financial developments and will 
act as needed to best foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Richard W. 
Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser, Sar-
ah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yel-
len. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

External Communications 
In follow-up to discussions at the January meeting, the 
Committee turned to consideration of policies aimed at 
supporting effective communication with the public 
regarding the outlook for the economy and monetary 
policy.  The subcommittee on communication, chaired 
by Governor Yellen and composed of Governor Duke 
and Presidents Fisher and Rosengren, proposed poli-
cies for Committee participants and for Federal Re-
serve System staff to follow in their communications 
with  the public  in order to reinforce the  public’s con-

fidence in the transparency and integrity of the mone-
tary policy process.  By unanimous vote, the Commit-
tee approved the policies.2  Participants all supported 
the policies, but several of them emphasized that the 
policy for staff, in particular, should be applied with 
judgment and common sense so as to avoid interfering 
with legitimate research. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday, August 9, 2011.  The meet-
ing adjourned at 12:10 p.m. on June 22, 2011. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on May 17, 2011, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
FOMC meeting held on April 26–27, 2011.

Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the June 21–22, 2011, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the mem-
bers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of 
the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in 
the deliberations of the FOMC, submitted projections 
for growth of real output, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer 
run.  The projections were based on information avail-
able at the time of the meeting and on each partici-
pant’s assumptions about factors likely to affect eco-
nomic outcomes, including his or her assessment of 
appropriate monetary policy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or 
her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices.  
Longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable would be 
expected to converge over time under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks. 

As depicted in figure 1, FOMC participants expected 
the economic recovery to continue at a moderate pace, 
with growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) 
about the same this year as in 2010 and then strength-
ening over 2012 and 2013.  With the pace of economic 
growth modestly exceeding their estimates of the long-
er-run sustainable rate of increase in real GDP, the un-

employment rate is projected to trend gradually lower 
over this projection period.  However, participants an-
ticipated that, at the end of 2013, the unemployment 
rate would still be well above their estimates of the un-
employment rate that they see as consistent, over the 
longer run, with the Committee’s dual mandate of max-
imum employment and price stability.  Most partici-
pants marked up their projections of inflation for 2011 
in light of the increase in inflation in the first half of the 
year, but they projected this increase to be transitory, 
with overall inflation moving back in line with core 
inflation in 2012 and 2013 and remaining at or a bit 
below rates that they see as consistent, over the longer 
run, with the Committee’s dual mandate.  Participants 
generally saw the rate of core inflation as likely to stay 
roughly the same over the next two years as this year. 

On balance, as indicated in table 1, participants antic-
ipated somewhat lower real GDP growth over the near 
term relative to their projections in April but left their 
projections for inflation mostly unchanged since the 
April meeting.  Participants made noticeable downward 
revisions to their projections for GDP growth this year 
and next, but they made little change to their projection 
for 2013 and no change to their longer-run projections.  
Meeting participants revised up their projections for 
the unemployment rate over the forecast period, al-
though they continue to expect a gradual decline in the 
unemployment rate over time.  Participants’ projections

   NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the pre-
vious year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index 
for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the aver-
age civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate 
monetary policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under ap-
propriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The April projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee on April 26–27, 2011.

for overall inflation this year were somewhat more nar-
rowly distributed than in April, and their projections 
for 2012 and 2013 were similar to the projections made 
in April.   

A sizable majority of participants continued to judge 
the level of uncertainty associated with their projections 
for economic growth and inflation as unusually high 
relative to historical norms.  Most participants viewed 
the risks to output growth as being weighted to the 
downside, and none saw those risks as weighted to the 
upside.  Meanwhile, a majority of participants saw the 
risks to overall inflation as balanced. 

The Outlook 
Participants marked down their forecasts for real GDP 
growth in 2011 to reflect the unexpected weakness wit-
nessed in the first half of the year, with the central ten-
dency of their projections moving down to 2.7 to 2.9 
percent from 3.1 to 3.3 percent in April.  Participants 
attributed the downward revision in their growth out-
look to the likely effects of elevated commodity prices 
on real income and consumer sentiment, as well as in-
dications of renewed weakness in the labor market, 
surprisingly sluggish consumer spending, a continued 
lack of recovery in the housing market, supply disrup-
tions from the events in Japan, and constraints on gov-
ernment spending at all levels. 

Looking further ahead, participants’ forecasts for eco-
nomic growth were also marked down in 2012, as par-
ticipants saw some of the weakness in economic activi-
ty this year as likely to persist.  Nevertheless, partici-
pants still anticipated a modest acceleration in econom-
ic output next year, and they expected a further modest 
acceleration in 2013 to growth rates that were largely 
unchanged from their previous projection.  The central 
tendency of their current projections for real GDP 
growth in 2012 was 3.3 to 3.7 percent, compared with 
3.5 to 4.2 percent in April, and in 2013 the central ten-
dency of the projections for real GDP growth was 3.5 
to 4.2 percent.  Participants cited the effects of contin-
ued monetary policy accommodation, some further 
easing in credit market conditions, a waning in the drag 
from elevated commodities prices, and an increase in 
spending from pent-up demand as factors likely to con-
tribute to a pickup in the pace of the expansion.  Partic-
ipants did, however, see a number of factors that would 
likely continue to weigh on GDP growth over the next 
two years.  Most participants pointed to strains in the 
household sector, noting impaired balance sheets, con-
tinued declines in house prices, and persistently high 
unemployment as restraining the growth of consumer 

spending.  In addition, some participants noted that 
although energy and commodity prices were expected 
to stabilize, they would do so at elevated levels and 
would likely continue to damp spending growth for a 
time.  Finally, several participants pointed to a likely 
drag from tighter fiscal policy at all levels of govern-
ment.  In the absence of further shocks, participants 
generally expected that, over time, real GDP growth 
would eventually settle down at an annual rate of 2.5 to 
2.8 percent in the longer run. 

Partly in response to the recent weak indicators of la-
bor demand and participants’ downwardly revised 
views of the economic outlook, participants marked up 
their forecasts for the unemployment rate over the en-
tire forecast period.  For the fourth quarter of this year, 
the central tendency of their projections rose to 8.6 to 
8.9 percent from 8.4 to 8.7 percent in April.  Similar 
upward revisions were made for 2012 and 2013, with 
the central tendencies of the projections for those years 
at 7.8 to 8.2 percent and 7.0 to 7.5 percent, respectively.  
Consistent with their expectations of a moderate re-
covery, with growth only modestly above trend, the 
central tendency of the projections of the unemploy-
ment rate at the end of 2013 was well above the 5.2 to 
5.6 percent central tendency of their estimates of the 
unemployment rate that would prevail over the longer 
run in the absence of further shocks.  The central ten-
dency for the participants’ projections of the unem-
ployment rate in the longer run was unchanged from 
the interval reported in April. 

Participants noted that measures of consumer price 
inflation had increased this year, reflecting in part high-
er prices of oil and other commodities.  However, par-
ticipants’ forecasts for total personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE) inflation in 2011 were little changed 
from April, with the central tendency of their estimates 
narrowing to a range of 2.3 to 2.5 percent, compared 
with 2.1 to 2.8 percent in April.  Most participants an-
ticipated that the influence of higher commodity prices 
and supply disruptions from Japan on inflation would 
be temporary, and that inflation pressures in the future 
would be subdued as commodity prices stabilized, in-
flation expectations remained well anchored, and large 
margins of slack in labor markets kept labor costs in 
check.  As a result, participants anticipated that total 
PCE inflation would step down in 2012 and 2013, with 
the central tendency of their projections in those years 
at 1.5 to 2.0 percent.  The lower end of these central 
tendencies was revised up somewhat from April, sug-
gesting that fewer participants saw a likelihood of very 
low inflation in those years.  The projections for these

two years were at or slightly below the 1.7 to 2.0 per-
cent central tendency of participants’ estimates of the 
longer-run, mandate-consistent rate of inflation.  The 
central tendencies of participants’ projections of core 
PCE inflation this year shifted up a bit to 1.5 to         
1.8 percent, as participants saw some of the run-up in 
commodity prices passing through to core prices.  For 
2012 and 2013, participants saw commodity prices as 
likely to stabilize near current levels, and the central 
tendencies for their forecasts of core inflation were 1.4 
to 2.0 percent, essentially unchanged from their April 
projections. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
A substantial majority of participants continued to 
judge that the levels of uncertainty associated with their 
projections for economic growth and inflation were 
greater than the average levels that had prevailed over 
the past 20 years.1  They pointed to a number of factors 
that contributed to their assessments of the uncertainty 
that they attached to their projections, including the 
severity of the recent recession, the uncertain effects of 
the current stance of monetary policy, uncertainty 
about the direction of fiscal policy, and structural dislo-
cations in the labor market. 

Most participants now judged that the balance of risks 
to economic growth was weighted to the downside, 
and the rest viewed these risks as balanced.  The most 
frequently cited downside risks included a potential for 
a large negative effect on consumer spending from 
higher food and energy prices, a weaker labor market, 
falling house prices, uncertainty from the debate over 
the statutory debt limit and its potential implications 
for near-term fiscal policy, and possible negative finan-
cial market spillovers from European sovereign debt 
problems. The risks surrounding participants’ forecasts 
of the unemployment rate shifted higher, with a slight 
majority of participants now viewing the risks to the 
projection as weighted to the upside, and the rest of the 
participants seeing the risks as broadly balanced. 

Although a majority of participants judged the risks to 
their inflation projections over the period from 2011 to 
2013 to be  weighted to the upside in April,  most parti- 

                                                 
1 Table 2 provides estimates of forecast uncertainty for the 
change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1991 to 2010.  
At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in 
the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to 
assess the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ 
projections.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assump-
tions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for 
real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied 
by the average size of projection errors made in the past. Further infor-
mation is in David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the 
Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting 
Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-60 (Washing-
ton: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November).

cipants now viewed these risks as broadly balanced.  
On the one hand, participants noted that the effect on 
headline inflation of the rise in commodity prices earli-
er this year was likely to subside as those prices stabi-
lized, but they could not rule out the possibility of 
those effects being more persistent than anticipated.  
On the other hand, with the outlook for the economy 
somewhat weaker than previously expected, some par-
ticipants saw a risk that greater resource slack could 
produce more downward pressure on inflation than 
projected.  A few participants noted the possibility that 
the current highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy, if it were to be maintained longer than is appro-
priate, could lead to higher inflation expectations and 
actual inflation. 

Diversity of Views 
Figures 2.A and 2.B provide further details on the di-
versity of participants’ views regarding the likely out-
comes for real GDP growth and the unemployment 
rate in 2011, 2012, 2013, and over the longer run.  The 
dispersion in these projections continued to reflect dif-
ferences in participants’ assessments of many factors, 
including the current degree of underlying momentum 
in economic activity, the outlook for fiscal policy, the 
timing and degree of the recovery of labor markets fol-
lowing the very deep recession, and appropriate future 
monetary policy and its effects on economic activity.  
Regarding participants’ projections for real GDP 
growth, the distribution for this year shifted noticeably 
lower but remained about as concentrated as the distri-
bution in April.  The distribution for 2012 also shifted 
down somewhat and became a bit more concentrated, 
while the distribution for 2013 did not change appreci-

ably.  Regarding participants’ projections for the unem-
ployment rate, the distribution for this year and for 
2012 shifted up relative to the corresponding distribu-
tions in April, and more than one-half of participants 
expected the unemployment rate in 2012 to be in the 
8.0 to 8.1 percent interval.  These shifts reflect the re-
cent softening in labor market conditions along with 
the marking down of expected economic growth this 
year and next.  The distribution of the unemployment 
rate in 2013 also shifted upward somewhat but was 
narrower than the distribution in April.  The distribu-
tions of participants’ estimates of the longer-run 
growth rate of real GDP and of the unemployment rate 
were both little changed from the April projections. 

Corresponding information about the diversity of par-
ticipants’ views regarding the inflation outlook is pro-
vided in figures 2.C and 2.D.  In general, the dispersion 
of participants’ inflation forecasts for the next few 
years represented differences in judgments regarding 
the fundamental determinants of inflation, including 
the degree of resource slack and the extent to which 
such  slack influences  inflation outcomes  and expecta- 

tions, as well as estimates of how the stance of mone-
tary policy may influence inflation expectations.  Re-
garding overall PCE inflation, the distributions for 
2011, 2012, and 2013 all narrowed somewhat, with the 
top of the distributions remaining unchanged but the 
lower end of the distributions moving up somewhat.  
Although participants continued to expect that the 
somewhat elevated rate of inflation this year would 
subside in subsequent years, fewer participants antic-
ipated very low levels of inflation.  The distribution of 
participants’ projections for core inflation for this year 
shifted noticeably higher, reflecting incoming data and 
a view that the pass-through of commodity prices to 
core prices may be greater than previously thought; 
however, the distributions for 2012 and 2013 were little 
changed.  The distribution of participants’ projections 
for overall inflation over the longer run was essentially 
unchanged from its fairly narrow distribution in April, 
reflecting the broad similarity in participants’ assess-
ments of the approximate level of inflation that is con-
sistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of June 21-22, 2011 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

    

 

 
Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-
jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable uncertainty associated 
with economic forecasts.  For example, sup-
pose a participant projects that real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the 
uncertainty attending  those projections is sim- 

ilar to that experienced in the past and the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a  
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP would expand within a range of 2.1 to 3.9 
percent in the current year, 1.4 to 4.6 percent in 
the second year, and 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the 
third year.  The corresponding 70 percent con-
fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 
1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, and 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second and third years. 

Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections.
