Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and 
Communication Practices 
Committee participants began their discussions related 
to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary 
policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.  
Staff briefings provided a retrospective on the Federal 
Reserve’s monetary policy actions since the financial cri-
sis, together with background and analysis regarding 
some key issues.  In its policy response during the reces-
sion and the subsequent economic recovery, the Com-
mittee lowered the federal funds rate to its effective 
lower bound (ELB) and provided additional monetary 
policy accommodation through both forward guidance 
about the expected path of the policy rate and balance 
sheet policy.  These actions eased financial conditions 
and provided substantial support to economic activity; 
they therefore figured importantly in helping promote 
the recovery in the labor market and in preventing infla-
tion from falling substantially below the Committee’s 
objective.  The presentation noted, however, that over 
the past several years, inflation had tended to run mod-
estly below the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 per-
cent, while some indicators of longer-run inflation ex-
pectations currently stood at low levels.  The staff also 
provided results from model simulations that illustrated

possible challenges to the achievement of the Commit-
tee’s dual-mandate goals over the medium term.  These 
challenges included the proximity of the policy rate to 
the ELB, imprecise knowledge about the neutral value 
of the policy rate and the longer-run normal level of the 
unemployment rate, the diminished response of infla-
tion to resource utilization, and uncertainty about the re-
lationship between inflation expectations and inflation 
outcomes. 

In their discussion, participants welcomed the review of 
the monetary policy framework.  They noted that the in-
clusion of feedback from the public as part of the review, 
via the Fed Listens events, had improved the transparency 
of the review process, enhanced the Federal Reserve’s 
public accountability, and provided insights into the pos-
itive implications of strong labor markets and high rates 
of employment for various communities.  Furthermore, 
participants agreed that the review was timely and war-
ranted, in light of the use over the past decade of new 
policy tools and the emergence of changes in the struc-
ture and operation of the U.S. economy.  These changes 
included the long period during which the federal funds 
rate was at the ELB, the probable recurrence of ELB 
episodes if the neutral level of the policy rate remains at 
historically low levels, and the challenges that policymak-
ers face in influencing inflation and inflation expecta-
tions when the response of inflation to resource utiliza-
tion has diminished.  Participants generally agreed that 
the Committee’s consideration of possible modifications 
to its policy strategy, tools, and communication practices 
would take some time and that the process would be 
careful, deliberate, and patient. 

With regard to the current monetary policy framework, 
participants agreed that this framework had served the 
Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past dec-
ade.  They judged that forward guidance and balance 
sheet actions had provided policy accommodation dur-
ing the ELB period and had supported economic activity 
and a return to strong labor market conditions while also 
bringing inflation closer to the Committee’s longer-run 
goal of 2 percent than would otherwise have been the 
case.  In addition, participants noted that the Commit-
tee’s balanced approach to promoting its dual mandate 
of maximum employment and price stability had facili-
tated Committee policy actions aimed at supporting the 
labor market and economic activity even during times 
when the provision of accommodation was potentially 
associated with the risk of inflation running persistently 
above 2 percent.  Participants further observed that such 
inflation risks—along with several of the other perceived 
risks of providing substantial accommodation through 

nontraditional policy tools, including possible adverse 
implications for financial stability—had not been real-
ized.  In particular, a number of participants commented 
that, as many of the potential costs of the Committee’s 
asset purchases had failed to materialize, the Federal Re-
serve might have been able to make use of balance sheet 
tools even more aggressively over the past decade in 
providing appropriate levels of accommodation.  How-
ever, several participants remarked that considerable un-
certainties remained about the costs and efficacy of asset 
purchases, and a couple of participants suggested that, 
taking account of the uncertainties and the perceived 
constraints facing policymakers in the years following 
the recession, the Committee’s decisions on the amount 
of policy accommodation to provide through asset pur-
chases had been appropriate. 

In their discussion of policy tools, participants noted 
that the experience acquired by the Committee with the 
use of forward guidance and asset purchases has led to 
an improved understanding of how these tools operate; 
as a result, the Committee could proceed more confi-
dently and preemptively in using these tools in the future 
if economic circumstances warranted.  Participants dis-
cussed the extent to which forward guidance and balance 
sheet actions could substitute for reductions in the pol-
icy rate when the policy rate is constrained by the ELB.  
Overall, participants judged that the Federal Reserve’s 
ability to provide monetary policy accommodation at the 
ELB through the use of forward guidance and balance 
sheet tools, while helpful in mitigating the effects of the 
constraint on monetary policy arising from the lower 
bound, did not eliminate the risk of protracted periods 
in which  the ELB hinders the conduct of policy.  If pol-
icymakers are not able to provide sufficient accommo-
dation at the ELB through the use of forward guidance 
or balance sheet actions, the constraints posed by the 
ELB could be an impediment to the attainment of the 
Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives over time and 
put at risk the anchoring of inflation expectations at the 
Committee’s longer-run inflation objective. 

Participants looked forward to a detailed discussion over 
coming meetings of alternative strategies for monetary 
policy.  Some participants offered remarks on general 
features of some of the monetary policy strategies that 
they would be discussing and on the relationship be-
tween those strategies and the current framework.  A 
few of the options mentioned were “makeup strategies,” 
in which the realization of inflation below the 2 percent 
objective would give rise to policy actions designed to 
deliver inflation above the objective for a time.  In prin-

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019 Page 3



 

ciple, such makeup strategies could be designed to pro-
mote a 2 percent inflation rate, on average, over some 
period.  In such circumstances, market expectations that 
the central bank would seek to “make up” inflation 
shortfalls following periods during which the ELB was 
binding could help ease overall financial conditions and 
thus help support economic activity during ELB epi-
sodes.  However, many participants noted that the ben-
efits of makeup strategies in supporting economic activ-
ity and stabilizing inflation depended heavily on the pri-
vate sector’s understanding of those strategies and con-
fidence that future policymakers would take actions con-
sistent with those strategies.  A few participants sug-
gested that an alternative means of delivering average in-
flation equal to the Committee’s longer-run objective 
might involve aiming for inflation somewhat in excess 
of 2 percent when the policy rate was away from the 
ELB, recognizing that inflation would tend to move 
lower when the policy rate was constrained by the ELB.  
Another possibility might be for the Committee to ex-
press the inflation goal as a range centered on 2 percent 
and aim to achieve inflation outcomes in the upper end 
of the range in periods when resource utilization was 
high.  A couple of participants noted that an adoption of 
a target range would be consistent with the practice of 
some other central banks.  A few other participants sug-
gested that the adoption of a range could convey a mes-
sage that small deviations of inflation from 2 percent 
were unlikely to give rise to sizable policy responses.  A 
couple of participants expressed concern that if policy-
makers regularly failed to respond appropriately to per-
sistent, relatively small shortfalls of inflation below the 
2 percent longer-run objective, inflation expectations 
and average observed inflation could drift below that ob-
jective. 

Participants also discussed the Committee’s Statement 
on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  
Participants noted that this statement had been helpful 
in articulating and clarifying the Federal Reserve’s ap-
proach to monetary policy.  The Committee first re-
leased this document in January 2012 and had renewed 
it, with a few modifications, every year since then.  On 
the basis of the monetary policy and economic experi-
ence of the past decade, participants cited a number of 
topics that they would likely discuss in detail in their de-
liberations during the review and that might motivate 
possible modifications to the statement.  These topics 
included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence 
of the ELB constraint, the role of inflation expectations 
in monetary policy, the best means of conveying the 
Committee’s balanced approach to monetary policy and 

the symmetry of its inflation goal, the relationship be-
tween the Committee’s strategy and its decisions about 
the settings of its policy tools, the implications of the low 
value of the neutral policy rate and of uncertainty about 
the values of the neutral policy rate and the longer-run 
normal rate of unemployment, the potential benefits and 
costs of unemployment running below its longer-run 
normal rate in conditions of muted inflation pressures, 
and the time frame over which policymakers aimed to 
achieve their dual-mandate goals.  A couple of partici-
pants emphasized the availability to policymakers of 
other communication tools through which the Commit-
tee could elaborate on its policy strategy and the chal-
lenges that monetary policy faced in the current environ-
ment, while also indicating that the Committee retains 
flexibility and optionality to achieve its objectives.  Par-
ticipants highlighted the importance of the Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP) in conveying participants’ 
modal outlooks, with several participants suggesting that 
modifications to the SEP’s format might enhance policy 
communications.  Participants also commented on the 
importance of considering the connections between 
monetary policy and financial stability. 

Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they 
would continue their deliberations on the review of the 
Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 
communication practices.  These additional discussions 
would consider various topics, such as alternative policy 
strategies, options for enhanced use of existing monetary 
policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, po-
tential changes to communication practices, the relation-
ship between monetary policy and financial stability, and 
the distributional effects of monetary policy. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager pro tem discussed developments in finan-
cial markets over the intermeeting period.  Regarding 
market participants’ views about the July FOMC meet-
ing, nearly all respondents from the July Open Market 
Desk surveys of dealers and market participants ex-
pected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the 
federal funds rate, a substantial shift from the June sur-
veys when a significant majority had a modal forecast for 
no change.  Survey responses also suggested that expec-
tations had coalesced around a modal forecast for a total 
of two 25 basis point cuts in the target range in 2019 and 
no change thereafter through year-end 2021.  Regarding 
balance sheet policy, survey respondents that expected a 
rate cut at this meeting were almost evenly split on 
whether the Committee would also choose to end bal-
ance runoff immediately after the meeting or to maintain 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

the existing plan to halt runoff at the end of September.  
Market participants generally judged that a two-month 
change in the timing of the end of the balance sheet run-
off would have only a small effect on the path of the 
balance sheet and thus very little, if any, economic effect.  

Expectations for near-term domestic policy easing had 
occurred against the backdrop of a global shift toward 
more accommodative monetary policy.  Several central 
banks had eased policy over the past month and a num-
ber of others shifted to an easing bias.  Market partici-
pants were particularly attentive to a statement after the 
European Central Bank’s Governing Council meeting 
that was perceived as affirming expectations for further 
easing and additional asset purchases.  These changes to 
the policy outlook in the United States and across a num-
ber of countries appeared to play an important role in 
supporting financial conditions and offsetting some of 
the drag on growth from trade tensions and other risks.   

Somewhat reduced concern among market participants 
about important risks to the global outlook also ap-
peared to support risk asset prices.  Following the G-20 
(Group of Twenty) meeting in late June, fewer Desk 
contacts and respondents to the Desk surveys expected 
a significant escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.  In 
addition, investor sentiment was bolstered by news that 
the Administration and Congress had reached a budget 
and debt ceiling agreement that, if passed, would remove 
another source of risk later this year.  That said, contacts 
recognized that some potentially sizeable downside risks 
remained.  Many survey respondents still viewed U.S.-
China trade risks as skewed to the downside, and many 
Desk contacts judged that the risks of a “no-deal” Brexit 
had increased. 

The manager pro tem next discussed developments in 
money markets and open market operations.  The 
spreads of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and 
the median Eurodollar rate relative to the interest on ex-
cess reserves (IOER) rate had increased some and be-
come more variable over recent months, with a notable 
pickup in daily changes in these spreads since late March.  
Moreover, the range of rates in unsecured markets each 
day had widened.  Market participants pointed to pres-
sures in repurchase agreement (repo) markets as one fac-
tor contributing to the uptick in volatility in unsecured 
rates.  These pressures, in turn, seemed to stem partly 
from elevated dealer inventories of Treasury securities 
and dealers’ associated financing needs.  Market partici-
pants also pointed to lower reserve balances as a factor 
affecting rates in unsecured money market rates.  Over 
the intermeeting period, the level of reserves was little 

changed on net; however, some market participants 
noted the association between the gradual increase in un-
secured rates relative to the IOER rate over recent 
months and the declining level of reserves since System 
Open Market Account (SOMA) redemptions began.  
The level of reserves was expected to decline appreciably 
over coming months, partly reflecting an anticipated siz-
able increase in the Treasury’s balance at the Federal Re-
serve following the agreement on the federal budget and 
debt ceiling. 

The manager pro tem updated the Committee on Desk 
plans to resume CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Secu-
rities Identification Procedures) aggregation of SOMA 
holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency mort-
gage-backed securities (MBS) to reduce administrative 
costs and operational complexity, and the Desk expects 
to release a statement in August with details on the ag-
gregation strategy.   

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the July 30–31 meeting in-
dicated that labor market conditions remained strong 
and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at 
a moderate rate in the second quarter.  Consumer price 
inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in June.  Survey-
based measures of longer-run inflation expectations 
were little changed. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid 
rate, on average, in recent months, supported by a brisk 
gain in June.  The unemployment rate edged up to 
3.7 percent in June but was still at a historically low level.  
The labor force participation rate also moved up some-
what but was close to its average over the previous few 
years, and the employment-to-population ratio stayed 
flat.  The unemployment rates for African Americans 
and Asians declined in June, the rate for whites was un-
changed, and the rate for Hispanics edged up; the unem-
ployment rate for each group was below its level at the 
end of the previous economic expansion, though persis-
tent differentials between these rates remained.  The 
share of workers employed part time for economic rea-
sons in June continued to be below the lows reached in 
late 2007.  The rate of private-sector job openings held 
steady in May, while the rate of quits edged down but 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019 Page 5



 

was still at a high level; the four-week moving average of 
initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits 
through mid-July was near historically low levels.  Aver-
age hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent 
over the 12 months ending in June, somewhat faster 
than a year earlier.  The employment cost index for pri-
vate-sector workers increased 2.6 percent over the 
12 months ending in June, the same as a year earlier.  
(Data on compensation per hour that reflected the re-
cent annual update of the national income and product 
accounts by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) 
were not available at the time of the meeting.) 

Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price 
index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending 
in June.  This increase was slower than a year earlier, as 
core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in 
consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 
1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained be-
low core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined.  
The average monthly change in the core PCE price index 
during the second quarter was faster than in the first 
quarter, suggesting that some of the soft inflation read-
ings early in the year were transitory.  The trimmed mean 
measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or 
near 2 percent in recent months.  The consumer price 
index (CPI) rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending 
in June, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent.  Recent 
survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-
tions were little changed on balance.  The preliminary 
July reading from the University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers moved back up after dipping in June but was 
still at a relatively low level; the measures from the 
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market 
Participants were little changed. 

Real consumer expenditures rose briskly in the second 
quarter after a sluggish gain in the first quarter, sup-
ported in part by a robust pace of light motor vehicle 
sales in May and June.  However, real PCE rose more 
slowly in June than in the first five months of the year, 
suggesting some deceleration in consumer spending go-
ing into the third quarter.  Key factors that influence 
consumer spending—including a low unemployment 
rate, further gains in real disposable income, and ele-
vated measures of households’ net worth—were sup-
portive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  In 
addition, the preliminary July reading on the Michigan 
survey measure of consumer sentiment remained at an 
upbeat level. 

Real residential investment declined again in the second 
quarter.  Although starts of new single-family homes 
rose in June, the average in the second quarter was lower 
than in the first quarter; starts of multifamily units fell 
back in June but rose for the second quarter as a whole.  
Building permit issuance for new single-family homes—
which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying 
trend in construction of such homes—was at roughly 
the same level in June as its first-quarter average.  On net 
in May and June, sales of new homes declined, while 
sales of existing homes rose. 

Real nonresidential private fixed investment edged down 
in the second quarter, as a decline in expenditures on 
nonresidential structures more than offset an increase in 
expenditures for business equipment and intellectual 
property.  Forward-looking indicators of fixed invest-
ment were mixed.  Orders for nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft increased in June, and some measures 
of business sentiment improved.  However, analysts’ ex-
pectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth remained 
soft, trade policy concerns appeared to be weighing on 
investment, and the number of crude oil and natural gas 
rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued 
to decrease in recent weeks. 

Industrial production (IP) was unchanged in June, as a 
decrease in the output of utilities offset increases in the 
output of manufacturers and mines.  For the second 
quarter as a whole, both total IP and manufacturing out-
put declined, while mining output rose notably, sup-
ported by a strong gain in crude oil extraction.  Au-
tomakers’ assembly schedules suggested that production 
of light motor vehicles would move up somewhat in the 
third quarter.  However, new orders indexes from na-
tional and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to-
ward continued softness in manufacturing production in 
coming months.  

Total real government purchases rose solidly in the sec-
ond quarter.  Federal defense spending increased, and 
nondefense purchases returned to more typical levels af-
ter the partial federal government shutdown in the first 
quarter.  Real purchases by state and local governments 
rose moderately, boosted by a strong gain in spending 
on structures and an increase in the payrolls of those 
governments. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in 
May relative to April, as imports increased more than ex-
ports.  In June, preliminary data indicated declining 
nominal goods exports and imports.  Within exports, de-
clines were particularly notable for exports of consumer 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

goods and capital goods, the latter of which had already 
been depressed by the suspension of Boeing 737 MAX 
exports.  All told, the BEA estimates that net exports, 
after adding moderately to first-quarter GDP growth, 
subtracted a similar amount from GDP growth in the 
second quarter on declining exports and flat imports. 

Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign 
economies remained subdued in the second quarter.  In 
several key advanced foreign economies, including the 
euro area, recent indicators pointed to slowing economic 
growth amid continued weakness in manufacturing and 
persistent policy-related uncertainty.  Similarly, in China, 
real GDP growth slowed notably in the second quarter 
after a first-quarter jump.  In contrast, growth in Canada 
and, to a lesser extent, Latin America appeared to pick 
up from a weak first-quarter pace.  Foreign inflation re-
mained muted but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year, 
largely reflecting higher energy prices. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation  
Over the intermeeting period, financial market develop-
ments reflected noticeable shifts in expectations for 
monetary policy in response to Federal Reserve commu-
nications, economic data releases, and trade policy de-
velopments.  Federal Reserve communications were 
generally regarded as more accommodative than had 
been anticipated, exerting downward pressure on 
measures of the expected path for the federal funds rate.  
However, some better-than-expected economic data re-
leases and a slight improvement in the outlook regarding 
trade partially offset these declines.  Yields on nominal 
Treasury securities were little changed on net.  Equity 
prices increased, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and 
inflation compensation rose modestly.  Financing condi-
tions for businesses and households were little changed 
over the intermeeting period and remained generally 
supportive of spending. 

Measures of expectations for near-term domestic mon-
etary policy exhibited notable shifts and reversals over 
the intermeeting period and ended the period little 
changed, on net, with market participants still attaching 
high odds to a 25 basis point reduction in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the July FOMC meet-
ing.  Consistent with significant variation in near-term 
expectations for monetary policy, market-based indica-
tors of interest rate uncertainty for shorter maturities 
over the near term remained somewhat elevated.  Over 
the intermeeting period, market-based expectations for 
the federal funds rate for the end of this year and beyond 
moved down slightly on net.  A straight read of OIS 
(overnight index swap) forward rates implied that the 

federal funds rate would decline about 60 basis points in 
2019 and about 35 basis points in 2020.   

The nominal U.S. Treasury yield curve was little 
changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Both the 
near-term forward spread and the spread between 
10-year and 3-month Treasury yields are still in the bot-
tom decile of their respective distributions since 1971.  
On net, in the weeks following the June FOMC meeting, 
5-year and 5-to-10-year inflation compensation based on 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) moved 
up modestly.  More-accommodative-than-expected Fed-
eral Reserve communications, stronger-than-expected 
inflation data releases, and rising oil prices—amid in-
creased geopolitical tensions with Iran—contributed to 
the upward pressure on inflation compensation.  

Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the in-
termeeting period, with notable increases following the 
June FOMC communications, the Chair’s July Monetary 
Policy Report testimony, and announcements regarding 
trade negotiations following the G-20 meeting.  Addi-
tionally, there was a slight positive reaction to news of 
an agreement on the federal budget and debt limit.  Eq-
uity price increases were broad based across major sec-
tors, with technology, financial, and communication ser-
vices firms outperforming broad indexes.  One-month 
option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the 
VIX—decreased slightly, on net, and corporate credit 
spreads narrowed.  

Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets re-
mained fairly stable.  Overnight interest rates in both un-
secured and secured markets were somewhat elevated 
over the period.  In particular, repo rates were elevated 
on and after the June quarter-end, with the SOFR (Se-
cured Overnight Financing Rate) averaging 8 basis 
points above the IOER rate over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  However, the EFFR remained well within the tar-
get range, averaging 5 basis points above the IOER rate.  
Rates on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of 
deposit declined somewhat.  

Accommodative central bank communications, both in 
the United States and abroad, and some easing of trade 
tensions generally supported foreign risky assets over the 
intermeeting period.  Global equity indexes increased 
modestly, while emerging market sovereign spreads nar-
rowed.  On balance, the broad dollar index ended the 
period modestly lower.  Notably, the British pound de-
preciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, reportedly 
as developments led investors to raise the probability 
they attached to a no-deal Brexit.

Most sovereign long-term bond yields edged lower, on 
net, reflecting firming expectations for further policy ac-
commodation amid growing concerns about the global 
economic outlook.  Italian yields declined notably, in 
part as the government passed some fiscal consolidation 
measures.  The European Central Bank left its policy rate 
unchanged at its July meeting but signaled possible rate 
cuts at coming meetings and said it will explore options 
for additional asset purchases.  Several emerging market 
central banks, including South Korea, Turkey, and Indo-
nesia, lowered policy rates over the period. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re-
mained accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate 
bonds remained robust in June, followed by a typical sea-
sonal decline in July.  Issuance of institutional leveraged 
loans increased notably in May but in June, it returned 
to the more moderate pace observed earlier this year.  
Respondents to the July 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opin-
ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) re-
ported that, on net, banks continued to ease standards 
and terms on commercial and industrial loans to large 
and middle-market firms in the second quarter, with 
many citing aggressive competition as the reason for do-
ing so.  Gross equity issuance has been strong in recent 
months.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations 
continued to show signs of stabilization in June follow-
ing some deterioration earlier in the year.  Credit condi-
tions for both small businesses and municipalities re-
mained accommodative on balance. 

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions remained generally accommodative despite a 
modest deceleration in bank loan growth.  Banks in the 
July SLOOS reported that standards were about un-
changed, on net, in the second quarter for most CRE 
loan categories.  Agency and non-agency commercial 
MBS issuance was strong in the second quarter, as yield 
spreads ticked down. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
remained accommodative over the intermeeting period.  
Mortgage rates were little changed since the June FOMC 
meeting but remained about 1 percentage point below 
their late-2018 level.  These conditions have supported a 
modest increase in home-purchase origination volume 
in recent months.  Refinance originations have risen as 
well but remain near historical lows.  

In consumer credit markets, financing conditions were 
little changed in recent months and remained generally 
supportive of consumer spending.  Growth in consumer 
credit in April and May was up a bit from earlier in the 
year due to a pickup in credit card balances.  Banks in 

the July SLOOS continued to report tightened standards 
for credit cards over the second quarter.  

The staff provided an update on its assessments of po-
tential risks to financial stability.  On balance, the staff 
continued to view vulnerabilities as moderate.  The staff 
judged asset valuation pressures to be notable in a num-
ber of markets, supported in part by the low level of 
Treasury yields.  In assessing vulnerabilities stemming 
from leverage in the household and business sectors, the 
staff noted that business leverage was high while house-
hold leverage was moderate.  The staff viewed the 
buildup in nonfinancial business-sector debt as a factor 
that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector 
and the economy more generally.  Within business debt, 
the staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market, 
the share of new loans to risky borrowers was at a record 
high, and credit extended by private equity firms had 
continued to grow.  At the same time, financial institu-
tions were viewed as resilient, as the risks associated with 
financial leverage and funding risk were still viewed as 
low despite some signs of rising leverage and continued 
inflows into run-prone funds.  Separately, the staff noted 
that market liquidity was, overall, in good shape, al-
though sudden price drops had become more frequent 
in some markets.   

Staff Economic Outlook 
The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by 
the staff for the July FOMC meeting was revised up 
somewhat in the near term, as an upward revision to 
households’ real disposable income in the first half of 
the year led to a slightly higher second-half forecast for 
consumer spending.  Even so, real GDP growth was still 
forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year 
than in the first half, primarily reflecting continued soft 
business investment and a slower increase in govern-
ment spending.  The projection for real GDP growth 
over the medium term was a little stronger, supported by 
the effects of a higher projected path for equity prices 
and a lower trajectory for interest rates.  Real GDP was 
forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s esti-
mate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and 
then slow to a pace slightly below potential output 
growth in 2021.  The unemployment rate was projected 
to be roughly flat through 2021 and to remain below the 
staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate.  With labor 
market conditions judged to be tight, the staff continued 
to assume that projected employment gains would man-
ifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the 
unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward 
pressure on the labor force participation rate.

The staff’s forecast of total PCE price inflation this year 
was revised up a touch, reflecting a slightly higher pro-
jected path for consumer energy prices, while the fore-
cast for core PCE price inflation was unrevised at a level 
below 2 percent.  Both total and core inflation were pro-
jected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings 
early this year were expected to be transitory, but never-
theless to continue to run below 2 percent. 

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of 
the past 20 years.  Moreover, the staff still judged that 
the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted 
to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up-
side for the unemployment rate.  Important factors in 
that assessment were that international trade tensions 
and foreign economic developments seemed more likely 
to move in directions that could have significant nega-
tive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more 
favorably than assumed.  In addition, softness in busi-
ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was 
seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial 
slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  
With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted 
to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection 
were also viewed as having a downward skew. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
Participants agreed that the labor market had remained 
strong over the intermeeting period and that economic 
activity had risen at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been 
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had remained low.  Although growth of 
household spending had picked up from earlier in the 
year, growth of business fixed investment had been soft.  
On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for 
items other than food and energy were running below 
2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations were little changed. 

Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes.  This outlook was 
predicated on financial conditions that were more ac-
commodative than earlier this year.  More accommoda-
tive financial conditions, in turn, partly reflected market 
reaction to the downward adjustment through the 
course of the year in the Committee’s assessment of the 
appropriate path for the target range of the federal funds 

rate in light of weak global economic growth, trade pol-
icy uncertainty, and muted inflation pressures. 

Participants generally noted that incoming data over the 
intermeeting period had been largely positive and that 
the economy had been resilient in the face of ongoing 
global developments.  The economy continued to ex-
pand at a moderate pace, and participants generally ex-
pected GDP growth to slow a bit to around its estimated 
potential rate in the second half of the year.  However, 
participants also observed that global economic growth 
had been disappointing, especially in China and the euro 
area, and that trade policy uncertainty, although waning 
some over the intermeeting period, remained elevated 
and looked likely to persist.  Furthermore, inflation pres-
sures continued to be muted, notwithstanding the firm-
ing in the overall and core PCE price indexes in the three 
months ending in June relative to earlier in the year. 

In their discussion of the business sector, participants 
generally saw uncertainty surrounding trade policy and 
concerns about global growth as continuing to weigh on 
business confidence and firms’ capital expenditure plans.  
Participants generally judged that the risks associated 
with trade uncertainty would remain a persistent head-
wind for the outlook, with a number of participants re-
porting that their business contacts were making deci-
sions based on their view that uncertainties around trade 
were not likely to dissipate anytime soon.  Some partici-
pants observed that trade uncertainties had receded 
somewhat, especially with the easing of trade tensions 
with Mexico and China.  Several participants noted that, 
over the intermeeting period, business sentiment seemed 
to improve a bit and commented that the data for new 
capital goods orders had improved.  Some participants 
expressed the view that the effects of trade uncertainty 
had so far been modest and referenced reports from 
business contacts in their Districts that investment plans 
were continuing, though with a more cautious posture.  

Participants also discussed developments across the 
manufacturing, agriculture, and energy sectors of the 
U.S. economy.  Manufacturing production had declined 
so far this year, dragged down in part by weak real ex-
ports, the ongoing global slowdown, and trade uncer-
tainties.  Several participants noted ongoing challenges 
in the agricultural sector, including those associated with 
increased trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and 
the effects of wet weather and severe flooding.  A couple 
of participants commented on the decline in energy 
prices since last fall and the associated reduction in eco-
nomic activity in the energy sector.

Participants commented on the robust pace of con-
sumer spending.  Noting the important role that house-
hold spending was currently playing in supporting the 
expansion, participants judged that household spending 
would likely continue to be supported by strong labor 
market conditions, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer 
sentiment.  A few participants noted that the continued 
softness in residential investment was a concern, and 
that the expected boost to housing activity from the de-
cline in mortgage rates since last fall had not yet materi-
alized.  In contrast, a couple of participants reported that 
some recent indicators of housing activity in their Dis-
tricts had been somewhat more positive of late.  

In their discussion of the labor market, participants 
judged that conditions remained strong, with the unem-
ployment rate near historical lows and continued solid 
job gains, on average, in recent months.  Job gains in 
June were stronger than expected, following a weak 
reading in May.  Looking ahead, participants expected 
the labor market to remain strong, with the pace of job 
gains slower than last year but above what is estimated 
to be necessary to hold labor utilization steady.  Reports 
from business contacts pointed to continued strong la-
bor demand, with many firms reporting difficulty finding 
workers to meet current demand.  Several participants 
reported seeing notable wage pressures for lower-wage 
workers.  However, participants viewed overall wage 
growth as broadly consistent with the modest average 
rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and, 
consequently, as not exerting much upward pressure on 
inflation.  Several participants remarked that there 
seemed to be little sign of overheating in labor markets, 
citing the combination of muted inflation pressures and 
moderate wage growth.  

Regarding inflation developments, some participants 
stressed that, even with the firming of readings for con-
sumer prices in recent months, both overall and core 
PCE price inflation rates continued to run below the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective; the latest 
reading on the 12-month change in the core PCE price 
index was 1.6 percent.  Furthermore, continued weak-
ness in global economic growth and ongoing trade ten-
sions had the potential to slow U.S. economic activity 
and thus further delay a sustained return of inflation to 
the 2 percent objective.  Many other participants, how-
ever, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with the 
view that the lower readings earlier this year were largely 
transitory, and noted that the trimmed mean measure of 
PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Dallas was running around 2 percent.  A few 
participants noted differences in the behavior of 

measures of cyclical and acyclical components of infla-
tion.  By some estimates, the cyclical component of in-
flation continued to firm; the acyclical component, 
which appeared to be influenced by sectoral and techno-
logical changes, was largely responsible for the low level 
of inflation and not likely to respond much to monetary 
policy actions. 

In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, partici-
pants generally anticipated that with appropriate policy, 
inflation would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  However, market-
based measures of inflation compensation and some sur-
vey measures of consumers’ inflation expectations re-
mained low, although they had moved up some of late.  
A few participants remarked that inflation expectations 
appeared to be reasonably well anchored at levels con-
sistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec-
tive.  However, some participants stressed that the pro-
longed shortfall in inflation from the long-run goal could 
cause inflation expectations to drift down—a develop-
ment that might make it more difficult to achieve the 
Committee’s mandated goals on a sustained basis, espe-
cially in the current environment of global disinflation-
ary pressures.  A couple of participants observed that, 
although some indicators of longer-term inflation expec-
tations, like TIPS-based inflation compensation and the 
Michigan survey measure, had not changed substantially 
this year, on net, they were notably lower than their lev-
els several years ago.    

Participants generally judged that downside risks to the 
outlook for economic activity had diminished somewhat 
since their June meeting.  The strong June employment 
report suggested that the weak May payroll figures were 
not a precursor to a more material slowdown in job 
growth.  The agreement between the United States and 
China to resume negotiations appeared to ease trade ten-
sions somewhat.  In addition, many participants noted 
that the recent agreement on the federal debt ceiling and 
budget appropriations substantially reduced near-term 
fiscal policy uncertainty.  Moreover, the possibility of fa-
vorable outcomes of trade negotiations could be a factor 
that would provide a boost to economic activity in the 
future.  Still, important downside risks persisted.  In par-
ticular, participants were mindful that trade tensions 
were far from settled and that trade uncertainties could 
intensify again.  Continued weakness in global economic 
growth remained a significant downside risk, and some 
participants noted that the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit 
had increased.

In their discussion of financial market developments, 
participants observed that financial conditions remained 
supportive of economic growth, with borrowing rates 
low and stock prices near all-time highs.  Participants ob-
served that current financial conditions appeared to be 
premised importantly on expectations that the Federal 
Reserve would ease policy to help offset the drag on eco-
nomic growth stemming from the weaker global outlook 
and uncertainties associated with international trade as 
well as to provide some insurance to address various 
downside risks.  Participants also discussed the decline 
in yields on longer-term nominal Treasury securities in 
recent months.  A few participants expressed the con-
cern that the inversion of the Treasury yield curve, as 
evidenced by the 10-year yield falling below the 3-month 
yield, had persisted for about two months, which could 
indicate that market participants anticipated weaker eco-
nomic conditions in the future and that the Federal Re-
serve would soon need to lower the federal funds rate 
substantially in response.  The longer-horizon real for-
ward rate implied by TIPS had also declined, suggesting 
that the longer-run normal level of the real federal funds 
rate implicit in market prices was lower. 

Among those participants who commented on financial 
stability, most highlighted recent credit market develop-
ments, the elevated valuations in some asset markets, 
and the high level of nonfinancial corporate indebted-
ness.  Several participants noted that high levels of cor-
porate debt and leveraged lending posed some risks to 
the outlook.  A few participants discussed the fast 
growth of private credit markets—a sector not subject 
to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny and require-
ments that applies in the banking sector—and com-
mented that it was important to monitor this market.  
Several participants observed that valuations in equity 
and corporate bond markets were near all-time highs and 
that CRE valuations were also elevated.  A couple of par-
ticipants noted that the low level of Treasury yields—a 
factor seen as supporting asset prices across a range of 
markets—was a potential source of risk if yields moved 
sharply higher.  However, these participants judged that 
in the near term, such risks were small in light of the 
monetary policy outlooks in the United States and 
abroad and generally subdued inflation.  A few partici-
pants expressed the concern that capital ratios at the 
largest banks had continued to fall at a time when they 
should ideally be rising and that capital ratios were ex-
pected to decline further.  Another view was that finan-
cial stability risks at present are moderate and that the 

largest banks would continue to maintain very substan-
tial capital cushions in light of a range of regulatory re-
quirements, including rigorous stress tests. 

In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this 
meeting, those participants who favored a reduction in 
the target range for the federal funds rate pointed to 
three broad categories of reasons for supporting that ac-
tion.   

 First, while the overall outlook remained favorable, 
there had been signs of deceleration in economic ac-
tivity in recent quarters, particularly in business fixed 
investment and manufacturing.  A pronounced 
slowing in economic growth in overseas econo-
mies—perhaps related in part to developments in, 
and uncertainties surrounding, international trade—
appeared to be an important factor in this decelera-
tion.  More generally, such developments were 
among those that had led most participants over re-
cent quarters to revise down their estimates of the 
policy rate path that would be appropriate to pro-
mote maximum employment and stable prices.   

 Second, a policy easing at this meeting would be a 
prudent step from a risk-management perspective.  
Despite some encouraging signs over the intermeet-
ing period, many of the risks and uncertainties sur-
rounding the economic outlook that had been a 
source of concern in June had remained elevated, 
particularly those associated with the global eco-
nomic outlook and international trade.  On this 
point, a number of participants observed that policy 
authorities in many foreign countries had only lim-
ited policy space to support aggregate demand 
should the downside risks to global economic 
growth be realized.   

 Third, there were concerns about the outlook for in-
flation.  A number of participants observed that 
overall inflation had continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, as had inflation for 
items other than food and energy.  Several of these 
participants commented that the fact that wage pres-
sures had remained only moderate despite the low 
unemployment rate could be a sign that the longer-
run normal level of the unemployment rate is appre-
ciably lower than often assumed.  Participants dis-
cussed indicators for longer-term inflation expecta-
tions and inflation compensation.  A number of 
them concluded that the modest increase in market-
based measures of inflation compensation over the 
intermeeting period likely reflected market partici-
pants’ expectation of more accommodative mone-
tary policy in the near future; others observed that, 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019 Page 11



 

while survey measures of inflation expectations were 
little changed from June, the level of expectations by 
at least some measures was low.  Most participants 
judged that long-term inflation expectations either 
were already below the Committee’s 2 percent goal 
or could decline below the level consistent with that 
goal should there be a continuation of the pattern of 
inflation coming in persistently below 2 percent. 

A couple of participants indicated that they would have 
preferred a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at 
this meeting rather than a 25 basis point reduction.  They 
favored a stronger action to better address the stub-
bornly low inflation rates of the past several years, rec-
ognizing that the apparent low sensitivity of inflation to 
levels of resource utilization meant that a notably 
stronger real economy might be required to speed the 
return of inflation to the Committee’s inflation objec-
tive. 

Several participants favored maintaining the same target 
range at this meeting, judging that the real economy con-
tinued to be in a good place, bolstered by confident con-
sumers, a strong job market, and a low rate of unemploy-
ment.  These participants acknowledged that there were 
lingering risks and uncertainties about the global econ-
omy in general, and about international trade in particu-
lar, but they viewed those risks as having diminished 
over the intermeeting period.  In addition, they viewed 
the news on inflation over the intermeeting period as 
consistent with their forecasts that inflation would move 
up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective at an accepta-
ble pace without an adjustment in policy at this meeting.  
Finally, a few participants expressed concerns that fur-
ther monetary accommodation presented a risk to finan-
cial stability in certain sectors of the economy or that a 
reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at 
this meeting could be misinterpreted as a negative signal 
about the state of the economy. 

Participants also discussed the timing of ending the re-
duction in the Committee’s aggregate securities holdings 
in the SOMA.  Ending the reduction of securities hold-
ings in August had the advantage of avoiding the appear-
ance of inconsistency in continuing to allow the balance 
sheet to run off while simultaneously lowering the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  But ending balance 
sheet reduction earlier than under its previous plan 
posed some risk of fostering the erroneous impression 
that the Committee viewed the balance sheet as an active 
tool of policy.  Because the proposed change would end 
the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings only 

two months earlier than previously indicated, policymak-
ers concluded that there were only small differences be-
tween the two options in their implications for the bal-
ance sheet and thus also in their economic effects. 

In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy 
beyond this meeting, participants generally favored an 
approach in which policy would be guided by incoming 
information and its implications for the economic out-
look and that avoided any appearance of following a pre-
set course.  Most participants viewed a proposed quar-
ter-point policy easing at this meeting as part of a recali-
bration of the stance of policy, or mid-cycle adjustment, 
in response to the evolution of the economic outlook 
over recent months.  A number of participants suggested 
that the nature of many of the risks they judged to be 
weighing on the economy, and the absence of clarity re-
garding when those risks might be resolved, highlighted 
the need for policymakers to remain flexible and focused 
on the implications of incoming data for the outlook.    

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members noted that while there had been some im-
provement in economic conditions over the intermeet-
ing period and the overall outlook remained favorable, 
significant risks and uncertainties attending the outlook 
remained.  In particular, sluggish U.S. business fixed in-
vestment spending and manufacturing output had lin-
gered, suggesting that risks and uncertainties associated 
with weak global economic growth and in international 
trade were weighing on the domestic economy.  Strong 
labor markets and rising incomes continued to support 
the outlook for consumer spending, but modest growth 
in prices and wages suggested that inflation pressures re-
mained muted.  Inflation had continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent symmetric objective.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation moved up 
modestly from the low levels recorded in June, but a por-
tion of this change likely reflected the expectation by 
market participants of additional near-term monetary ac-
commodation.  Survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations were little changed.  On this basis, 
all but two members agreed to lower the target range for 
the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent at this meeting.   

With this adjustment to policy, those members who 
voted for the policy action sought to better position the 
overall stance of policy to help counter the effects on the 
outlook of weak global growth and trade policy uncer-
tainty, insure against any further downside risks from 
those sources, and promote a faster return of inflation 
to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective than 

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

would otherwise be the case.  Those members noted that 
the action taken at this meeting should be viewed as part 
of an ongoing reassessment of the appropriate path of 
the federal funds rate that began in late 2018.  Two mem-
bers preferred to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate.  In explaining their policy views, 
those members noted that economic data collected over 
the intermeeting period had been largely positive and 
that they anticipated continued strong labor markets and 
solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving 
up to the Committee’s 2 percent target.  One member 
also noted that a further easing in policy at a time when 
the economy is very strong and asset prices are elevated 
could have adverse implications for financial stability. 

Members agreed that in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objectives.  They reiterated that this assessment 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments.  
Members generally agreed that it was important to main-
tain optionality in setting the future target range for the 
federal funds rate and, more generally, that near-term ad-
justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro-
priately remain dependent on the implications of incom-
ing information for the economic outlook. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, the Commit-
tee implemented several adjustments in the description 
of the economic situation, including a revision to recog-
nize that market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion “remain low.”  The Committee stated that the re-
duction in the target range for the federal funds rate sup-
ported its view that “sustained expansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective” re-
mained the most likely outcomes, but “uncertainties 
about this outlook remain.”  The phrase “as the Com-
mittee contemplates the future path” of the target range 
for the federal funds rate was added to underscore the 
Committee’s intention to carefully assess incoming in-
formation before deciding on future policy adjustments.  
The statement noted that the Committee would “con-
tinue to monitor the implications of incoming infor-
mation for the economic outlook” and would “act as ap-
propriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor 
market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive.”  Finally, the Committee announced the conclusion 

of the reduction of securities holdings in the SOMA.  
Ending the runoff of securities holdings two months 
earlier than initially planned was seen as having only very 
small effects on the balance sheet, with negligible impli-
cations for the economic outlook, and was helpful in 
simplifying communications regarding the usage of the 
Committee’s policy tools. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective August 1, 2019, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 2 to 2¼ percent, including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per-coun-
terparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

Effective August 1, 2019, the Committee di-
rects the Desk to roll over at auction all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of Treasury securities and to reinvest all 
principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.  Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will be reinvested in 
Treasury securities to roughly match the ma-
turity composition of Treasury securities out-
standing; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.”

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in June indicates that 
the labor market remains strong and that eco-
nomic activity has been rising at a moderate 
rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate has 
remained low.  Although growth of household 
spending has picked up from earlier in the year, 
growth of business fixed investment has been 
soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and 
inflation for items other than food and energy 
are running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remain low; 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations are little changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  In light of the implications 
of global developments for the economic out-
look as well as muted inflation pressures, the 
Committee decided to lower the target range for 
the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent.  This 
action supports the Committee’s view that sus-
tained expansion of economic activity, strong 
labor market conditions, and inflation near the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are 
the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties 
about this outlook remain.  As the Committee 
contemplates the future path of the target range 
for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
monitor the implications of incoming infor-
mation for the economic outlook and will act as 
appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a 
strong labor market and inflation near its sym-
metric 2 percent objective. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 

                                                            
7 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab-
lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed-
eral Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, 
and San Francisco.  This vote also encompassed approval by 
the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2.75 percent 
primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, 
effective on the later of August 1, 2019, and the date such Re-
serve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a 
request.  (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve 

maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments. 

The Committee will conclude the reduction of 
its aggregate securities holdings in the System 
Open Market Account in August, two months 
earlier than previously indicated.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. Wil-
liams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James 
Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. 
Quarles. 

Voting against this action: Esther L. George and Eric 
Rosengren. 

President George dissented because she believed that an 
unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on 
the incoming data and the outlook for economic activity 
over the medium term.  Recognizing risks to the outlook 
from the crosscurrents emanating from trade policy un-
certainty and weaker global activity, President George 
would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data 
point to a materially weaker outlook for the economy. 

President Rosengren dissented because he did not see a 
clear and compelling case for additional accommodation 
at this time given that the unemployment rate stood near 
50-year lows, inflation seemed likely to rise toward the 
Committee’s 2 percent target, and financial stability con-
cerns were elevated, as indicated by near-record equity 
prices and corporate leverage. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the 
target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ per-
cent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to 
lower the interest rate paid on required and excess re-
serve balances to 2.10 percent and voted unanimously to 
approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary 
credit rate to 2.75 percent, effective August 1, 2019.7  

Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, and Kansas City were informed of the Secretary 
of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary 
credit rate of 2.75 percent, effective August 1, 2019.)  A sec-
ond vote of the Board encompassed approval of the establish-
ment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit 
under the existing formulas for computing such rates.

Reinvestment Plans 
The manager pro tem described the Desk’s plans for re-
investments in light of the Committee’s decision to con-
clude the reduction of aggregate securities holdings in 
the SOMA portfolio effective August 1.  In accordance 
with the directive to the Desk, beginning on August 1, 
all principal payments from Treasury securities, agency 
debt, and agency MBS will be reinvested.  Principal pay-
ments from Treasury securities held in the SOMA port-
folio will be reinvested through rollovers in Treasury 
auctions.  The Desk also will reinvest principal payments 
from agency debt and agency MBS securities of up to 
$20 billion per month in Treasury securities in a manner 
that roughly matches the maturity composition of Treas-
ury securities outstanding.  The Desk plans to purchase 
these Treasury securities in the secondary market across 
11 sectors of different maturities and security types ap-
proximately in proportion to the 12-month average of 
the amount outstanding in each sector relative to the to-
tal amount outstanding across sectors, as measured at 
the end of July.  The Desk will continue to reinvest 
agency debt and agency MBS principal payments in ex-
cess of $20 billion per month in agency MBS.  Given the 

Committee’s decision to bring forward the timing of 
these purchases to August, the Desk planned to release 
an operational statement to provide more details on the 
plans for reinvestment operations. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 17–
18, 2019.  The meeting adjourned at 11:15 a.m. on 
July 31, 2019. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on July 9, 2019, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on June 18–19, 2019.
