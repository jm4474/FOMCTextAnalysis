By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for 

Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $4 billion 

to $5 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System 

account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities 

for the period from November 16, 1983 through the close of business 

on December 20, 1983.  

By unanimous vote the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized 

and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions 

in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
that real GNP is growing at a relatively rapid pace in 
the current quarter, although the rate of expansion 
appears to have moderated since the spring and summer.  
In October, industrial production increased appreciably, 
following large gains in previous months. Nonfarm 
payroll employment rose substantially further and the 
civilian unemployment rate declined 1/2 percentage

point to 8.8 percent. After changing little on balance 
during the summer months, retail sales strengthened in 
September and October. Housing starts and permits 
declined in September while home sales rose somewhat.  
Recent data on new orders and shipments indicate 
further strength in the demand for business equipment.  
Producer and consumer prices have continued to 
increase at about the same pace as in other recent 
months. The index of average hourly earnings rose 
somewhat more in September and October than in 
previous months but over the first ten months of 
the year the index has risen more slowly than in 1982.  

The foreign exchange value of the dollar has 
risen since early October against a trade-weighted 
average of major foreign currencies. The U.S. foreign 
trade deficit increased considerably in the third 
quarter, with imports, especially of petroleum, 
rising faster than exports.  

After slowing substantially over the summer 
months, growth in M2 accelerated in October, while 
M3 continued to expand at a moderate rate. Through 
October M2 was at a level in the lower portion of 
the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 in the upper 
portion of its range. M1 continued to grow at a 
sluggish pace in October and was in the lower portion 
of the Committee's monitoring range for the second 
half of the year. Longer-term market rates have 
risen somewhat on balance since early October, and 
short-term rates generally have fluctuated in a narrow 
range.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster 
monetary and financial conditions that will help to 
reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on 
a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable 
pattern of international transactions. At its meeting 
in July the Committee reconsidered the growth ranges 
for monetary and credit aggregates established earlier 
for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives and set 
tentative ranges for 1984. The Committee recognized 
that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate 
economic goals have become less predictable; that the 
impact of new deposit accounts on growth of the 
monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high 
degree of confidence; and that the availability of 

interest on large portions of transaction accounts 
may be reflected in some changes in the historical 
trends in velocity.



11/14-15/83

Against this background, the Committee at its 
July meeting reaffirmed the following growth ranges 
for the broader aggregates: for the period from 
February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 
7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2; and for 
the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the 
fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for 
M3. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth 
ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 
1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 
percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The 
Committee considered that growth of M1 in a range 
of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 
to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 
4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the 
fourth quarter of 1984, would be consistent with the 
ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated 
range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was 
reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and 
tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  

In implementing monetary policy, the Committee 
agreed that substantial weight would continue to be 
placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggre
gates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic non
financial debt will be monitored, with the degree of 
weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence 
that velocity characteristics are resuming more pre
dictable patterns. The Committee understood that 
policy implementation would involve continuing 
appraisal of the relationships between the various 
measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, 
including evaluation of conditions in domestic 
credit and foreign exchange markets.  

The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain 
the existing degree of reserve restraint. The action 
is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and 
M3 at annual rates of around 8-1/2 percent from 
September to December, consistent with the targets 
established for these aggregates for the year.  
Depending on evidence about the continuing strength 
of economic recovery and other factors bearing on 
the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater 
restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates 
expand more rapidly; lesser restraint might be 
acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall



11/14-15/83

in growth of the aggregates from current expectations.  
Given the relatively slow growth in October, the 
Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual 
rate of around 5 to 6 percent from September to 
December will be consistent with its fourth-quarter 
objectives for the broader aggregates, and that 
expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would 
remain within the range established for the year.  
The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if 
it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations 
that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related 
reserve paths during the period before the next 
meeting is likely to be associated with a federal 
funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 
percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on Tuesday, December 20, 1983.  

The meeting adjourned.
