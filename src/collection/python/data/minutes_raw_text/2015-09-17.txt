Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market 
Operations, and Policy Normalization  
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets.  The deputy manager followed 
with a briefing on money market developments and Sys-
tem open market operations conducted by the Open 
Market Desk during the period since the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC) met on July 28–29.  Daily 
take-up in the Desk’s overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations declined somewhat, apart from 
month-ends, likely reflecting some increase in money 
market interest rates.  The deputy manager also dis-
cussed recent test operations of the Term Deposit Facil-
ity and updated the Committee on plans for tests of term 

reverse repurchase agreement operations at the end of 
the third quarter. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account over the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy 
A staff briefing provided background on the macroeco-
nomic effects of alternative approaches to ceasing rein-
vestments of principal on securities held in the SOMA 
after the Committee begins to normalize the stance of 
policy by increasing the target range for the federal funds 
rate.  The briefing presented analysis that was based on 
an assumption that the cessation of reinvestments, once 
implemented, would be permanent.  The briefing sug-
gested that if economic conditions evolved in line with a 
modal outlook, differences in macroeconomic outcomes 
would be minor across approaches that ceased reinvest-
ments soon after initial policy firming or continued rein-
vestments until certain levels of the federal funds rate, 
such as 1 percent or 2 percent, were reached.  As a result, 
the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would be 
only modestly affected.  However, if substantial adverse 
shocks occurred, continuing reinvestment until normal-
ization of the level of the federal funds rate was well un-
der way could help avoid situations that would warrant 
a larger reduction in the federal funds rate than perhaps 
could be accomplished given the constraint posed by the 
effective lower bound to nominal interest rates. 

In the ensuing discussion, participants considered the 
advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches 
to reinvestment.  Participants referred to the Commit-
tee’s statement on Policy Normalization Principles and 
Plans, which indicates that the timing of the cessation or 
phasing out of reinvestments will depend on how eco-
nomic and financial conditions and the economic out-
look evolve.  Several participants emphasized that con-
tinuing reinvestments for some time after the initial pol-
icy firming could help manage potential risks, particu-
larly by reducing the probability that the federal funds 
rate might return to the effective lower bound.  Some 
participants expressed a view that, in contrast to the as-
sumption in the staff analysis, the Committee could 
choose to resume reinvestments if macroeconomic con-
ditions warranted.  At the same time, it was also high-
lighted that a larger balance sheet could entail costs, and 
that the Principles and Plans indicate that, in the longer 
run, the SOMA portfolio should be no larger than nec-

essary to conduct monetary policy efficiently and effec-
tively.  The Committee made no decisions regarding its 
strategy for ceasing or phasing out reinvestments at this 
meeting. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the September 16–17 
meeting suggested that real gross domestic product 
(GDP) was expanding at a moderate pace in the third 
quarter.  Labor market conditions continued to improve, 
but labor compensation gains were modest.  Consumer 
price inflation remained below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent and was restrained by further 
declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices.  
Survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations re-
mained stable, while market-based measures of inflation 
compensation moved lower. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid 
pace in July and August.  The unemployment rate stayed 
at 5.3 percent in July but fell to 5.1 percent in August.  
With the labor force participation rate unchanged over 
this period, the employment-to-population ratio edged 
up.  The share of workers employed part time for eco-
nomic reasons remained elevated.  The rate of private-
sector job openings increased in July and was at a high 
level, while the rates of hiring and quits were little 
changed. 

Industrial production increased, on balance, during July 
and August.  Manufacturing production fell in August 
primarily because of a large drop in the output of motor 
vehicles and parts that reversed a substantial portion of 
its jump in July.  Automakers scheduled further declines 
in assemblies over the remainder of the year, and 
broader indicators of manufacturing production, includ-
ing readings on new orders from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, generally suggested that factory 
output would be little changed over that period.  Mining 
output moved up, on net, in July and August after a steep 
decline in the second quarter. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to be rising at a moderate pace in the third quar-
ter.  The components of the nominal retail sales data 
used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct 
its estimates of PCE increased at a strong rate in July and 
August, and sales of light motor vehicles moved up in 
both months.  Household spending was supported by 
moderate growth in real disposable income in July and a 
wealth-to-income ratio that remained high even after re-
cent declines in equity values.  Consumer sentiment in 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers de-
creased in early September, reportedly in part because of 

the recent decline in stock market prices, but it remained 
above its year-earlier level. 

Activity in the housing sector remained on a gradual up-
ward trend.  Starts of new single-family homes rose fur-
ther early in the third quarter and were slightly above the 
pace of permit issuance.  In the multifamily sector, starts 
fell back after having been temporarily elevated in June.  
Sales of new and existing homes both increased in July. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property products appeared to be rising mod-
erately.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft increased in July, and orders for non-
defense capital goods pointed to modest gains in ship-
ments in the coming months, consistent with recent 
readings from surveys of business conditions.  Real 
spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling 
and mining increased sharply in the second quarter, and 
nominal business expenditures for such structures rose 
further in July.  In contrast, real business spending for 
drilling and mining structures fell steeply in the second 
quarter.  Available indicators of drilling activity, such as 
counts of rigs in operation, suggested spending would 
decline less rapidly in the third quarter. 

Total real government purchases appeared to be declin-
ing slightly in the third quarter.  Federal government pur-
chases likely decreased, as defense spending moved 
down further through August.  State and local govern-
ment purchases seemed to be increasing, on balance, as 
the payrolls of these governments expanded at a faster 
pace in July and August than in the second quarter, while 
their nominal construction expenditures edged down in 
July after a large gain in the second quarter. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in June be-
fore narrowing substantially in July.  Exports rose in July, 
supported by increased shipments of non-aircraft capital 
goods and automobiles, but remained subdued.  In con-
trast, imports declined in July, reversing a June increase, 
as imports of consumer goods fell back. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, edged up over the 12 months ending in July, 
restrained importantly by declines in energy prices.  Core 
PCE prices, which exclude food and energy prices, in-
creased 1¼ percent over the same period, with the in-
crease damped in part by declines in the prices of non-
energy imports.  Over the 12 months ending in August, 
total consumer prices as measured by the consumer 
price index (CPI) edged up, while the core CPI increased 
1¾ percent.  Measures of expected longer-run inflation 
from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey,

the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s 
Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable.  However, 
market-based measures of inflation compensation fell to 
near their historical lows, reportedly in response to the 
recent appreciation of the dollar, the decline in oil prices, 
and readings on realized inflation that were slightly be-
low market expectations. 

Measures of labor compensation rose faster than con-
sumer prices over the past year, but the modest increases 
in compensation were similar to those seen in recent 
years.  Over the four quarters ending in the second quar-
ter, the employment cost index increased nearly 2 per-
cent and compensation per hour in the nonfarm busi-
ness sector rose 2¼ percent.  Over the 12 months end-
ing in August, average hourly earnings for all employees 
increased 2¼ percent. 

Foreign economic growth remained weak in the second 
quarter, held back by contractions in real GDP in Can-
ada, Japan, Brazil, and Taiwan, even as activity continued 
to expand at a moderate pace in the euro area and the 
United Kingdom.  Indicators for the third quarter 
pointed to a slight pickup in the pace of foreign growth, 
particularly as recent data for Canada suggested that 
some of the first-half weakness there was dissipating.  
However, recent indicators for some other countries, 
most notably China, were subdued.  Inflation rates con-
tinued to be quite low in the advanced foreign econo-
mies, and market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation had recently moved down in the euro area and 
Japan.  In contrast, inflation in the emerging market 
economies had risen in recent months as a result of 
higher food prices and widespread currency deprecia-
tion. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Although U.S. economic data releases generally met 
market expectations, domestic financial conditions tight-
ened modestly as concerns about prospects for global 
economic growth, centered on China, prompted an in-
crease in financial market volatility and a deterioration in 
risk sentiment during the intermeeting period.  Stock 
market indexes in most advanced and emerging market 
economies ended the period sharply lower.  Tighter fi-
nancial market conditions and greater volatility contrib-
uted to a reduction of the odds that market participants 
appeared to place on the first increase in the federal 
funds rate occurring at the September FOMC meeting 
and to a flatter expected path for the policy rate thereaf-
ter.  Nevertheless, yields on short- and longer-term nom-
inal Treasury securities were modestly higher than when 
the Committee met in July. 

Over the intermeeting period, the concerns about global 
economic growth and turbulence in financial markets led 
to greater uncertainty among market participants about 
the likely timing of the start of the normalization of the 
stance of U.S. monetary policy.  Based on federal funds 
futures, the probability of a first increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the September meet-
ing fell slightly; the probabilities attached to subsequent 
meetings through January 2016 were generally little 
changed and rose for meetings later that year.  Similarly, 
results from the Desk’s September Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated 
that, on average, respondents pushed out their expected 
timing of the first increase in the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate.  Regarding the most likely meeting date 
for the first rate increase, survey respondents were about 
evenly split between September and December.  Data on 
overnight index swap rates indicated that investors 
marked down the expected path of the federal funds 
rate, on balance, over the intermeeting period. 

Despite the decline in global equity markets and the 
downward shift in the expected path of the federal funds 
rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities moved up 
modestly, with some market participants citing pur-
ported sales of Treasury securities by foreign govern-
ment authorities to finance foreign exchange market in-
tervention as a factor that likely put upward pressure on 
Treasury yields.  Measures of inflation compensation 
based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities fell to 
near their historical lows. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes were highly correlated 
with foreign equity indexes over the intermeeting period 
and posted net declines.  Although concerns about 
global economic growth likely contributed to the de-
clines in domestic equity prices, investors may also have 
reassessed valuations and risk in equity markets.  Do-
mestic equity indexes were quite volatile in late August 
and early September, and one-month-ahead option- 
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index reached levels 
last seen in 2011.  Spreads on 10-year triple-B-rated and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable- 
maturity Treasury securities widened slightly over the in-
termeeting period. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses tight-
ened modestly over the summer.  Corporate bond and 
institutional leveraged loan issuance remained solid 
through July but moderated in August.  The growth of 
commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books slowed 
in July and August; the deceleration was concentrated in 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



banks with greater exposures to oil and gas firms.  Fi-
nancing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained 
broadly available, with CRE loans on banks’ books ex-
panding and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (CMBS) staying robust.  However, spreads on 
investment-grade CMBS widened noticeably in August, 
reportedly a result of heavy issuance as well as the in-
creased volatility in broader financial markets. 

Conditions in the market for residential mortgages con-
tinued to improve slowly, with interest rates on 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages declining slightly.  Bank holdings of 
closed-end residential loans increased modestly, and the 
Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of mortgage 
credit availability edged up further.  However, credit 
availability for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-
to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios re-
mained tight. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally accommodative, and the performance 
of outstanding consumer loans was largely stable.  Credit 
card balances expanded amid gradually easing lending 
standards, and student and auto loans continued to be 
broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime 
credit scores.  Delinquency rates on credit card loans and 
auto loans stayed low through the second quarter, while 
delinquency rates on student loans remained elevated. 

The exchange value of the U.S. dollar rose notably over 
the period against the currencies of most major U.S. 
trading partners.  While the dollar depreciated against 
the euro and the yen, it appreciated against the Canadian 
dollar.  The dollar also strongly appreciated against the 
currencies of most emerging market economies, as most 
Asian currencies weakened against the dollar following a 
depreciation of the Chinese renminbi, and as the curren-
cies of commodity exporters fell along with declining 
commodity prices.  Sovereign yields in the advanced for-
eign economies ended the period roughly unchanged.  
Changes in peripheral euro-area sovereign yield spreads 
were mixed, with Greek sovereign spreads narrowing 
significantly over the period as Greece and the euro area 
finalized Greece’s third bailout package.  In contrast, 
falling commodity prices and concerns about the pace of 
global growth contributed to capital outflows and gen-
erally wider spreads on dollar-denominated debt in 
emerging Asia and Latin America. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
September FOMC meeting was a little weaker, on bal-
ance, than the one prepared for the July FOMC meeting.  
Recent information on real U.S. economic activity was 

generally stronger than expected, but equity prices de-
clined, the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreci-
ated further, and indicators of foreign economic growth 
were generally weak.  The staff left its forecast for real 
GDP growth over the second half of the year little 
changed but lowered its projection for economic growth 
over the next several years.  The staff also further 
trimmed its assumptions for the rates of increase in 
productivity and potential output over the medium term.  
On net, the level of GDP was anticipated to rise above 
its potential next year, and that gap was projected to 
widen gradually over the medium term.  The unemploy-
ment rate was projected to run a little below the staff’s 
estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. 

The staff projected that consumer price inflation would 
move down over the near term by more than in the pre-
vious projection.  Crude oil prices declined further over 
the intermeeting period and were expected to result in 
lower consumer energy prices, and the effects of recent 
dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices were 
anticipated to push down non-oil import prices.  With 
energy prices and non-oil import prices expected to 
begin to increase steadily next year, the staff projected 
that inflation would rise gradually over the next several 
years but would still be slightly below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018.  In-
flation was anticipated to move up to 2 percent thereaf-
ter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed 
to be consistent with the Committee’s objective and 
slack in labor and product markets projected to have 
waned. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its September 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP and 
inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting 
the staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal 
policy was well positioned to help the economy with-
stand substantial adverse shocks.  Consistent with this 
downside risk to aggregate demand and with the further 
adjustments to the staff’s supply-side assumptions, the 
staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemploy-
ment rate as tilted to the upside. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-
flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 16-17, 2015 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



2015 through 2018 and over the longer run, conditional 
on each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary 
policy.  The longer-run projections represent each par-
ticipant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants viewed the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as indicating that 
economic activity was expanding moderately.  Although 
net exports remained soft, household spending and busi-
ness fixed investment were increasing moderately, and 
the housing sector recovered further.  The labor market 
continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining 
unemployment, and labor market indicators showed that 
underutilization of labor resources had diminished since 
early in the year. 

Growth in real GDP over the first half of the year was 
stronger than participants expected when they prepared 
their June forecasts, and the unemployment rate de-
clined somewhat more than anticipated.  Participants 
made only small adjustments to their projections for 
economic activity over the medium term.  They contin-
ued to anticipate that, with appropriate policy accommo-
dation, the pace of expansion of real activity would re-
main somewhat above its longer-run rate over the next 
two years and lead to further improvement in labor mar-
ket conditions.  Most continued to see the risks to real 
activity and unemployment as nearly balanced, but many 
acknowledged that recent global economic and financial 
developments may have increased the downside risks to 
economic activity somewhat. 

Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy 
prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; 
survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
remained stable.  Participants anticipated that recent 
global developments would likely put further downward 
pressure on inflation in the near term; compared with 
their previous forecasts, more now saw the risks to in-
flation as tilted to the downside.  But participants still 
expected that, as the labor market continued to improve 
and the transitory effects of declines in energy and non-
oil import prices dissipated, inflation would rise gradu-
ally toward 2 percent over the medium term. 

Consumer spending was rising at a solid rate after a 
modest increase in the first quarter.  Participants noted 
that ongoing gains in employment and real income were 
providing support for the rise in spending, and this sup-
port was expected to continue going forward.  House-
hold credit performance was also favorable, with delin-
quency rates on credit cards and auto loans low.  The 
available reports from District contacts in the retail and 
auto industries confirmed the recent solid gains in con-
sumer spending.  Contacts were generally optimistic 
about the outlook, although retail sales appeared to be 
softening in a few areas where economic activity was ad-
versely affected by declines in the energy sector and the 
increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. 

Housing activity was improving, with sales and new con-
struction trending higher.  Solid gains in employment 
and favorable mortgage rates were anticipated to con-
tinue to underpin the recovery in housing.  Contacts in 
a number of Districts were upbeat about prospects for 
the sector, citing strengthening sales, rising home prices, 
an upturn in household formations, and reports that 
buyers had accelerated purchases in anticipation of the 
possibility that mortgage rates might move higher in the 
near term.  Multifamily construction was particularly 
strong in a couple of Districts, but in another a shortage 
of lots was constraining builders’ ability to meet strong 
demand for new single-family homes. 

The information on business spending from District 
contacts was mixed.  Nonresidential construction was 
reported to be expanding in a number of regions.  In 
manufacturing, the auto industry remained a bright spot, 
but the appreciation of the dollar was still restraining 
production of goods for export.  Optimism remained 
relatively high according to some District contacts, al-
though a few regional activity surveys noted some cau-
tion related to uncertainty about recent economic devel-
opments abroad.  The weakness in commodity prices 
and the appreciation of the dollar also continued to 
weigh on activity in the energy and agricultural sectors.  
Moreover, the outlook for the energy sector appeared to 
be worsening.  The substantial global supply of crude oil 
seemed likely to maintain downward pressure on energy 
prices for some time, leading to a deterioration in credit 
conditions for some U.S. producers and a further reduc-
tion in their capital outlays. 

Participants agreed that labor market conditions had im-
proved considerably since earlier in the year.  Payroll em-
ployment had been increasing steadily.  Underutilization 
of labor resources had diminished along a number of di-
mensions:  The unemployment rate had fallen to a level 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



close to most participants’ estimates of its longer-run 
normal rate, and the numbers of discouraged workers 
and those employed part time for economic reasons had 
moved lower.  With the cumulative improvement in la-
bor market conditions, most participants thought that 
the underutilization of labor resources had been sub-
stantially reduced, and a few of them expressed the view 
that underutilization had been eliminated.  But some 
others believed that labor market slack in addition to that 
measured by the unemployment rate remained and that 
further progress was possible before labor market con-
ditions were fully consistent with the Committee’s ob-
jective of maximum employment.  They pointed out 
that, even recognizing the downward trend in labor force 
participation, the level of the participation rate, particu-
larly for prime-age adults, remained depressed; similarly, 
the number of workers on part-time schedules for eco-
nomic reasons was still elevated.  A number of partici-
pants noted that eliminating slack along such broader di-
mensions might require a temporary decline in the un-
employment rate below its longer-run normal level, and 
that this development could speed the return of inflation 
to 2 percent. 

The incoming information on wages and labor compen-
sation, including an especially low reading on the em-
ployment cost index for the second quarter, showed no 
broad-based acceleration.  To some, the continued sub-
dued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of up-
ward pressure on inflation from current levels of labor 
utilization.  Several others, however, noted that weak 
productivity growth and low price inflation might be 
contributing to modest wage increases.  A number of 
participants reported that some of their business con-
tacts were experiencing labor shortages in various occu-
pations and geographic areas resulting in upward pres-
sure on wages, with a few indicating that the pickup in 
wages had become more widespread. 

Recent readings on headline consumer price inflation re-
flected only small increases in core inflation and renewed 
weakness in consumer energy prices.  As a result, the 
12-month changes in both the total and core PCE price 
indexes for August were expected to still be well below 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Participants con-
tinued to judge that a significant portion of the shortfall 
was the result of the transitory effects of declines in 
prices of oil and non-energy commodities.  A few par-
ticipants pointed out that since January when the steep 
drop in energy prices ended, core PCE prices had risen 
at an annual rate of 1.7 percent, closer to the Commit-
tee’s objective, despite the continued decline in prices of 

non-energy imports.  Still, almost all participants antici-
pated that inflation would continue to run below 2 per-
cent in the near term, particularly in light of the further 
decline in oil prices and further appreciation of the dollar 
over the intermeeting period.  Participants also discussed 
various measures of expectations for inflation over the 
longer run.  Surveys continued to show stable longer-run 
inflation expectations, and most participants continued 
to anticipate that longer-run inflation expectations 
would remain well anchored.  A few participants ex-
pressed some concern about the decline in market-based 
measures of inflation compensation.  However, it was 
noted that the decline seemed to be related to the further 
drop in oil prices or may importantly reflect shifts in risk 
and liquidity premiums, and thus may not signal addi-
tional broad and persistent downward price pressures. 

Participants discussed the potential implications of re-
cent economic and financial developments abroad for 
U.S. economic activity and inflation.  A material slow-
down in economic growth in China and potential ad-
verse spillovers to other economies were likely to de-
press U.S. net exports to some extent.  In addition, con-
cerns associated with developments in China and other 
emerging market economies had contributed to a further 
appreciation of the dollar and declines in prices of oil 
and other commodities, which were likely to hold down 
U.S. consumer price inflation in the near term.  In the 
United States, equity prices fell, on balance, amid signif-
icant volatility, and risk spreads for businesses widened.  
Many participants judged that the effects of these devel-
opments on domestic economic activity were likely to be 
small, but they acknowledged the risk that they might 
restrain U.S. economic growth somewhat.  In particular, 
the appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 was still a 
substantial drag on net exports, and the further rise in 
the dollar over the intermeeting period could augment 
the restraint on U.S. net exports.  Some participants 
commented that the recent decline in equity prices 
needed to be viewed in the context of overall valuation 
levels, which they saw as relatively high, and a couple 
noted that volatility had begun to subside. 

During their discussion of economic conditions and 
monetary policy, participants indicated that they did not 
see the changes in asset prices during the intermeeting 
period as bearing significantly on their policy choice ex-
cept insofar as they affected the outlook for achieving 
the Committee’s macroeconomic objectives and the 
risks associated with that outlook.  Many of them saw 
the likely effects of recent developments on the path of 
economic activity and inflation as small or transitory.  
Most participants continued to anticipate that, based on 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 16-17, 2015 Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________



their assessment of current economic conditions and 
their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, 
and inflation, the conditions for policy firming had been 
met or would likely be met by the end of the year.  How-
ever, some participants judged that the downside risks to 
the outlook for economic growth and inflation had in-
creased.  In their view, although the time for policy nor-
malization might be near, it would be appropriate to wait 
for information, including evidence of further improve-
ment in the labor market, confirming that the outlook 
for economic growth had not deteriorated significantly 
and that inflation was still on a path to return to 2 per-
cent over the medium term.  A few mentioned that a 
pickup in wage increases could bolster their confidence 
that resource utilization had tightened sufficiently to 
help move inflation toward the Committee’s objective, 
but they did not view an acceleration in wages as a nec-
essary condition for gaining such confidence. 

Participants weighed a number of risks associated with 
the timing of policy firming.  Some participants were 
concerned that the downside risks to inflation could be 
realized if the target range for the federal funds rate was 
increased before it was clear that economic growth 
would remain at an above-trend pace and downward 
pressures on inflation had abated.  They also worried 
that such a premature tightening might erode the credi-
bility of the Committee’s inflation objective if inflation 
stayed at a rate below 2 percent for a prolonged period.  
It was noted that monetary policy was better positioned 
to respond effectively to unanticipated upside inflation 
surprises than to persistent below-objective inflation, 
particularly when the federal funds rate was still near its 
effective lower bound.  Such considerations also argued 
for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate 
gradually after policy normalization was under way.  
Some other participants, however, expressed concerns 
about delaying the start of normalizing the target range 
for the federal funds rate much longer.  For example, a 
significant delay risked an undesired buildup of inflation-
ary pressures or economic and financial imbalances that 
would be costly to unwind and that eventually could 
have adverse consequences for economic growth.  In ad-
dition, a prompt decision to firm policy could provide a 
signal of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy 
that might spur rather than restrain economic activity.  
These participants preferred to begin policy firming 
soon, with most of them expecting that beginning the 
process before long would allow the target range for the 
federal funds rate to be increased gradually. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity 
was expanding at a moderate pace.  Although net ex-
ports remained soft, economic growth was broadly 
based.  Members noted that recent global and financial 
market developments might restrain economic activity 
somewhat as a result of the higher level of the dollar and 
possible effects of slower economic growth in China and 
in a number of emerging market and commodity- 
producing economies.  Nevertheless, they still viewed 
the risks to U.S. economic activity as nearly balanced, 
and they continued to expect that, with appropriate pol-
icy accommodation, economic activity would most likely 
continue to expand at a moderate pace. 

Members agreed that labor market conditions had im-
proved considerably since earlier in the year, with ongo-
ing solid gains in payroll employment and the unemploy-
ment rate falling to a level quite close to their estimates 
of its longer-run normal rate.  Members anticipated that 
economic activity was likely to continue to expand at a 
pace sufficient to lead to a further reduction in underuti-
lization of labor resources.  Headline inflation continued 
to be held down by the effects of declines in energy and 
commodity prices, and the year-over-year increase in 
core PCE inflation remained below the Committee’s ob-
jective.  Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations had remained stable; market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had moved lower.  
Members anticipated that the declines in oil prices and 
the appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting pe-
riod were likely to exert some additional downward pres-
sure on inflation in the near term.  Members expected 
inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the me-
dium term as the labor market improved further and the 
transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices 
dissipated, but they agreed to continue to monitor infla-
tion developments closely. 

In assessing whether economic conditions had im-
proved sufficiently to initiate a firming in the stance of 
policy, many members said that the improvement in la-
bor market conditions met or would soon meet one of 
the Committee’s criteria for beginning policy normaliza-
tion.  But some indicated that their confidence that in-
flation would gradually return to the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term had not increased, 
in large part because recent global economic and finan-
cial developments had imparted some restraint to the 
economic outlook and placed further downward pres-
sure on inflation in the near term.  Most members agreed 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



that their confidence that inflation would move to the 
Committee’s inflation objective would increase if, as ex-
pected, economic activity continued to expand at a mod-
erate rate and labor market conditions improved further.  
Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, 
although several members were concerned about down-
side risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation. 

Other factors important to the Committee’s assessment 
of the inflation outlook were the expectation that the in-
fluences of lower energy and commodity prices on head-
line inflation would abate, as had occurred in previous 
episodes, and that inflation expectations would remain 
stable.  With energy and commodity prices expected to 
stabilize, members’ projections of inflation incorporated 
a step-up in headline inflation next year.  However, sev-
eral members saw a risk that the additional downward 
pressure on inflation from lower oil prices and a higher 
foreign exchange value of the dollar could persist and, as 
a result, delay or diminish the expected upturn in infla-
tion.  And, while survey measures of longer-run inflation 
expectations remained stable, a couple of members ex-
pressed unease with the decline in market-based 
measures of inflation compensation over the intermeet-
ing period. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties 
associated with the outlook, all but one member con-
cluded that, although the U.S. economy had strength-
ened and labor underutilization had diminished, eco-
nomic conditions did not warrant an increase in the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  They 
agreed that developments over the intermeeting period 
had not materially altered the Committee’s economic 
outlook.  Nevertheless, in part because of the risks to the 
outlook for economic activity and inflation, the Com-
mittee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional 
information confirming that the economic outlook had 
not deteriorated and bolstering members’ confidence 
that inflation would gradually move up toward 2 percent 
over the medium term.  One member, however, pre-
ferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 
at this meeting, indicating that the current low level of 
real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of 
current economic conditions. 

The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm 
in its postmeeting statement that the Committee’s deci-
sion about how long to maintain the current target range 
for the federal funds rate would depend on its assess-

ment of actual and expected progress toward its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  
Members agreed that the Committee’s evaluation of pro-
gress on its objectives would take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and in-
flation expectations, and readings on financial and inter-
national developments.  They also agreed to indicate that 
the Committee continued to anticipate that it would be 
appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate when it sees some further improvement in the labor 
market and is reasonably confident that inflation will 
move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  It was noted that the expected path of the federal 
funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial in-
crease, was most important in influencing financial con-
ditions and thus the outlook for the economy and infla-
tion.  The Committee reiterated its expectation that, 
even after employment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some 
time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. 

The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-
ties at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s 
holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, 
should help maintain accommodative financial condi-
tions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 
¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain such conditions.  The Committee 
directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling 
over maturing Treasury securities into new 
issues and its policy of reinvesting principal 
payments on all agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-

backed securities.  The Committee also directs 
the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon 
swap transactions as necessary to facilitate 
settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The 
System Open Market Account manager and the 
secretary will keep the Committee informed of 
ongoing developments regarding the System’s 
balance sheet that could affect the attainment 
over time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in July suggests that 
economic activity is expanding at a moderate 
pace.  Household spending and business fixed 
investment have been increasing moderately, 
and the housing sector has improved further; 
however, net exports have been soft.  The labor 
market continued to improve, with solid job 
gains and declining unemployment.  On bal-
ance, labor market indicators show that un-
derutilization of labor resources has diminished 
since early this year.  Inflation has continued to 
run below the Committee’s longer-run objec-
tive, partly reflecting declines in energy prices 
and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation 
moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations have remained sta-
ble. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  Recent global economic and 
financial developments may restrain economic 
activity somewhat and are likely to put further 
downward pressure on inflation in the near 
term.  Nonetheless, the Committee expects that, 
with appropriate policy accommodation, eco-
nomic activity will expand at a moderate pace, 
with labor market indicators continuing to 
move toward levels the Committee judges con-
sistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee 
continues to see the risks to the outlook for eco-
nomic activity and the labor market as nearly 
balanced but is monitoring developments 
abroad.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near 
its recent low level in the near term but the 

Committee expects inflation to rise gradually to-
ward 2 percent over the medium term as the la-
bor market improves further and the transitory 
effects of declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the Com-
mittee today reaffirmed its view that the current 
0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate remains appropriate.  In determining how 
long to maintain this target range, the Commit-
tee will assess progress—both realized and ex-
pected—toward its objectives of maximum em-
ployment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-
ment will take into account a wide range of in-
formation, including measures of labor market 
conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on financial 
and international developments.  The Commit-
tee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise 
the target range for the federal funds rate when 
it has seen some further improvement in the la-
bor market and is reasonably confident that in-
flation will move back to its 2 percent objective 
over the medium term. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the 
Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accom-
modative financial conditions. 

When the Committee decides to begin to re-
move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-
anced approach consistent with its longer-run 
goals of maximum employment and inflation of 
2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates 
that, even after employment and inflation are 
near mandate-consistent levels, economic con-
ditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the 
target federal funds rate below levels the Com-
mittee views as normal in the longer run.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley Fischer, 
Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome H. Powell, Daniel K. Ta-
rullo, and John C. Williams. 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Voting against this action:  Jeffrey M. Lacker. 

Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that maintain-
ing exceptionally low real interest rates was not appro-
priate for an economy with persistently strong consump-
tion growth and tightening labor markets.  He viewed 
current disinflationary forces as likely to be transitory, 
and was reasonably confident that inflation would move 
toward 2 percent.  In his view, further delay in removing 
monetary policy accommodation would represent a risky 
departure from past patterns of FOMC behavior in re-
sponse to such economic conditions. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 27–28, 

2015.  The meeting adjourned at 10:55 a.m. on 
September 17, 2015. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on August 18, 2015, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on July 28–29, 2015.

Summary of Economic Projections 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 16–17, 2015, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-
ployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for 
each year from 2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.  
Each participant’s projection was based on information 
available at the time of the meeting together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and as-
sumptions about the factors likely to affect economic 
outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each 
participant’s assessment of the value to which each var-
iable would be expected to converge, over time, under 
appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of fur-
ther shocks to the economy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her 
individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices. 

FOMC participants generally expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, economic growth in 2015 
would be at or slightly above their individual estimates 
of the U.S. economy’s longer-run normal growth rate 
and would increase somewhat in 2016 before slowing to 
or toward its longer-run rate in 2017 and 2018 (table 1 
and figure 1).  Most participants projected that the un-
employment rate would decline a bit further over the re-
mainder of 2015 and be at or slightly below their indi-
vidual judgments of its longer-run normal level from 
2016 through 2018.  Participants projected that inflation, 
as measured by the four-quarter change in the price in-
dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
would be very low this year but then would pick up no-
tably next year and rise further in 2017; all participants 
projected that inflation would be at or close to the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective in 2018. 

As shown in figure 2, all but four participants anticipated 
that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target 
range for the federal funds rate in 2015.  Most expected 
that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal 
funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period as 
headwinds to economic growth fade, labor market indi-
cators reach levels consistent with the Committee’s man-
dated objective of maximum employment, and inflation 
moves up to 2 percent.  Most participants continued to 
expect that it would be appropriate for the federal funds 
rate still to be appreciably below its longer-run level in 

2016 and 2017, reflecting the effects of remaining head-
winds along with other factors. 

Most participants viewed the levels of uncertainty asso-
ciated with their outlooks for economic growth and the 
unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average 
level of the past 20 years.  Most also judged the level of 
uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the 
average level of the past 20 years, although a few partic-
ipants viewed it as higher.  In addition, most participants 
continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly bal-
anced, although some viewed the risks to economic 
growth as weighted to the downside and some saw the 
risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.  A few 
more participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted 
to the downside than as balanced, while one judged these 
risks to be tilted to the upside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
Participants generally projected that, conditional on their 
individual assumptions about appropriate monetary pol-
icy, real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 
from 2015 through 2017 at a pace slightly above their 
estimates of its longer-run normal rate, and that real 
GDP growth would then slow in 2018 to a rate at or near 
their individual estimates of the longer-run rate.  Partic-
ipants pointed to a number of factors that they expected 
would contribute to moderate real output growth over 
the next few years, including improving labor market 
conditions, strengthened household and business bal-
ance sheets, the boost to consumer spending from low 
energy prices, diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, 
and still-accommodative monetary policy. 

Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) contributions in June, all participants revised up 
their projections of real GDP growth for 2015, reflecting 
stronger-than-anticipated growth over the first half of 
the year.  Most participants revised down their projec-
tions of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017.  Several 
participants cited slower projected productivity growth 
as a reason for their downward revisions.  The median 
value of participants’ current projections for real GDP 
growth was 2.1 percent in 2015, 2.3 percent in 2016, 
2.2 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018.  Although 
about half of the participants marked down their projec-
tions of real GDP growth in the longer run, the median 
remained at 2.0 percent. 

Most participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would decline a bit further over the remainder of 2015

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under
appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to
1/4 percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In June 2015, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that
the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were, respectively, 15, 2, and 0.
In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1/8 percentage point) of an individual
participant’s judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate
target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

and be at or below their individual judgments of its 
longer-run normal level from 2016 through 2018.  The 
median of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment 
rate in the fourth quarter of each year was 5.0 percent in 
2015 and 4.8 percent from 2016 through 2018.  Com-
pared with the June SEP, participants’ projected paths 
for the unemployment rate generally shifted down some-
what through 2017.  Many participants noted that recent 
data pointing to faster-than-expected improvement in la-
bor market conditions were an important factor under-
lying the downward revisions to their unemployment 
rate forecasts.  All but a few participants revised down 
their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unem-
ployment; as a result, the median estimate edged down 
to 4.9 percent.  Several participants noted that still-sub-
dued wage and price inflation despite the stronger-than-
expected momentum in the labor market suggested a 
lower level of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-
ment than they had thought previously.  A few also men-
tioned research indicating that demographic groups with 
lower average unemployment rates have accounted for 
an increasing fraction of the labor force. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of partici-
pants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in 
the longer run.  The diversity of views across participants 
reflected, in part, their individual assessments of a num-
ber of factors, including the effects of lower oil prices on 
consumer spending and business investment, the extent 
to which dollar appreciation and weaker foreign eco-
nomic growth would affect real activity, the rate at which 
the forces that have been restraining the pace of the eco-
nomic expansion would continue to abate, the degree to 
which ongoing improvements in the labor market would 
support stronger consumption growth, and the appro-
priate path of monetary policy.  Relative to the June SEP, 
the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP 
growth was roughly unchanged through 2016 but was 
somewhat wider in 2017 and the longer run.  The dis-
persion of participants’ projections for the unemploy-
ment rate in the longer run also widened somewhat. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
Compared with the June SEP, almost all participants 
marked down their projections for PCE inflation this 
year, noting that inflation had been running below their 
earlier projections and that further declines in energy 
prices and import prices were putting additional tempo-
rary downward pressure on PCE inflation.  Nearly all 
participants saw PCE inflation picking up in 2016 and 
rising further in 2017, and almost all saw inflation at or 

close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective 
in 2018.  Some participants also marked down their pro-
jections for core PCE inflation from 2015 through 2017, 
although almost all still expected core inflation to rise 
gradually over the projection period and to reach a level 
at or near 2 percent in 2018.  The median values of pro-
jections for PCE inflation were 0.4 percent in 2015, 
1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent 
in 2018, and the median values for core PCE inflation 
were 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent 
in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018.  Factors cited by par-
ticipants as likely to contribute to a rise of inflation to-
ward 2 percent included stable longer-term inflation ex-
pectations, tighter resource utilization, a pickup in wage 
growth, the waning effects of declines in energy prices 
and appreciation of the dollar, and still-accommodative 
monetary policy. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The range of participants’ projections for PCE in-
flation in 2015 widened slightly compared with June, re-
flecting in part differences in participants’ assessments 
of the effects of the declines in energy and import prices 
on the outlook for inflation.  The dispersion for PCE 
inflation for 2016 and 2017 was about unchanged.  Sim-
ilarly, the ranges for core PCE inflation widened slightly 
in 2015 and were unchanged for 2016 and 2017.  The 
distributions for both inflation measures in 2017 and 
2018 were notably more concentrated near the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective than those for 2015 
and 2016. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise 
the target range for the federal funds rate over the pro-
jection period as forces that have been restraining the 
expansion abate and as labor market indicators and in-
flation move toward values the Committee judges con-
sistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.  As shown in 
figure 2, all but four participants anticipated that it would 
be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the 
federal funds rate during 2015.  However, most pro-
jected that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate 
would remain noticeably below their individual estimates 
of its longer-run normal level through 2017.  Most par-
ticipants saw the appropriate level of the federal funds 
rate as close to its longer-run normal level by 2018. 

Most participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would be at or only slightly above their estimates of its 
longer-run normal level at the end of the year in which

they judged the initial increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate would be warranted.  All participants 
projected that inflation would be below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective in that year, but they also saw infla-
tion rising substantially closer to 2 percent in the follow-
ing year. 

Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.  Relative to June, 
the median value of the federal funds rate decreased 
25 basis points at the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017 to 
0.38 percent, 1.38 percent, and 2.63 percent, respec-
tively, and the dispersion of the projections for the fed-
eral funds rate widened from 2015 through 2017. 

Almost all participants judged that it would be appropri-
ate for the federal funds rate to remain noticeably below 
its longer-run normal level over the next two years even 
though the unemployment rate was anticipated to be 
near its mandate-consistent level and most participants 
expected inflation to be close to 2 percent by 2017.  The 
reasons cited for only gradually increasing the federal 
funds rate included an assessment that the headwinds 
that have been holding back the economic expansion 
will continue to exert some restraint on economic activ-
ity, partly because weak activity abroad and the recent 
appreciation of the dollar are likely to continue to damp 
U.S. net exports for some time.  As support for a view 
that accommodative monetary policy would remain ap-
propriate over the next few years, some participants also 
noted their assessment that residual slack in the labor 
market will still be evident in measures of labor utiliza-
tion other than the unemployment rate, or that the risks 
to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of 
the constraints on monetary policy associated with the 
effective lower bound on the federal funds rate.  Most 
participants expected the federal funds rate to be at or 
only slightly below its longer-run normal level by 2018. 

Relative to the June SEP, more than half of the partici-
pants revised down their estimates of the longer-run 
level of the federal funds rate, with a lower assessment

change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1995 through 
2014.  At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncer-
tainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty 
in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to

jections.  

of the economy’s longer-run growth potential generally 
cited as a contributing factor.  The median estimate of 
the longer-run normal federal funds rate declined 25 ba-
sis points from June, and the range moved down from 
3.25 to 4.25 percent to 3.0 to 4.0 percent.  All partici-
pants judged that inflation in the longer run would be 
equal to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, imply-
ing that their individual judgments regarding the appro-
priate longer-run level of the real federal funds rate in 
the absence of further shocks to the economy ranged 
from 1.0 to 2.0 percent. 

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary 
policy were informed by their judgments about the state 
of the economy, including the values of the unemploy-
ment rate and other labor market indicators that would 
be consistent with maximum employment, their esti-
mates of the current extent of slack in the labor market, 
the prospects for inflation to return to the Committee’s 
longer-term objective of 2 percent, the implications of 
international developments for the domestic economy, 
the pace at which headwinds that have been restraining 
economic activity dissipate and underlying momentum 
in the economy strengthens, the desire to minimize po-
tential disruptions in financial markets that could result 
from a steep increase in the target federal funds rate fol-
lowing liftoff, and the risks around the outlook for eco-
nomic activity and inflation.  Some participants also 
mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy 
rules as factors they considered in judging the appropri-
ate path for the federal funds rate. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of 
uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to 
the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  Most 
participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks 
for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, although a 
larger number than in June viewed the risks to real GDP 
growth as weighted to the downside.  Those participants 
who viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited,

for example, a weaker outlook for economic activity 
abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar.  Most 
participants judged the risks to the outlook for the un-
employment rate to be broadly balanced, though more 
participants than in June viewed the risks to the unem-
ployment rate as weighted to the upside. 

As in the June SEP, participants generally agreed that the 
levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation fore-
casts were broadly similar to historical norms.  Many par-
ticipants viewed the risks to their inflation forecast as 
balanced.  However, the risks were seen as tilted to the 
downside by more than half of the participants, an in-
crease since the June SEP.  These participants cited the 
recent declines in market-based measures of inflation 
compensation and commodity prices and the apprecia-
tion of the dollar as factors that could place greater 
downward pressure on prices than anticipated.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the 
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform 
discussions of monetary policy among policy-
makers and can aid public understanding of the 
basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-
tainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relation-
ships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the 
real world, and the future path of the economy 
can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-
ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely eco-
nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-
tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-
ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they oc-
cur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-
tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate 
the considerable uncertainty associated with 
economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that ex-
perienced in the past and the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported in table 2 would imply a probability of 
about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-
pand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the 
current year,  1.1 to 4.9 percent  in  the second 

year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 
0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for 
overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in 
the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second 
year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 
1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year. 

Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, 
participants provide judgments as to whether 
the uncertainty attached to their projections of 
each variable is greater than, smaller than, or 
broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-
certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-
ipants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the up-
side, are weighted to the downside, or are 
broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge 
whether each variable is more likely to be above 
or below their projections of the most likely out-
come.  These judgments about the uncertainty 
and the risks attending each participant’s projec-
tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-
pants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks 
associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of differ-
ent projections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-
certainty arises primarily because each partici-
pant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  
If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected 
manner, then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change 
from that point forward.
