With Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, 

to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the 

following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
continuing expansion in economic activity, though at a 
somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Total 
nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably in 
October, but on balance its growth has been more 
moderate over the past several months, especially in 
the private sector. The civilian unemployment rate 
has remained around 5-1/4 percent. Strike activity 
and other disruptions depressed industrial production 
noticeably in October. Retail sales fell appreciably 
in October, reflecting a sharp drop in purchases of 
motor vehicles, but some upward revisions were made 
for August and September. Housing starts fell further 
in September and for the third quarter as a whole were 
about unchanged from their reduced second-quarter 
average. Indicators of business capital spending 
suggest slower growth after a substantial increase in 
the first half of the year. The nominal U.S. mer
chandise trade deficit widened in August from its July 
rate as non-oil imports increased markedly. Consumer



prices have risen more slowly on balance since 
midyear, partly reflecting sharp reductions in energy 
prices, but the latest data on labor compensation 
suggest no significant change in prevailing trends.  

Most interest rates have declined appreciably 
since the Committee meeting on October 3. In foreign 
exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined 
slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.  

M2 continued to grow fairly briskly in October, 
largely reflecting strength in its M1 and other liquid 
components; thus far this year M2 has expanded at a 
pace somewhat below the midpoint of the Committee's 
annual range. Growth of M3 picked up in October but 
has remained much more restrained than that of M2, as 
assets of thrift institutions and their associated 
funding needs apparently continued to contract; for 
the year to date, M3 has grown at a rate around the 
lower bound of the Committee's annual range.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster price 
stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable 
basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter
national transactions. In furtherance of these 
objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July 
reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February 
for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 
7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth 
quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The 
monitoring range for growth of total domestic non
financial debt also was maintained at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 
percent for the year. For 1990, on a tentative basis, 
the Committee agreed in July to use the same ranges as 
in 1989 for growth in each of the monetary aggregates 
and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to 
the fourth quarter of 1990. The behavior of the 
monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
the light of movements in their velocities, develop
ments in the economy and financial markets, and 
progress toward price level stability.  

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking 
account of progress toward price stability, the 
strength of the business expansion, the behavior of 
the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign 
exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly 
greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser



reserve restraint would be acceptable in the inter
meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions 
are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 
over the period from September through December at 
annual rates of about 7-1/2 and 4-1/2 percent, 
respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee 
consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic 
Operations that reserve conditions during the period 
before the next meeting are likely to be associated 
with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range 
of 7 to 11 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held 

on Monday-Tuesday, December 18-19, 1989.  

The meeting adjourned.

Secretary
