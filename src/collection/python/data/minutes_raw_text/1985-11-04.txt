By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government

With Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 

execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 

domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
that economic activity is continuing to expand at a 
relatively modest pace. In September, total retail 
sales rose considerably further, but the gain was 
boosted by a temporary surge in auto sales that was 
reversed in October. Total nonfarm payroll employment 
increased considerably in October, following a much

11/4-5/85

slower advance in September, and the civilian unemploy
ment rate was unchanged at 7.1 percent. In recent 
months industrial production has increased only slightly 
on balance. Housing starts fell in September, but sales 
of new and existing homes remained at a relatively high 
level on average. Incoming information generally suggests 
a leveling of business capital spending. Merchandise 
trade data for the third quarter indicate that the 
deficit widened slightly, as imports continued to in

crease. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to 
be rising at rates close to or somewhat below those 
recorded earlier in the year.  

M1 appears to have shown little net change in 
October following several months of rapid expansion.  
Largely reflecting the weakness in M1, growth in M2 
and M3 apparently was quite moderate in October.  
Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has 
remained relatively rapid. Most short-term market 
interest rates have changed little on balance since 
the October 1 meeting of the Committee, while long
term rates have declined somewhat. The trade-weighted 
value of the dollar against major foreign currencies 
has dropped slightly further on balance since October 1, 
following a substantial decline after the September 22 
meeting of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank 
Governors of the G-5 countries.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to 
foster monetary and financial conditions that will 
help to reduce inflation further, promote growth 
in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute 
to an improved pattern of international transactions.  
In furtherance of these objectives the Committee 
at the July meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year 
of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent 
for M3. The associated range for total domestic 
nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent.  
With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to 
the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established 
at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range 
takes account of expectations of a return of velocity 
growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp 
decline in velocity during the first half of the year, 
while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty 
regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the 
new range will continue to be reexamined in the light

11/4-5/85

of evidence with respect to economic and financial 
developments including developments in foreign 
exchange markets. More generally, the Committee 
agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the 
upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing 
developments with respect to velocity and provided 
that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  

For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges 
of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter 
of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent 
for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3.  
The associated range for growth in total domestic non
financial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent 
for 1986. With respect to Ml particularly, the Committee 
recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior 
of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the 
target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in 
establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also 
recognized that account would need to be taken of ex
perience with institutional and depository behavior in 
response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation 
early in the year.  

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks generally to maintain 
about the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
positions. This action is expected to be consistent 
with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September 
to December at annual rates of about 6 percent. M1 
growth over the period at an annual rate of around 6 
percent is also anticipated; slower growth for that 
aggregate would be acceptable in the context of 
satisfactory economic performance, given the very 
rapid growth in M1 over the summer. Somewhat greater 
reserve restraint might, and somewhat lesser reserve 
restraint would, be acceptable depending on behavior 
of the aggregates, taking account of appraisals of 
the strength of the business expansion, developments 
in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation.  
and conditions in domestic and international credit 
markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consulta
tion if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations 
that reserve conditions during the period before the 
next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal 
funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 
percent.
