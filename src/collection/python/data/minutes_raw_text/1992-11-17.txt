By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government 

securities and federal agency obligations during the period October 6, 

1992, through November 16, 1992, were ratified.  

By unanimous vote, paragraph l.A of the Authorization for Domestic 

Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion to $11 billion 

the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System Account holdings of U.S.  

government and federal agency securities for the intermeeting period 

through December 22, 1992.  

With Messrs, Jordan, LaWare, and Melzer dissenting, the Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise 

directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 

accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate 
pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment was up slightly 
in October after declining in the previous two months,



and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.4 
percent. Industrial production rose somewhat in 
October. Retail sales increased considerably in 
September and October. There was some strengthening 
in residential construction activity over the summer 
months. Outlays for business equipment have continued 
to increase, and recent data on orders for nondefense 
capital goods point to further growth in the near term; 
expenditures for nonresidential construction have 
remained weak. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
deficit widened somewhat in July-August from its 
average rate in the second quarter. Recent data on 
wages and prices have been mixed but suggest on balance 
a continuing trend toward lower inflation.  

Most interest rates have increased appreciably 
since the Committee meeting on October 6. In foreign 
exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose very 
substantially over the intermeeting period.  

M2 has expanded at a moderate pace since mid
summer, with all of its growth stemming from its Ml 
component, while M3 grew slowly. Through October, both 
aggregates were estimated to have grown at rates a 
little below the lower ends of the ranges established 
by the Committee for the year.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster price sta
bility and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
meeting on June 30-July 1 reaffirmed the ranges it had 
established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 
2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent respectively, 
measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth 
quarter of 1992. The Committee anticipated that 
developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 
could persist in the second half of the year. The 
monitoring range for growth of total domestic non
financial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 
percent for the year. For 1993, the Committee on a 
tentative basis set the same ranges as in 1992 for 
growth of the monetary aggregates and debt measured 
from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter 
of 1993. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
toward price level stability, movements in their 
velocities, and developments in the economy and 
financial markets.



In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period 
from September through December at annual rates of 
about 3-1/2 and 1 percent, respectively.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would 

be held on Monday, December 21, 1992. 30/ 

The meeting adjourned.

3. Secretary's note: Following the meeting, in response to 
requests from several members, Chairman Greenspan changed 
the meeting date to Tuesday, December 22, 1992.
