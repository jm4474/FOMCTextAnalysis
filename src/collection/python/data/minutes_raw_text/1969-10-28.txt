By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Govern

ment securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances 

during the period October 7 through 27, 1969, were approved, rati

fied, and confirmed.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the 

Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 

accordance with the following current economic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
that the pace of expansion in real economic activity was 
sustained in the third quarter by an acceleration of 
inventory investment, which about offset a further 
slackening in growth of private final sales. Slower 
over-all growth is projected for the fourth quarter, 
although some cross-currents have been evident in the 
recent behavior of monthly economic measures. Prices 
and costs are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most 
market interest rates have declined considerably on 
balance from their recent highs, in large part because 
of changing expectations. In the third quarter, aver
age monthly bank credit declined and the money supply 
changed little; in October it appears that bank credit 
is decreasing further on average but that the money 
supply is growing somewhat. In recent weeks the net 
contraction of outstanding large-denomination CD's 
slowed markedly, apparently reflecting mainly an 
increase in foreign official time deposits, but flows 
of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and 
nonbank thrift institutions appear to have remained 
relatively weak. The U.S. foreign trade surplus 
increased further in September, but the deficit in 
the over-all balance of payments was still large on 
the liquidity basis and even larger on the official 
settlements basis. The appreciation of the German 
mark since the end of September, culminating in the 
revaluation of the official parity, has led to a 
partial reversal of speculative flows, and conditions 
in the Euro-dollar market have eased. In light of



10/28/69

the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the 
Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial 
conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary 
pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable 
economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium 
in the country's balance of payments.  

To implement this policy, System open market 
operations until the next meeting of the Committee 
shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the 
prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term 
credit markets; provided, however, that operations 
shall be modified if bank credit appears to be 
deviating significantly from current projections.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market 

Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 25, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
