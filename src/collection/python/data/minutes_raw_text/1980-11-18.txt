11/18/80

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that 
real GNP is recovering further in the fourth quarter from 
the sharp contraction in the second quarter, while prices 
on the average continue to rise rapidly. In October in
dustrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded 
substantially for the third consecutive month, and the un
employment rate remained around 7 percent. The value of 
retail sales changed little, following four months of re
covery. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings 
over the first ten months of 1980 was somewhat more rapid 
than in 1979.  

The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange 
markets on balance has risen further over the past month.  
The U.S. trade deficit was essentially unchanged in 

September, and the rate in the third quarter was sharply 
lower than that in the first half.  

Growth in M-1A and M-1B moderated further in October 
but was still relatively rapid; growth in M-2 accelerated 
slightly, reflecting a pickup in expansion of its non
transactions component. From the fourth quarter of 1979 

to October, growth of M-1A was in the upper part of the 
range set by the Committee for growth over the year ending 

in the fourth quarter of 1980, while growth of M-1B and 
M-2 was somewhat above the upper limits of their ranges.  
Expansion in commercial bank credit was rapid in October, 
although not so rapid as in August and September. Market 

interest rates have risen sharply in recent weeks; average 
rates on new home mortgage commitments have continued upward.  
On November 14 the Board of Governors announced an increase 
in Federal Reserve discount rates from 11 to 12 percent and 
a surcharge of 2 percentage points on frequent borrowing of 
large member banks from Federal Reserve banks.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster 
monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce 
inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to 
a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At 
its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objec
tives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and 
M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter 
of 1980 within ranges of 3 to 6 percent, 4 to 6 percent, 
6 to 9 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively. The 
associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. For 
the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth 
quarter of 1981, the Committee looked toward a reduction 
in the ranges for growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 on the 
order of percentage point from the ranges adopted for 
1980, abstracting from institutional influences affecting 
the behavior of the aggregates. These ranges will be 
reconsidered as conditions warrant.

11/18/80

In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of 

reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, 

and M-2 over the period from September to December at 

annual rates of about 2 percent, 5 percent, and 7-3/4 

percent respectively, or somewhat less, provided that 

in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly 

average federal funds rate remains within a range of 

13 to 17 percent.  

If it appears during the period before the next meeting 

that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent 
with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager 

for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, 
who will then decide whether the situation calls for supple

mentary instructions from the Committee.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held 

on Friday, December 19, 1980, beginning at 9:30 a..m.  

The meeting adjourned.
