AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN 
MARKET OPERATIONS 
(As amended effective January 29, 2019) 
 
OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS  
 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to 
carry out the most recent domestic policy directive 
adopted by the Committee:   

A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that 
are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin-
cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities 
that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by, any agency of the United 
States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu-
rities”) for the System Open Market Account 
(“SOMA”): 

i. As an outright operation with securities dealers 
and foreign and international accounts maintained 
at the Selected Bank:  on a same-day or deferred de-
livery basis (including such transactions as are com-
monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) 
at market prices; or 
ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or 
deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se-
curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo 
transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub-
ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo 
transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, 
at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the 
Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, 
after applying reasonable limitations on the volume 
of agreements with individual counterparties; 

B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma-
ture without replacement;  
C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection 
with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in 
the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible 
Securities that are direct obligations of the United 
States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the United States; and 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019 Page 3



D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible 
Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United 
States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct 
obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed 
as to principal and interest by that agency. 

 
SECURITIES LENDING 
 
2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se-
lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu-
rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis 
(except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi-
ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). 

A. Such securities lending must be: 
i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; 
ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the 
objectives of the program; 
iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total 
amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that 
may be auctioned; and 
iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the 
amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower 
may borrow. 

B. The Selected Bank may: 
i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis-
cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a 
single issue;  
ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral 
for any loan of securities authorized in this para-
graph 2; and 
iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a 
loan of agency securities authorized in this para-
graph 2. 
 

OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 
 

3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test-
ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi-
tations: 

A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 
shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-
tee; 

B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au-
thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not 
exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and 
C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de-
scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed 
$5 billion at any given time. 

 
TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 
 
4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, while assisting in the provision of 
short-term investments or other authorized services for 
foreign central bank and international accounts main-
tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac-
counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec-
tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the 
Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com-
mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on 
terms comparable to those available in the open market:  

A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake 
reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in 
the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 
65 business days or less; and 
B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus-
tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, 
when appropriate and subject to all other necessary 
authorization and approvals, to:  

i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi-
ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo 
transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus-
tomer Accounts; and  
ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi-
ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. 

Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un-
der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a 
service fee when appropriate.  Transactions undertaken 
with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori-
zation or approval of other entities, including the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when 
involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United 
States Department of the Treasury.

ADDITIONAL MATTERS 
 
5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the 
Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur-
ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to 
instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com-
mittee to: 

A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances 
the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that 
may result in material changes in the composition and 
size of the assets in the SOMA; or  
B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible 
Securities in order to appropriately address temporary 
disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature 
in U.S. dollar funding markets. 

Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of 
this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the 
Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of 
policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s 
long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and 
price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, 
and monetary developments since the most recent meet-
ing of the Committee.  The Chairman, whenever feasi-
ble, will consult with the Committee before making any

tions and the Foreign Currency Directive as shown be-

and sell foreign currencies encompasses purchases and 
sales through standalone spot or forward transactions 
and through foreign exchange swap transactions.  For 
purposes of this Authorization, foreign exchange 
swap transactions are:  swap transactions with the 
United States Treasury (also known as warehousing

banks under reciprocal currency arrangements, swap 
transactions with other central banks under standing

3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or 
forward transactions in foreign currencies:  

A. Approval of such operation is required as fol-
lows: 

i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank 
in advance to execute the operation if it would result 
in the overall volume of standalone spot and for-
ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined 
in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding 
$5 billion since the close of the most recent regular 
meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency 
Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct 
the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera-
tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation 
with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail-
able.  
ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee 
to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the 
operation if it would result in the overall volume of 
standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign

currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au-
thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close

tee.   

B. Such an operation also shall be:   
i. Generally directed at countering disorderly 
market conditions; or 
ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light 
of probable future needs for currencies; or 
iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be 
determined by the Committee.

volume of standalone spot and forward transactions 
in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard-
ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur-
rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the 
transaction. 

 
WAREHOUSING 
 
4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with 
the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re-
quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap 
transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza-
tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve 
Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected 
Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected 
Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known 
as warehousing).  
 
RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, 
AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN 
CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 
 
5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established 
under the North American Framework Agreement, 
standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand-
ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro-
vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary 
to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com-
mittee.

ings must be approved in advance by the Committee 
(or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-
lieves that consultation with the Committee is not fea-
sible in the time available). 
B. For standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements 
all drawings must be approved in advance by the 
Chairman.  The Chairman may approve a schedule of

prove individual drawings that occur according to the 
schedule approved by the Chairman.   
C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar-
rangements all drawings must be approved in advance 
by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the 
Subcommittee believes that consultation with the 
Committee is not feasible in the time available). 
D. Operations involving standing dollar liquidity 
swap arrangements and standing foreign currency li-
quidity swap arrangements shall generally be directed 
at countering strains in financial markets in the United 
States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could 
emerge, so as to mitigate their effects on economic 
and financial conditions in the United States. 
E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing 
dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing for-
eign currency liquidity swap arrangements: 

i. All arrangements are subject to annual review 
and approval by the Committee; 
ii.  Any new arrangements must be approved by 
the Committee; and 
iii. Any changes in the terms of existing arrange-
ments must be approved in advance by the Chair-
man.  The Chairman shall keep the Committee in-
formed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall 
be consistent with principles discussed with and 
guidance provided by the Committee. 

 
OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN 
CURRENCIES 
 
6. Any other operations in foreign currencies for 
which governance is not otherwise specified in this Au-
thorization (such as foreign exchange swap transactions 
with private-sector counterparties) must be authorized 
and directed in advance by the Committee. 
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS 
 
7. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
hold foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-
count in accounts maintained at foreign central banks, 
the Bank for International Settlements, and such other

nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent 
necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of 
the Committee. 

A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of 
foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-

operations as directed by the Committee; 
ii. Secondarily, to maintain a high degree of 
safety; 
iii. Subject to paragraphs 7.A.i and 7.A.ii, to pro-
vide the highest rate of return possible in each cur-
rency; and

thorized by the Committee. 

B. The Selected Bank may manage such foreign cur-
rency holdings by:  

i. Purchasing and selling obligations of, or fully 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign 
government or agency thereof (“Permitted Foreign 
Securities”) through outright purchases and sales; 
ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under 
agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For-
eign Securities and selling such securities under 
agreements for the resale of such securities; and 
iii. Managing balances in various time and other 
deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by 
the Board of Governors under Regulation N.  

C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the 
Committee, may provide additional instructions to the 
Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren-
cies. 

 
ADDITIONAL MATTERS 
 
8. The Committee authorizes the Chairman:   

A. With the prior approval of the Committee, to en-

thorization, and foreign exchange and investment 
transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to 

undertake, from time to time for the purpose of testing 
operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such 
transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar 
year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior 
notice to the Committee.

foreign currency operations for System Open Market 
Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the

Chairman shall promptly report to the Subcommittee 
any action approved by the Chairman pursuant to this 
paragraph. 
12. The Committee authorizes the Chairman, in excep-
tional circumstances where it would not be feasible to 
convene the Committee, to foster the Committee’s ob-
jectives by instructing the Selected Bank to engage in 
foreign currency operations not otherwise authorized 
pursuant to this Authorization.  Any such action shall be 
made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and 
decisions regarding foreign currency operations.  The 
Chairman, whenever feasible, will consult with the Com-
mittee before making any instruction under this para-
graph.

tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 9 of the Authorization. 
 
By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Pro-
gram for Security of FOMC Information. 
 
In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State-
ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat-
egy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was 
required at this meeting, which was to update the refer-
ence to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of 
the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 
4.6 percent to 4.4 percent.  All participants supported 
the statement with the revision, and the Committee 
voted unanimously to approve the updated statement. 
 
STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND 
MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY 
(As amended effective January 29, 2019) 
 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is 
firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from 
the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta-
ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The 
Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci-
sions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity 
facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households 
and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer-
tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, 
and enhances transparency and accountability, which are 
essential in a democratic society.  

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates 
fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan-
cial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions 
tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  
Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions reflect its 
longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as-
sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the 
financial system that could impede the attainment of the 
Committee’s goals.  

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de-
termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee 
has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  
The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at 
the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change 
in the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the 
Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.  The Committee 
would be concerned if inflation were running persis-
tently above or below this objective.  Communicating 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps 
keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, 
thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term 
interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to 
promote maximum employment in the face of signifi-
cant economic disturbances.  The maximum level of em-
ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors 
that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar-
ket.  These factors may change over time and may not 
be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be 
appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; ra-
ther, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed 
by assessments of the maximum level of employment, 
recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer-
tain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a 
wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  
Information about Committee participants’ estimates of 
the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem-
ployment is published four times per year in the 
FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.  For ex-
ample, in the most recent projections, the median of 
FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment was 4.4 percent.  

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to 
mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal 
and deviations of employment from the Committee’s as-
sessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are 
generally complementary.  However, under circum-
stances in which the Committee judges that the objec-
tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap-
proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag-
nitude of the deviations and the potentially different 
time horizons over which employment and inflation are 
projected to return to levels judged consistent with its 
mandate. 

The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and 
to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi-
zational meeting each January. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac-
count (SOMA) provided an overview of developments 
in U.S. and global financial markets.  Financial markets 
were quite volatile over the intermeeting period.  Market 
participants pointed to a number of factors as contrib-
uting to the heightened volatility and sustained declines 
in risk asset prices and interest rates over recent months 
including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for 
foreign economies (particularly for Europe and China), 
perceptions of greater policy risks, and the partial shut-
down of the federal government.  Against this backdrop, 

market participants appeared to interpret FOMC com-
munications at the time of the December meeting as not 
fully appreciating the tightening of financial conditions 
and the associated downside risks to the U.S. economic 
outlook that had emerged since the fall.  In addition, 
some market reports suggested that investors perceived 
the FOMC to be insufficiently flexible in its approach to 
adjusting the path for the federal funds rate or the pro-
cess for balance sheet normalization in light of those 
risks.  The deterioration in risk sentiment late in Decem-
ber was reportedly amplified by poor liquidity and thin 
trading conditions around year-end.   

Early in the new year, market sentiment improved fol-
lowing communications by Federal Reserve officials em-
phasizing that the Committee could be “patient” in con-
sidering further adjustments to the stance of policy and 
that it would be flexible in managing the reduction of 
securities holdings in the SOMA.  On balance, stock 
prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while cor-
porate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the 
changes in these variables since the September FOMC 
meeting. 

The deputy manager reported results from the Open 
Market Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and mar-
ket participants.  Regarding the outlook for policy, the 
median path for the federal funds rate among respond-
ents had shifted down about 25 basis points relative to 
the responses from the surveys conducted ahead of the 
December meeting.  Moreover, the average probability 
that respondents attached to an increase in the target 
range as the next policy action declined and the corre-
sponding probabilities they attached to the possibility 
that the target range would be unchanged or lowered at 
some point this year increased.  Concerning expectations 
for the FOMC statement, many survey respondents an-
ticipated the retention of language pointing to the likeli-
hood of “some further gradual increases” in the target 
range for the federal funds rate but many also expected 
the statement to emphasize patience or data dependence 
in the conduct of policy.  Consistent with recent com-
munications that the FOMC would be flexible in its ap-
proach to balance sheet normalization, the survey results 
also suggested that the respondents anticipated that the 
Committee would slow the balance sheet runoff in sce-
narios that involved a reduction in the target range for 
the federal funds rate. 

In reviewing money market developments, the deputy 
manager noted that federal funds continued to trade at 
rates close to the interest on excess reserves rate.  More-

over, no signs of reserve scarcity were evident in the be-
havior of the federal funds rate; the correlation between 
daily changes in reserve balances and the federal funds 
rate remained close to zero.  In other markets, repur-
chase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year-end, report-
edly reflecting strong demands for financing from deal-
ers associated with large Treasury auction net settle-
ments on that day combined with a cutback in the supply 
of financing available from banks and others managing 
the size of their balance sheets over year-end for report-
ing purposes.  The deputy manager noted that the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of New York was planning to release 
a notice in early February for public comment on plans 
to include new data on selected deposits in the calcula-
tion of the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR).  In ad-
dition, the staff had begun work aimed at publishing a 
series of backward-looking average secured overnight fi-
nancing rates (SOFR) as a further step to support refer-
ence rate reform.  The staff planned to solicit public 
feedback on this effort later this year and initiate publi-
cation of these averages by the first half of 2020. 

Following the briefing, participants raised a number of 
questions about market reports that the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet runoff and associated “quantitative 
tightening” had been an important factor contributing to 
the selloff in equity markets in the closing months of last 
year.  While respondents assessed that the reduction of 
securities held in the SOMA would put some modest 
upward pressure on Treasury yields and agency mort-
gage-backed securities (MBS) yields over time, they gen-
erally placed little weight on balance sheet reduction as a 
prime factor spurring the deterioration in risk sentiment 
over that period.  However, some other investors report-
edly held firmly to the belief that the runoff of the Fed-
eral Reserve’s securities holdings was a factor putting 
significant downward pressure on risky asset prices, and 
the investment decisions of these investors, particularly 
in thin market conditions around the year-end, might 
have had an outsized effect on market prices for a time.  
Participants also discussed the hypothesis that investors 
may have taken some signal about the future path of the 
federal funds rate based on perceptions that the Federal 
Reserve was unwilling to adjust the pace of balance sheet 
runoff in light of economic and financial developments. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation 
Frameworks 
Committee participants resumed their discussion from 
the December 2018 meeting of the appropriate long-run 
framework for monetary policy implementation.  At the 
January meeting, the staff provided briefings on the ef-
fectiveness and efficiency of the Committee’s current 
operating regime and on options for transitioning to the 
longer-run size of the balance sheet. 

The staff noted that the Committee had previously indi-
cated that, in the longer run, it intends to operate with 
no more securities holdings than necessary to implement 
monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  In consider-
ing the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff 
observed that over recent years, the Federal Reserve had 
been able to implement monetary policy in an environ-
ment with ample reserves by adjusting administered 
rates—including the rates on required and excess reserve 
balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse re-
purchase agreement facility—without needing to ac-
tively manage the supply of reserves.  Over this period, 
the effective federal funds rate was generally steady at 
levels well within the Committee’s target range despite 
substantial changes in the level of reserves in the banking 
system and significant changes in money markets, regu-
lations, and financial institutions’ business models.  In 
addition, other money market rates generally moved 
closely with the federal funds rate.  The current regime 
was therefore effective both in providing control of the 
policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy 
stance to other rates and broader financial markets.  

The staff briefing also included a discussion of factors 
relevant in judging the level of reserves that would sup-
port the efficient implementation of monetary policy.  
The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves 
above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat 
portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the 
size and frequency of open market operations needed to 
maintain good control of the policy rate.  The aggregate 
level of reserves had already declined by $1.2 trillion 
from a peak level of $2.8 trillion reached in October 
2014; the decline stemmed from both reductions in asset 
holdings and increases in nonreserve liabilities such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation.  Some recent survey 
information and other evidence suggested that reserves 
might begin to approach an efficient level later this year.  
Against this backdrop, the staff presented options for 
substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending 
the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the 
latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of 
the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time so that 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual 
pace reflecting the trend growth in other Federal Reserve 
liabilities.  

The staff also described options for communicating 
plans both for the operating regime and for the comple-
tion of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet.  
If the Committee reached a decision to continue using 
its current operating regime, announcing this decision 
after the current meeting would help reduce uncertainty 
about both the long-run implementation framework and 
the likely evolution of the balance sheet.  In addition, the 
Committee could revise its previous communications to 
make clear that it was flexible in its approach to normal-
izing the balance sheet and was prepared to change the 
details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of 
economic and financial developments if necessary to 
support the FOMC’s broader policy goals.  The staff 
noted that, after the end of asset redemptions, the Desk 
could reinvest principal payments received from hold-
ings of agency MBS in Treasury securities as directed. 

Participants noted some of the key advantages of the 
Federal Reserve’s current operating regime, including 
good control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions 
and good transmission to other money market rates and 
broader financial markets.  They observed that a regime 
that controlled the policy rate through active manage-
ment of the supply of reserves likely would have disad-
vantages.  In particular, the level and variability of re-
serve demand and supply were likely to be much larger 
than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the 
policy rate in this environment would require large and 
frequent open market operations.  Participants judged 
that, in light of their extensive previous discussions, it 
was now appropriate to provide the public with more 
certainty that the Federal Reserve would continue to use 
its current operating regime.  Choosing an operating re-
gime would also allow the Committee to move forward 
on related issues, including plans for concluding the nor-
malization of the size of the balance sheet.  Participants 
emphasized the importance of describing their chosen 
operating regime in clear terms to enhance public under-
standing. 

Participants discussed market commentary that sug-
gested that the process of balance sheet normalization 
might be influencing financial markets.  Participants 
noted that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Re-
serve’s asset holdings had proceeded smoothly for more 
than a year, with no significant effects on financial mar-
kets.  The gradual reduction in securities holdings had 
been announced well in advance and, as intended, was 

proceeding largely in the background, with the federal 
funds rate remaining the Committee’s primary tool for 
adjusting the stance of policy.  Nonetheless, some inves-
tors might have interpreted previous communications as 
indicating that a very high threshold would have to be 
met before the Committee would be willing to adjust its 
balance sheet normalization plans.  Participants ob-
served that, although the target range for the federal 
funds rate was the Committee’s primary means of ad-
justing the stance of policy, the balance sheet normaliza-
tion process should proceed in a way that supports the 
achievement of the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate 
goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  Con-
sistent with this principle, participants agreed that it was 
important to be flexible in managing the process of bal-
ance sheet normalization, and that it would be appropri-
ate to adjust the details of balance sheet normalization 
plans in light of economic and financial developments if 
necessary to achieve the Committee’s macroeconomic 
objectives. 

Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable 
to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the 
Federal Reserve’s asset holdings later this year.  Such an 
announcement would provide more certainty about the 
process for completing the normalization of the size of 
the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  A substantial ma-
jority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the 
level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than 
necessary for efficient and effective implementation of 
monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further 
very gradual decline in the average level of reserves, re-
flecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as Fed-
eral Reserve notes in circulation, could be appropriate.  
In these participants’ view, this process would allow the 
Federal Reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of 
reserves while maintaining good control of short-term 
interest rates without needing to engage in more fre-
quent open market operations.  A few participants 
judged that there would be little benefit to allowing re-
serves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or 
that this approach could have costs, such as an undue 
risk of volatility in short-term interest rates, that would 
exceed its benefits.  These participants thought that 
upon ending asset redemptions, the Federal Reserve 
should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in non-
reserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of re-
serves relatively stable.  A couple of participants sug-
gested that a ceiling facility to mitigate temporary unex-
pected pressures in reserve markets could play a useful 
role in supporting policy implementation at lower levels 
of reserves.

Participants commented that, in light of the Committee’s 
longstanding plan to hold primarily Treasury securities 
in the long run, it would be appropriate once asset re-
demptions end to reinvest most, if not all, principal pay-
ments received from agency MBS in Treasury securities.  
Some thought that continuing to reinvest agency MBS 
principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month in 
agency MBS, as under the current balance sheet normal-
ization plan, would simplify communications or provide 
a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large de-
clines in long-term interest rates caused agency MBS 
prepayment speeds to increase sharply.  However, some 
others judged that retaining the cap on agency MBS re-
demptions was unnecessary at this stage in the normali-
zation process.  These participants noted considerations 
in support of this view, including that principal payments 
were unlikely to reach the $20 billion level after 2019, 
that the cap could slightly slow the return to a portfolio 
of primarily Treasury securities, or that the Committee 
would have the flexibility to adjust the details of its bal-
ance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and 
financial developments.  Participants commented that it 
would be important over time to develop and communi-
cate plans for reinvesting agency MBS principal pay-
ments, and they expected to continue their discussion of 
balance sheet normalization and related issues at upcom-
ing meetings. 

Following the discussion, the Chairman proposed that 
the Committee communicate its intentions regarding 
monetary policy implementation and its willingness to 
adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization pro-
gram by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the 
meeting.  All participants agreed with the proposed 
statement. 

STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY 
POLICY IMPLEMENTATION  
AND BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION 

(Adopted January 30, 2019) 

After extensive deliberations and thorough re-
view of experience to date, the Committee judges that it 
is appropriate at this time to provide additional infor-
mation regarding its plans to implement monetary policy 

                                                           

5 The Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and 
Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and are available 
at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypol-
icy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.pdf.  On March 18, 
2015, the Committee adopted an addendum to the Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans, which is available at 

over the longer run.  Additionally, the Committee is re-
vising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under 
which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet nor-
malization program.5  Accordingly, all participants 
agreed to the following: 

• The Committee intends to continue to implement 
monetary policy in a regime in which an ample sup-
ply of reserves ensures that control over the level of 
the federal funds rate and other short-term interest 
rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the 
Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which 
active management of the supply of reserves is not 
required. 
 

• The Committee continues to view changes in the 
target range for the federal funds rate as its primary 
means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  
The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the de-
tails for completing balance sheet normalization in 
light of economic and financial developments.  
Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use 
its full range of tools, including altering the size and 
composition of its balance sheet, if future economic 
conditions were to warrant a more accommodative 
monetary policy than can be achieved solely by re-
ducing the federal funds rate. 

 
Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the January 29–30 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions continued to 
strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, 
although the availability of data was more limited than 
usual because of the partial federal government shut-
down that extended from December 22 to January 25.  
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 
12-month percentage change in the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), was a bit below 
2 percent in November, held down in part by recent de-
clines in consumer energy prices.  Survey-based 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypol-
icy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20150318.pdf.  On 
June 13, 2017, the Committee adopted a second addendum 
to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which is 
available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypol-
icy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf.

measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little 
changed. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in 
December.  The national unemployment rate edged up 
but was still at a low level of 3.9 percent, while the labor 
force participation rate also increased somewhat; as a re-
sult, the employment-to-population ratio remained 
steady in December.  The unemployment rates for Afri-
can Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in December were 
below their levels at the end of the previous economic 
expansion, although persistent differentials in unem-
ployment rates across groups remained.  The share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons con-
tinued to be close to the lows reached in late 2007.  The 
rates of private-sector job openings and quits edged 
down in November but were still at high levels; initial 
claims for unemployment insurance benefits through 
the middle of January were near historically low levels.  
Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.2 per-
cent over the 12 months ending in December. 

Industrial production increased solidly in December.  
Output gains were strong in the manufacturing and min-
ing sectors, while the output of utilities declined, with 
warmer-than-usual temperatures lowering the demand 
for heating.  Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested 
that the production of light motor vehicles would ease 
somewhat in the first quarter, although new orders in-
dexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys 
pointed to moderate gains in overall factory output in 
the coming months. 

Household spending looked to have increased strongly 
in the fourth quarter, as real PCE growth was strong in 
October and November.  The release of the retail sales 
report for December was delayed, but available indica-
tors—such as credit card and debit card transaction data 
and light motor vehicle sales—suggested that household 
spending growth remained strong in December.  Key 
factors that influence consumer spending—including 
ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and 
still-elevated measures of households’ net worth—con-
tinued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the 
near term.  Consumer sentiment, as measured by the 
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was less 
upbeat in early January than it had been last year but re-
mained at a generally favorable level. 

Real residential investment appeared to have declined 
again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part de-
creases in the affordability of housing arising from both 
the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past 
year and ongoing, though somewhat slower, house price 

appreciation.  Data on starts and permits for new resi-
dential construction in December were not available, but 
building permit issuance for new single-family homes—
which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying 
trend in construction of such homes—had moved down 
modestly in the previous couple of months.  Sales of ex-
isting homes decreased, on net, over November and De-
cember, while data on new home sales for those two 
months were delayed.  

Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property looked to have picked up 
solidly in the fourth quarter.  Nominal shipments of 
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose, on bal-
ance, in October and November, while information on 
shipments for December was delayed; available indica-
tors of transportation equipment spending in the fourth 
quarter were strong.  Forward-looking indicators of 
business equipment spending—such as orders for non-
defense capital goods excluding aircraft and readings on 
business sentiment—pointed to somewhat slower 
spending gains in the near term.  Data on nominal busi-
ness expenditures for nonresidential structures outside 
of the drilling and mining sector in November were not 
available.  The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs 
in operation—an indicator of business spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector—was roughly 
flat in December and through most of January. 

Total real government purchases appeared to have in-
creased moderately in the fourth quarter.  Nominal de-
fense spending in October and November pointed to 
solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending 
data for December were delayed.  The partial federal 
government shutdown restrained real federal purchases 
somewhat in the fourth quarter and likely had a more 
significant negative effect on federal purchases in the 
first quarter.  Real purchases by state and local govern-
ments looked to have risen modestly in the fourth quar-
ter, as the payrolls of those governments expanded a bit 
over that period.  Nominal state and local construction 
spending had risen solidly in October, but construction 
data for November were delayed. 

Data on U.S. international trade for November and De-
cember also were delayed.  The available data for Octo-
ber suggested that the contribution of the change in net 
exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would 
be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percent-
age points in the third quarter.  

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months 
ending in November.  Core PCE price inflation, which 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019 Page 13



excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, 
was 1.9 percent over that same period.  The consumer 
price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months 
ending in December, while core CPI inflation was 
2.2 percent.  Recent readings on survey-based measures 
of longer-run inflation expectations—including those 
from the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were 
little changed. 

Recent data suggested that foreign economic growth was 
subdued in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the 
year.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), espe-
cially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weak-
ened further, though they remained consistent with pos-
itive economic growth.  In the emerging market econo-
mies (EMEs), growth in Mexico and Brazil appeared to 
have slowed to a modest pace in the fourth quarter after 
a temporary pickup in the third quarter.  The Chinese 
economy expanded at a slower pace than earlier in the 
year amid notable weakness in household spending, and 
Chinese imports from other emerging Asian economies 
turned down.  Foreign inflation fell in the fourth quarter, 
largely reflecting lower oil prices.  Inflation pressures, es-
pecially in some AFEs, generally remained muted.  

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investor risk sentiment fluctuated materially over the in-
termeeting period.  A variety of factors—including 
FOMC communications, weaker-than-expected data, 
trade policy uncertainties, the partial federal government 
shutdown, and concerns about the outlook for corpo-
rate earnings—were cited by market participants as con-
tributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment early in the 
period.  During this time, broad equity indexes declined 
substantially amid a sharp rise in financial market vola-
tility, and corporate bond spreads widened notably.  
Subsequently, positive signals regarding trade policy, ro-
bust economic data releases, and communications from 
FOMC participants led to an improvement in risk senti-
ment.  On net, the S&P 500 index rose, option-implied 
volatility—the VIX—fell, Treasury yields declined, and 
corporate spreads narrowed over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Despite the intermeeting moves in financial mar-
kets, financial conditions remained notably tighter than 
in September 2018.  Financing conditions for businesses 
and households tightened a bit further over the inter-
meeting period but remained generally supportive of 
spending. 

December FOMC communications were reportedly per-
ceived by market participants as not fully appreciating 

the implications of tighter financial conditions and sof-
tening global data over recent months for the U.S. eco-
nomic outlook.  Subsequent communications from 
FOMC participants were interpreted as suggesting that 
the FOMC would be patient in assessing the implica-
tions of recent economic and financial developments.  
The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 
2019 was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting 
period and investors continued to expect no change to 
the target range for the federal funds rate at the January 
FOMC meeting.  The market-implied path for 
2020 shifted down somewhat. 

Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated substantially, with 
heightened risk aversion contributing to a significant de-
cline in yields early in the intermeeting period.  Subse-
quently, yields rose, though 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields still 
ended the period somewhat lower, on net.  The spread 
between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury 
securities was little changed over the period, and re-
mained in the lower end of its historical range over re-
cent decades.  The near-term forward spread—the dif-
ference between the current implied three-month for-
ward rate at a horizon six quarters ahead (derived from 
the Treasury yield curve) and the current yield on a 
three-month Treasury bill—narrowed, on net, and also 
was in the lower end of its historical distribution.  The 
5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward inflation compensation 
measures based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securi-
ties (TIPS) edged down a bit over the period; both 
measures were down significantly from levels prevailing 
in the fall of last year. 

In U.S. risky asset markets, the S&P 500 equity index was 
down as much as 8 percent at one point during the pe-
riod but ended the period notably higher.  On net, the 
VIX fell substantially while corporate bond spreads nar-
rowed a bit.   

The federal funds rate and other overnight funding rates 
rose following the increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting.  
Year-end pressures in repo markets were reportedly ex-
acerbated by a high volume of settlements of Treasury 
securities against a backdrop of large dealer inventories 
and reduced intermediation by global systemically im-
portant banks.  General collateral repo rates moved up 
sharply at year-end but subsequently returned to normal 
levels. 

Foreign financial markets followed the same general pat-
tern as those in the United States.  On balance, foreign 
equity prices moved up moderately and sovereign credit

spreads in EMEs narrowed.  Moreover, inflows to dedi-
cated emerging market funds resumed after two quarters 
of outflows.  Longer-term sovereign yields in AFEs 
edged lower on net.  

The dollar depreciated broadly amid falling U.S. yields 
and greater investor optimism about prospects for some 
EMEs.  The dollar depreciated notably against the Brit-
ish pound, on net, as market participants reportedly saw 
an increased likelihood of a delay in the Brexit process.  
The dollar also depreciated considerably against the Bra-
zilian real and the Mexican peso following progress on 
pension reform in Brazil and a fiscal announcement in 
Mexico that was perceived as prudent. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms tightened 
somewhat, on balance.  Gross issuance of corporate 
bonds slowed considerably in December across the 
credit rating spectrum but rebounded in January.  Even 
so, the volume of high-yield bonds issued by nonfinan-
cial firms remained well below its average over the past 
few years.  Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds 
were volatile but narrowed a bit, on net, and stayed at 
levels well above those that prevailed a year ago.  The 
credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to 
show signs of deterioration, although actual corporate 
bond defaults remained low overall.  Institutional lever-
aged loan issuance slowed in December to its lowest 
level since July 2016, as loan spreads widened substan-
tially.  Small business credit market conditions were little 
changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond mar-
kets stayed accommodative on net. 

Private-sector analysts significantly revised down their 
projections for corporate earnings for the fourth quarter 
and for 2019 as a whole.  The pace of gross equity issu-
ance through both initial and seasoned offerings was 
sluggish in December, amid reports that several firms 
may have pushed back initial equity offerings. 

Respondents to the January 2019 Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) re-
ported that lending standards for commercial and indus-
trial (C&I) loans remained basically unchanged in the 
fourth quarter, after having reported easing standards 
over the past several quarters.  Growth of C&I loans on 
banks’ balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, 
reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced pay-
downs and loan sales.  

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions remained accommodative.  Although com-
mercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) spreads 
were volatile, they were little changed, on net, over the 

intermeeting period, and issuance of both agency and 
non-agency CMBS remained strong.  CRE loan growth 
at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with 
that seen over the course of 2018.  Banks in the January 
SLOOS reported that demand was unchanged, on net, 
in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, 
the largest CRE loan category, while demand was report-
edly weaker for multifamily loans and construction 
loans.  On balance, banks reported tightening their 
standards for all types of CRE loans in the fourth quar-
ter. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
also remained accommodative for most borrowers.  Pur-
chase mortgage origination activity continued to decline 
modestly through November, while refinancing activity 
continued to be muted.   

In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tight-
ened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive 
of growth in household spending.  Banks reported in the 
SLOOS that they tightened credit card lending standards 
during the fourth quarter.  In the consumer asset-backed 
securities market, spreads widened somewhat amid 
broad market volatility.   

The staff provided an update on its views with respect 
to potential risks to financial stability.  The increase in 
financial market volatility seen over the fall of last year 
was characterized as a return to historically more typical 
levels, following the historically low-volatility environ-
ment that persisted through much of 2017 and 2018.  
However, the increase in volatility in financial markets in 
December was viewed as substantial and as likely exac-
erbated by thin year-end liquidity, among other factors.  
Staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and cor-
porate debt markets to have abated somewhat in the pe-
riod since the assessment presented in the November 
2018 financial stability report.  Staff continued to moni-
tor developments in the leveraged loan market given the 
sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last 
year.  The build-up in overall nonfinancial business debt 
to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was 
viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to 
the business sector.  Staff continued to judge risks asso-
ciated with household-sector debt as moderate.  Both 
the risks associated with financial leverage and the vul-
nerabilities related to maturity transformation were 
viewed as being low, as they have been for some time. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
January FOMC meeting was revised down a little, on 
balance, primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected

paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic 
growth.  The staff estimated that U.S. real GDP growth 
was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, bolstered by 
consumer spending and business investment, and that 
the effects of the partial federal government shutdown 
were quite small in that quarter.  Real GDP growth was 
expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this 
year, with the effects of the partial federal government 
shutdown modestly restraining GDP growth in the first 
quarter and those effects being reversed in the second 
quarter.  In the medium term, real GDP growth in 
2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff’s esti-
mate of potential output growth, step down to the 
growth rate of potential output next year and then slow 
further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021.  
The unemployment rate was projected to decline some-
what further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run 
natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and 
begin to edge up in 2021.  With labor market conditions 
judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume 
that projected employment gains would manifest in 
smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unem-
ployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure 
on the labor force participation rate.       

The staff’s forecast for inflation was little revised for the 
January FOMC meeting.  Core PCE price inflation was 
still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a 
whole and then to run at that level through the medium 
term.  Total PCE price inflation was forecast to be a little 
below core inflation this year and next, reflecting pro-
jected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the 
same level as core inflation in 2021.   

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.  
On the upside, household spending and business invest-
ment could expand faster than the staff projected, sup-
ported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year.  On the 
downside, trade policies and foreign economic develop-
ments could move in directions that have significant 
negative effects on U.S. economic growth.  Risks to the 
inflation projection also were seen as balanced.  The up-
side risk that inflation could increase more than expected 
in an economy that was projected to move further above 
its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk 
that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower 
than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the pos-
sibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign eco-
nomic conditions deteriorated. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
Participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Job gains 
had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the 
unemployment rate had remained low.  Household 
spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth 
of business fixed investment had moderated from its 
rapid pace earlier last year.  On a 12-month basis, both 
overall inflation and inflation for items other than food 
and energy had remained near 2 percent.  Although mar-
ket-based measures of inflation compensation had 
moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. 

Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few 
years.  Participants generally continued to expect the 
growth rate of real GDP in 2019 to step down somewhat 
from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their 
estimates of longer-run growth, with a few participants 
commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to 
contribute to the step-down.  Several participants com-
mented that they had nudged down their outlooks for 
output growth since the December meeting, citing a sof-
tening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in 
the outlook for foreign economic growth, or the tight-
ening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent 
months. 

In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
noted that recent data on spending had been strong, sup-
ported by a strong job market and rising incomes.  A 
couple of participants commented that contacts in their 
Districts remained optimistic about consumer spending.  
However, some participants noted the recent softening 
in surveys of consumer sentiment.  Participants ob-
served that the recent partial federal government shut-
down had presented a significant hardship for many 
families.  A few participants also pointed to continued 
weakness in the housing sector, which was attributed in 
part to concerns about affordability among potential 
homebuyers.   

Participants noted that growth of business fixed invest-
ment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.  
Some participants highlighted that recent surveys of 
business sentiment or District contacts had indicated 
some weakening in optimism or confidence about the 
economic outlook, though available indicators suggested 

Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



that the level of business sentiment had remained high.  
Concerns about the economic outlook were variously at-
tributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global 
economic growth, including in Europe and China; trade 
policy; waning fiscal policy stimulus; and the partial gov-
ernment shutdown.  Manufacturing contacts in a num-
ber of Districts indicated that such factors were causing 
them to delay or defer capital expenditures.  In addition, 
a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gas-
oline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures 
in the energy sector.  A few participants observed that 
conditions in the agricultural sector remained difficult, 
citing large inventories of agricultural commodities, un-
certainty about international trade policies, and concerns 
regarding low prices of commodities and farmland.  
However, a few participants commented that business 
optimism had increased among contacts in their Dis-
tricts, or that they were planning new capital expendi-
tures.   

Participants observed that both overall inflation and in-
flation for items other than food and energy remained 
near 2 percent on a 12-month basis.  Participants con-
tinued to view inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective as the most likely outcome.  Some 
participants noted that some factors, such as the decline 
in oil prices, slower growth and softer inflation abroad, 
or appreciation of the dollar last year, had held down 
some recent inflation readings and may continue to do 
so this year.  In addition, many participants commented 
that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more 
muted than they appeared to be last year despite 
strengthening labor market conditions and rising input 
costs for some industries.   

In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta-
tions, participants noted that market-based measures of 
inflation compensation had moved lower in recent 
months.  Participants expressed a range of views in in-
terpreting the decline in inflation compensation.  On the 
one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease in ex-
pected inflation on the part of market participants.  In 
that case, the current low levels of inflation compensa-
tion could suggest that inflation expectations are below 
the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  On the 
other hand, the decline in inflation compensation might 
reflect in large part declines in risk premiums or in-
creased concerns about downside risks to the outlook 
for inflation.  This interpretation was seen as consistent 
with the behavior of the most recent survey-based 
measures of expected inflation, which were little 
changed.   

In their discussion of labor markets, participants agreed 
that conditions had continued to strengthen.  Estimates 
of job gains in the December employment report had 
been strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, 
and the labor force participation rate had moved up.  
Several participants noted solid rates of hiring or other 
indicators of tight labor market conditions in their Dis-
tricts.  Some participants commented on recent indica-
tors at the national or District levels as suggesting a 
pickup in wage growth.  The pickup was attributed to 
tightening in national or District labor market conditions 
or to gains in the rate of productivity growth.  Continued 
solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor nec-
essary to support rising real wages over time. 

Participants commented on a number of risks associated 
with their outlook for economic activity, the labor mar-
ket, and inflation over the medium term.  Participants 
noted that some risks to the downside had increased, in-
cluding the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected 
slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in 
China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stim-
ulus, or a further tightening of financial market condi-
tions.  An increase in some foreign and domestic gov-
ernment policy uncertainties, including those associated 
with Brexit, an escalation in international trade policy 
tensions, and the potential for additional extended fed-
eral government shutdowns were also cited as downside 
risks.  A few participants expressed concern that longer-
run inflation expectations may be lower than levels con-
sistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec-
tive.  Several participants judged that risks that could 
lead to higher-than-expected inflation had diminished 
relative to downside risks.  The potential that various 
sources of uncertainty might abate more quickly than ex-
pected was mentioned as a potential upside risk for the 
economic outlook.  

In their discussion of financial developments, partici-
pants noted that although financial market conditions 
had not changed much, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, prices had been volatile and financial conditions 
were materially tighter than they had been several 
months ago, with lower equity prices and wider corpo-
rate risk spreads.  Several participants also noted that the 
slope of the Treasury yield curve was unusually flat by 
historical standards, which in the past had often been as-
sociated with a deterioration in future macroeconomic 
performance.  Participants noted that financial asset 
prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding 
trade policy tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary pol-
icy, and global economic growth prospects.  A couple of 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019 Page 17



participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over re-
cent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future 
economic activity.  Participants agreed that it was im-
portant to continue to monitor financial market devel-
opments and assess the implications of these develop-
ments for the economic outlook. 

Among those participants who commented on financial 
stability, a number expressed concerns about the ele-
vated financial market volatility and the apparent decline 
in investors’ willingness to bear risk that occurred to-
ward the end of last year.  Although these conditions had 
eased somewhat in recent weeks, a couple of participants 
noted that the strain in financial markets might have per-
sisted or spread if it had occurred during a period of less 
favorable macroeconomic conditions.  A couple of par-
ticipants highlighted the role that decreased liquidity at 
the end of the year appeared to play in exacerbating 
changes in financial market conditions.  They empha-
sized the need to monitor financial market structures or 
practices that may contribute to strained liquidity condi-
tions.  A few participants highlighted the importance of 
ensuring that financial institutions were able to with-
stand adverse financial market events—for instance, by 
maintaining adequate levels of capital.  

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants judged that information received since De-
cember indicated that real economic activity had been 
rising at a solid rate, labor market conditions had contin-
ued to strengthen, and inflation had been near the Com-
mittee’s objective.  Participants generally expected eco-
nomic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in 
the period ahead, with strong labor market conditions 
and inflation near 2 percent.  At the time of the Decem-
ber meeting, the Committee had noted that it would 
continue to monitor global economic and financial de-
velopments and assess their implications for the eco-
nomic outlook.  Participants observed that since then, 
the economic outlook had become more uncertain.  Fi-
nancial market volatility had remained elevated over the 
intermeeting period, and, despite some easing since the 
December FOMC meeting, overall financial conditions 
had tightened since September.  In addition, the global 
economy had continued to record slower growth, and 
consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated.  The 
government policy environment, including trade negoti-
ations and the recent partial federal government shut-
down, was also seen as a factor contributing to uncer-
tainty about the economic outlook. 

Based on their current assessments, all participants ex-
pressed the view that it would be appropriate for the 

Committee to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent.  With regard to the 
Committee’s postmeeting statement, participants sup-
ported a proposed change in the forward guidance lan-
guage that would replace the previous guidance referring 
to “some further gradual increases in the target range for 
the federal funds rate” with an indication that, in light of 
“global economic and financial developments and 
muted inflation pressures,” the Committee would “be 
patient as it determines what future adjustments to the 
target range for the federal funds rate may be appropri-
ate.”  Participants also supported a proposal to remove 
from the statement the characterization of risks to the 
economic outlook as “roughly balanced.” 

Participants pointed to a variety of considerations that 
supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this 
juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks 
and uncertainties in the outlook.  With regard to the do-
mestic economic picture, additional data would help pol-
icymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer 
sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total 
inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and 
the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on ag-
gregate demand.  Information arriving in coming 
months could also shed light on the effects of the recent 
partial federal government shutdown on the U.S. econ-
omy and on the results of the budget negotiations occur-
ring in the wake of the shutdown, including the possible 
implications for the path of fiscal policy.  A patient ap-
proach would have the added benefit of giving policy-
makers an opportunity to judge the response of eco-
nomic activity and inflation to the recent steps taken to 
normalize the stance of monetary policy.  Furthermore, 
a patient posture would allow time for a clearer picture 
of the international trade policy situation and the state 
of the global economy to emerge and, in particular, 
could allow policymakers to reach a firmer judgment 
about the extent and persistence of the economic slow-
down in Europe and China.   

Participants noted that maintaining the current target 
range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks 
at this point.  The current level of the federal funds rate 
was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the 
neutral policy rate.  Moreover, inflation pressures were 
muted, and asset valuations were less stretched than they 
had been a few months earlier.  Many participants sug-
gested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the 
target range for the federal funds rate may be appropri-
ate later this year; several of these participants argued 
that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation 
outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook.  

Page 18 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Several other participants indicated that, if the economy 
evolved as they expected, they would view it as appro-
priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 
later this year. 

Participants observed that a patient posture in these cir-
cumstances was consistent with their general approach 
to setting the stance of policy, in which they were im-
portantly guided by the implications of incoming data 
for the economic outlook.  Some participants noted that, 
while global economic and financial developments had 
been important factors leading to a patient monetary 
policy posture, those developments mattered because 
they affected assessments of the policy rate path most 
consistent with achievement of the Committee’s dual-
mandate goals of maximum employment and price sta-
bility.  Many participants observed that if uncertainty 
abated, the Committee would need to reassess the char-
acterization of monetary policy as “patient” and might 
then use different statement language.   

A few participants expressed concerns that in the current 
environment of increased uncertainty, the policy rate 
projections prepared as part of the Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections (SEP) do not accurately convey the 
Committee’s policy outlook.  These participants were 
concerned that, although the individual participants’ 
projections for the federal funds rate in the SEP reflect 
their individual views of the appropriate path for the pol-
icy rate conditional on the evolution of the economic 
outlook, at times the public had misinterpreted the me-
dian or central tendency of those projections as repre-
senting the consensus view of the Committee or as sug-
gesting that policy was on a preset course.  However, 
some other participants noted that the policy rate pro-
jections in the SEP are a valuable component of the 
overall information provided about the monetary policy 
outlook. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in December indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and that economic 
activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Job gains had been 
strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had remained low.  Household spending had 
continued to grow strongly, while growth of business 
fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace ear-
lier last year.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation 
and inflation for items other than food and energy re-
mained near 2 percent.  Although market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in 

recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations were little changed. 

In their consideration of the economic outlook, mem-
bers noted that financial conditions had tightened, on 
net, since September, and that global growth had mod-
erated; members also observed that a number of uncer-
tainties, including those pertaining to the evolution of 
policies of the U.S. and foreign governments, still 
awaited resolution.  However, members continued to 
view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong 
labor market conditions, and inflation near the Commit-
tee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely 
outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead.  In 
light of global economic and financial developments and 
muted inflation pressures, the Committee could be pa-
tient as it determined what future adjustments to the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate 
to support these outcomes. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent.  Members agreed that 
in determining the timing and size of future adjustments 
to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com-
mittee would assess realized and expected economic 
conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum em-
ployment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives.  
They reiterated that this assessment would take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including measures 
of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres-
sures and inflation expectations, and readings on finan-
cial and international developments.  More generally, 
members noted that decisions regarding near-term ad-
justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro-
priately remain dependent on the evolution of the out-
look as informed by incoming data. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to change the characterization of recent growth 
in economic activity from “strong” to “solid,” consistent 
with incoming information that suggested that the pace 
of expansion of the U.S. economy had moderated some-
what since late last year.  The description of indicators 
of inflation expectations was revised to recognize that 
the downward moves in market-based measures of in-
flation compensation that occurred in recent months 
had been sustained, while also noting that survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed.  Members also agreed to several adjust-
ments in the description of the outlook for the economy 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019 Page 19



and monetary policy.  The statement language was re-
vised to indicate that the Committee continued to view 
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent as “the 
most likely outcomes.”  Members also agreed to add a 
sentence indicating that, in light of “global economic and 
financial developments and muted inflation pressures, 
the Committee will be patient as it determines what fu-
ture adjustments to the target range for the federal funds 
rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.”  
This sentence was intended to convey the Committee’s 
view that a patient and flexible approach was appropriate 
at this time as a way to manage risks while assessing in-
coming information bearing on the economic outlook.  
In light of the range of uncertainties associated with 
global economic and financial developments, the Com-
mittee decided that it was not useful at this time to ex-
press a judgment about the balance of risks.  

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective January 31, 2019, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re-
verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-
chase operations with maturities of more than 
one day when necessary to accommodate week-
end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at 
an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim-
ited only by the value of Treasury securities held 
outright in the System Open Market Account 
that are available for such operations and by a 
per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during each cal-
endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to 
continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-
backed securities the amount of principal pay-
ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities received during each calendar month that 
exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from 

these amounts for operational reasons are ac-
ceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in December indicates 
that the labor market has continued to 
strengthen and that economic activity has been 
rising at a solid rate.  Job gains have been strong, 
on average, in recent months, and the unem-
ployment rate has remained low.  Household 
spending has continued to grow strongly, while 
growth of business fixed investment has mod-
erated from its rapid pace earlier last year.  On a 
12-month basis, both overall inflation and infla-
tion for items other than food and energy re-
main near 2 percent.  Although market-based 
measures of inflation compensation have 
moved lower in recent months, survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
are little changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  In support of these goals, 
the Committee decided to maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 
2½ percent.  The Committee continues to view 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of 
global economic and financial developments 
and muted inflation pressures, the Committee 
will be patient as it determines what future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate may be appropriate to support these 
outcomes. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
