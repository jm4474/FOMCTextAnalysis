With Mr. Ford dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by 

the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 

accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
little change in real GNP in the fourth quarter and 
continuation of the rise in prices at a much less rapid 
pace than in 1981. In October the nominal value of 
retail sales edged up, but was little higher than in 
the second and third quarters; industrial production 
and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline; 
and the unemployment rate rose another 0.3 percentage 
point to 10.4 percent. Initial claims for unemployment 
insurance have remained exceptionally high. In September 
and the third quarter as a whole, housing starts had 
strengthened. In recent months the advance in the 
index of average hourly earnings has remained consider
ably less rapid than during 1981.  

The weighted average value of the dollar against 
major foreign currencies continued to appreciate from the 

end of September to mid-November. The U.S. merchandise 
trade deficit in the third quarter was more than double 
the rate in the first two quarters of the year.  

Growth of M1, already rapid in August and September, 
accelerated sharply in October in association with the 
maturing of a large volume of all savers certificates.  
Growth of M2 and M3 picked up from.sluggish rates in 
September, but remained below the brisk pace of earlier 
in the year. Most short-term market interest rates have 
declined on balance since early October, after a reversal 
in September, and bond yields and mortgage rates have 
declined further. On October 8 the Federal Reserve 
announced a reduction in the discount rate from 10 percent 
to 9-1/2 percent. Quality spreads in the money markets, 
which had widened, have narrowed in recent weeks as 
interest rates have declined, and common stock prices 
have advanced sharply.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster 
monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce 
inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on 
a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable 
pattern of international transactions. In July, the 
Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered 
by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period 
from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 
1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These 
ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent 
for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated 
range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee 
agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates 
around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable 
in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 
target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for 
some period of time growth somewhat above the target 
range should unusual precautionary demands for money and 
liquidity be evident in the light of current economic 
uncertainties. The Committee also indicated that it 
was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges 
for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully 
in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  

Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance 
of the year remains subject to substantial uncertainty 
because of special circumstances in connection with the 

reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certifi
cates and the public's response to the new account 
directly competitive with money market funds mandated 
by recent legislation. The difficulties in interpreta
tion of M1 continue to suggest that much less than 
usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate 
during the current quarter.  

In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to 
maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly 
and sustained flow of money and credit, consistent with 
growth of M2 (and M3) of around 9-1/2 percent at an annual 
rate from September to December. Somewhat slower growth, 
bringing those aggregates around the upper part of the 
ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and desirable 
in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic 
and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity 
demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggre
gates would be tolerated. The Chairman may call for 
Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for 
Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives 
and related reserve paths during the period before the next 
meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds 
rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.
