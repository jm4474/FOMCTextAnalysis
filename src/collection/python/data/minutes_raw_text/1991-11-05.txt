By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government 

securities and federal agency obligations during the period October 1, 

1991, through November 4, 1991, were ratified.  

By unanimous vote, paragraph l.A of the Authorization for Domestic 

Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion to $10 billion 

the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System Account holdings of U.S.  

government and federal agency securities for the intermeeting period 

through December 17, 1991.  

With Messrs. Angell and Kelley dissenting, the Federal Reserve 

Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by 

the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance 

with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting portrays 
a sluggish economy and a marked deterioration in 
business and consumer confidence. Total nonfarm pay
roll employment was unchanged in October after rising 
slightly over the third quarter, and the civilian 
unemployment rate edged back up to 6.8 percent.  
Industrial production has been flat in recent months.  
Consumer spending increased considerably through the 
summer, in part because of a sizable rise in expendi
tures on motor vehicles; sales of motor vehicles slowed 
in October, however. Real outlays for business 
equipment--especially for computers--have been rising, 
but nonresidential construction has continued to 
decline. Housing starts and home sales have weakened 
recently. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit 
in July-August was significantly above its average rate 
in the second quarter. Wage and price increases have 
continued to trend downward.  

Short-term interest rates have declined somewhat 
further since the Committee meeting on October 1, while 
bond yields are about unchanged to slightly higher on 
balance. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance 
over the intermeeting period.  

Expansion in M2 and M3 resumed in October, albeit 
at a slow pace. For the year through October, expan
sion of both M2 and M3 is estimated to have been at the 
lower ends of the Committee's ranges.



The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster price sta
bility and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had estab
lished in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 
6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, 
measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth 
quarter of 1991. The monitoring range for growth of 
total domestic nonfinancial debt also was maintained at 
4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. For 1992, on a 
tentative basis, the Committee agreed in July to use 
the same ranges as in 1991 for growth in each of the 
monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth 
quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. With 
regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the 
ongoing restructuring of thrift depository institutions 
would continue to depress the growth of this aggregate 
relative to spending and total credit. The behavior of 
the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
economy and financial markets.  

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat the 
existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.  
Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends 
in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary 
aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and 
domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve 
restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period 
from September through December at annual rates of 
about 3 and 1 percent, respectively.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would 

be held on Tuesday, December 17, 1991.  

The meeting adjourned.
