shown below was reaffirmed: 

AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 
Reaffirmed April 1, 1986 

1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent 
necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and 
express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity 
with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to 
time:

4/1/86 - 6 -



A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of 
cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at 
home and abroad, including transactions with the U. S. Treasury, with the 
U. S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold 
Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank 
for International Settlements, and with other international financial 
institutions:

receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.  

C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars 
under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, 
provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be 
fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time 
was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, 
specifically authorizes a delay.  

D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not 
exceeding $10.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all 
foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net posi
tions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign 
currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus out
standing contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for 
future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements 
with due regard to sign.  

2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) 

for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months 
with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of 

Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval 
of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:

for review and approval to the Committee.  

3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 
1(A) above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, 
be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment 
return on System holdings of foreign currencies, or for the purpose of 

adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, 
transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market 
exchange rates.  

4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks

5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as practicable, 
considering needs for minimum working balances. Such investments shall be

maturity. When appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide 
investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U. S. Government 
securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements 
for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.  

6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall 

be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  
The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman 
of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other 

member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of 
members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board Members 
designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice 
Chairman of the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee 
shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the 
Manager for Foreign Operations, for the purposes of reviewing recent or 
contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other 
matters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any member 

of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations 
shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee.

4/1/86 - 10 -



By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with respect to 

Foreign Currency Operations shown below were reaffirmed: 

PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 
Reaffirmed April 1, 1986 

In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction 
of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for 
Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager for Foreign Operations, System 
Open Market Account, shall be guided by the following procedural understandings 
with respect to consultations and clearance with the Committee, the Foreign 
Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All operations 
undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the 
Committee.  

1. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall clear with the Subcommittee 
(or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with 
the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available): 

A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall 
open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or 
$600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  

B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the 
System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, 
or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap 
drawings.  

C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading 
in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's 
net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in lB.  

D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the 
larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrange

ment.  

2. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall clear with the Committee (or 
with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with 
the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chair
man, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is 
not feasible in the time available): 

A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall 
open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most 
recent regular meeting of the Committee.  

B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger 
of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.

4/1/86 - 11 -



3. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Sub
committee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and 
about any operations that are not of a routine character.  

By unanimous vote, responsibility for making determinations with 

respect to appeals of denial of access to Committee records under the 

provisions of 271.4(d) of the Committee's Rules Regarding Availability of 

Information was delegated to Mr. Rice, and in the absence of Mr. Rice, 

to Mr. Johnson.  

By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of 

the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 11-12, 1986, were approved.  

By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government 

securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period 

February 12 through March 31, 1986, were ratified.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized 

and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions 

in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
a mixed pattern of developments with evidence of a 
pickup in economic activity from the reduced fourth
quarter pace but with spending sluggish in some key 
sectors. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased 
appreciably further in February following a large rise 
in January, but employment in manufacturing fell after 
four months of gains and industrial production declined.  
The civilian unemployment rate rose sharply to 7.3 
percent. Retail sales were little changed in January 
and February after rising over the previous two months, 
while housing starts were well above their pace in late 
1985. Business capital spending apparently weakened 
somewhat in early 1986. The merchandise trade deficit 
for January appears to have been only slightly smaller 
than in December; preliminary data for February suggest 
that exports increased and that the price and quantity

4/1/86 - 12 -



- 13 -

of oil imports declined. Largely reflecting declines 
in energy prices, consumer prices edged down on balance 
over the first two months of 1986 and producer prices 
fell substantially.  

Growth in M1 picked up considerably over the course 
of the first quarter, leaving this aggregate by March 
somewhat above the upper end of its range for the year.  

On the other hand, growth of M2 was generally sluggish 
over the past 3 months and was running below its long-run 
range. Expansion of M3 was moderate during the winter 
months, with growth around the midpoint of its range for 
1986. Interest rates have declined considerably since 
the February meeting of the Committee. On March 6, the 
Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount 
rate from 7-1/2 to 7 percent. The trade-weighted value 
of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued 
to decline through mid-March but has risen somewhat more 
recently; on balance the dollar has declined slightly 
since the February meeting.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 
financial conditions that will foster reasonable price 

stability over time, promote growth in output on a sus
tainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern 
of international transactions. In furtherance of these 
objectives the Committee agreed at its February meeting 
to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, 
measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth 
quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee 
recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, 
the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial 
uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and 
prices, depending among other things on its responsive
ness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an 

appropriate target range under existing circumstances 
would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate 
movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the 
other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy 
and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures.  
It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 

percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total 
domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent 
for the year 1986.

4/1/86



4/1/86

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is 
expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over 
the period from March to June at annual rates of about 
7 percent; while the behavior of M1 continues to be 

subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate 
of about 7 to 8 percent over the period is anticipated.  
Somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater 
reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on 
behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business 
expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, 
progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic 
and international credit markets. The Chairman may 
call for Committee consultation if it appears to the 
Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions 
during the period before the next meeting are likely 
to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently 
outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on Tuesday, May 20, 1986.  

The meeting adjourned.
