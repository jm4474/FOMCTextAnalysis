10/29/68

By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in 

Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances 

during the period October 8 through 28, 1968, were approved, rati

fied, and confirmed.  

With Mr. Hayes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the 

Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accord

ance with the following current economic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
that over-all economic expansion has moderated somewhat 
from its very rapid pace earlier in the year, although 
less than projected, and that upward pressures on prices 
and costs are persisting. Market interest rates have 
risen in recent weeks. Bank credit and time and savings 
deposits have continued to expand rapidly, but savings 
inflows to thrift institutions have remained moderate.  

The money supply, after growing little on balance during 
the summer, has increased in recent weeks. The U.S.  
foreign trade balance and underlying payments position 
continue to be matters of serious concern. In this 

situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market 
Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to 
sustainable economic growth, continued resistance to 

inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable 

equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  

To implement this policy, while taking account of 

the current Treasury financing, System open market 

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall 

be conducted with a view to maintaining about the 

prevailing conditions in money and short-term credit 

markets; provided, however, that operations shall be 

modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury 
financing, if bank credit expansion appears to be 
exceeding current projections.



10/29/68 -5

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would 

be held on Tuesday, November 26, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
