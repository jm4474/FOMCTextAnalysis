Developments in Financial Markets and Open  
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in U.S. and global 

financial markets during the period since the Committee 
met on January 31 and February 1, 2017.  Global equity 
prices generally increased further, credit spreads on cor-
porate debt and emerging market bonds narrowed, and 
yields on Treasury securities rose somewhat.  In survey 
responses, market participants again reported elevated 
uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. economic policies 
and about financial asset prices, but various measures of 
implied volatility nonetheless declined further.  The 
monetary policies of other advanced-economy central 
banks remained quite accommodative, and some signs 
of progress on central banks’ inflation mandates were 
evident.  Late in the intermeeting period, market partic-
ipants came to interpret U.S. monetary policy communi-
cations as implying high odds of a firming of monetary 
policy at this meeting, and changes in market prices sug-
gested a slightly steeper path for the federal funds rate 
over the next few years than was previously anticipated.  
Survey results indicated that market participants saw a 
change in the FOMC’s policy of reinvesting principal 
payments on its securities holdings as most likely to be 
announced in late 2017 or the first half of 2018.  Most 
market participants anticipated that, once a change to re-
investment policy was announced, reinvestments would 
most likely be phased out rather than stopped all at once. 

The deputy manager followed with a briefing on devel-
opments in money markets and open market operations.  
Over the intermeeting period, federal funds continued 
to trade near the center of the Committee’s ½ to ¾ per-
cent target range except on month-ends.  Spreads of 
rates on market repurchase agreements (repos) over the 
rate at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agree-
ment (ON RRP) facility remained relatively low.  Market 
participants attributed some of the recent decline in mar-
ket repo rates to a reduction in the supply of Treasury 
bills in advance of the reinstatement of the statutory debt 
limit on March 16.  The lower market repo rates had led 
to moderately higher take-up at the ON RRP facility in 
recent weeks.  

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet-
ing period.  There were no intervention operations in 
foreign currencies for the System’s account during the 
intermeeting period. 

System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy 
The staff provided several briefings that summarized is-
sues related to potential changes to the Committee’s pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from securities 
held in the SOMA.  These briefings discussed the mac-
roeconomic implications of alternative strategies the

Committee could employ with respect to reinvestments, 
including making the timing of an end to reinvestments 
either date dependent or dependent on economic condi-
tions.  The briefings also considered the advantages and 
disadvantages of phasing out reinvestments or ending 
them all at once as well as whether using the same ap-
proach would be appropriate for both Treasury securi-
ties and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). 

In their discussion, policymakers reaffirmed the ap-
proach to balance sheet normalization articulated in the 
Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans 
announced in September 2014.  In particular, partici-
pants agreed that reductions in the Federal Reserve’s se-
curities holdings should be gradual and predictable, and 
accomplished primarily by phasing out reinvestments of 
principal received from those holdings.  Most partici-
pants expressed the view that changes in the target range 
for the federal funds rate should be the primary means 
for adjusting the stance of monetary policy when the 
federal funds rate was above its effective lower bound.  
A number of participants indicated that the Committee 
should resume asset purchases only if substantially ad-
verse economic circumstances warranted greater mone-
tary policy accommodation than could be provided by 
lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower 
bound.  Moreover, it was noted that the Committee’s 
policy of maintaining reinvestments until normalization 
of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way 
had supported the smooth and effective conduct of 
monetary policy and had helped maintain accommoda-
tive financial conditions. 

Consistent with the Policy Normalization Principles and 
Plans, nearly all participants preferred that the timing of 
a change in reinvestment policy depend on an assess-
ment of economic and financial conditions.  Several par-
ticipants indicated that the timing should be based on a 
quantitative threshold or trigger tied to the target range 
for the federal funds rate.  Some other participants ex-
pressed the view that the timing should depend on a 
qualitative judgment about economic and financial con-
ditions.  Such a judgment would importantly encompass 
an assessment by the Committee of the risks to the out-
look, including the degree of confidence that evolving 
circumstances would not soon require a reversal in the 
direction of policy.  Taking these considerations into ac-
count, policymakers discussed the likely level of the fed-
eral funds rate when a change in the Committee’s rein-
vestment policy would be appropriate.  Provided that the 
economy continued to perform about as expected, most 
participants anticipated that gradual increases in the fed-
eral funds rate would continue and judged that a change 

to the Committee’s reinvestment policy would likely be 
appropriate later this year.  Many participants empha-
sized that reducing the size of the balance sheet should 
be conducted in a passive and predictable manner.  Some 
participants expressed the view that it might be appro-
priate for the Committee to restart reinvestments if the 
economy encountered significant adverse shocks that re-
quired a reduction in the target range for the federal 
funds rate.  

When the time comes to implement a change to rein-
vestment policy, participants generally preferred to 
phase out or cease reinvestments of both Treasury secu-
rities and agency MBS.  Policymakers also discussed the 
potential benefits and costs of approaches that would ei-
ther phase out or cease all at once reinvestments of prin-
cipal from these securities.  An approach that phased out 
reinvestments was seen as reducing the risks of trigger-
ing financial market volatility or of potentially sending 
misleading signals about the Committee’s policy inten-
tions while only modestly slowing reductions in the 
Committee’s securities holdings.  An approach that 
ended reinvestments all at once, however, was generally 
viewed as easier to communicate while allowing for 
somewhat swifter normalization of the size of the bal-
ance sheet.  To promote rapid normalization of the size 
and composition of the balance sheet, one participant 
preferred to set a minimum pace for reductions in MBS 
holdings and, if and when necessary, to sell MBS to 
maintain such a pace. 

Nearly all participants agreed that the Committee’s in-
tentions regarding reinvestment policy should be com-
municated to the public well in advance of an actual 
change.  It was noted that the Committee would con-
tinue its deliberations on reinvestment policy during up-
coming meetings and would release additional infor-
mation as it becomes available.  In that context, several 
participants indicated that, when the Committee an-
nounces its plans for a change to its reinvestment policy, 
it would be desirable to also provide more information 
to the public about the Committee’s expectations for the 
size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s assets and 
liabilities in the longer run. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the March 14–15 meeting 
suggested that the labor market strengthened further in 
January and February and that real gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) was continuing to expand in the first quarter, 
albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter, with 
some of the slowing likely reflecting transitory factors.  
The 12-month change in consumer prices moved up in

recent months and was close to the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent; excluding food and energy 
prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run 
somewhat below 2 percent. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a brisk 
pace in January and February.  The unemployment rate 
edged back down to 4.7 percent in February, and the la-
bor force participation rate rose over the first two 
months of the year.  The share of workers employed part 
time for economic reasons was little changed on net.  
The rate of private-sector job openings was unchanged 
at a high level in December, while the rate of hiring 
edged up and the rate of quits edged down.  The four-
week moving average of initial claims for unemployment 
insurance benefits was at a very low level in early March.  
Measures of labor compensation continued to rise at a 
moderate rate.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm 
business sector increased 3¼ percent over the four quar-
ters of 2016, and average hourly earnings for all employ-
ees increased 2¾ percent over the 12 months ending in 
February.  The unemployment rates for African Ameri-
cans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the lev-
els seen just before the most recent recession, but the 
unemployment rates for African Americans and for His-
panics remained above the rate for whites.  Over the past 
year or so, the jobless rate for African Americans moved 
lower, while the rates for Hispanics and for whites 
moved roughly sideways. 

Total industrial production declined in January, as un-
seasonably warm weather reduced the demand for heat-
ing, which held down the output of utilities.  Mining out-
put expanded further following a large gain in the fourth 
quarter, and manufacturing production continued to rise 
at a modest pace.  Automakers’ assembly schedules sug-
gested that motor vehicle production would remain near 
its January pace, on average, over the next few months, 
while broader indicators of manufacturing production, 
such as the new orders indexes from national and re-
gional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further modest 
gains in factory output over the near term. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to be rising at a slower pace in the first quarter 
than in the fourth quarter.  Motor vehicle sales stepped 
down in January and February from their brisk year-end 
pace, and unseasonably warm weather prompted a fur-
ther decline in consumer spending for energy services.  
Taken together, the components of the nominal retail 
sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to 
construct its estimate of PCE were unchanged in Febru-
ary after a robust gain in January.  Recent readings on 

some key factors that influence consumer spending—
including further gains in employment, real disposable 
personal income, and households’ net worth—were 
consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 
2017.  In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, re-
mained at an elevated level in February. 

Recent information on housing activity suggested that 
residential investment increased at a solid pace early in 
the year.  Starts for both new single-family homes and 
multifamily units strengthened in the fourth quarter and 
remained near those levels in January.  Issuance of build-
ing permits for new single-family homes—which tends 
to be a reliable indicator of the underlying trend in con-
struction—also moved up in the fourth quarter and re-
mained near that level in January.  Sales of existing 
homes rose in January, while new home sales maintained 
their fourth-quarter pace. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to be rising in the first quar-
ter after a moderate gain in the fourth quarter.  Nominal 
new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding air-
craft recorded a solid net gain over the three months 
ending in January, and indicators of business sentiment 
were upbeat.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresiden-
tial structures excluding drilling and mining was fairly flat 
in recent months, but the number of crude oil and natu-
ral gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to 
increase through early March.  The limited available data 
suggested that inventory investment was likely to make 
a smaller contribution to real GDP growth in the early 
part of the year than it did in the fourth quarter. 

Total real government purchases appeared to be moving 
sideways in the first quarter after having been little 
changed in the fourth quarter.  Nominal outlays for de-
fense in January and February pointed to an increase in 
real federal purchases.  Although state and local govern-
ment payrolls expanded in January and February, nomi-
nal construction spending by these governments fell 
sharply in January.  

Net exports exerted a significant drag on real GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the January 
trade data suggested that net exports would continue to 
weigh on growth in the first quarter of this year.  The 
U.S. international trade deficit widened in January in 
nominal terms, with imports—led by consumer 
goods—rising more than exports.  Over the past six 
months, nominal imports grew at a much faster 
pace than nominal exports.

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased a little less than 2 percent over the 
12 months ending in January.  Core PCE price inflation, 
which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 
1¾ percent over those same 12 months, held down in 
part by decreases in the prices of non­energy imports 
over part of this period.  Over the 12 months ending in 
February, total consumer prices as measured by the con-
sumer price index (CPI) rose 2¾ percent, while core CPI 
inflation was 2¼ percent.  The medians of survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations—such as 
those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Profes-
sional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little 
changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Foreign real GDP growth slowed a bit in the fourth 
quarter from a relatively strong rate in the third quarter, 
but it was still somewhat higher than its average pace 
over the past two years.  In much of the world, including 
Europe, Japan, and most of emerging Asia, economic 
activity continued to grow at a moderate pace.  In Can-
ada and Mexico—two important trading partners of the 
United States—growth stepped down from unusually 
strong third-quarter rates to a still-solid pace in the 
fourth quarter, and Brazil’s recession deepened.  Re-
cently released purchasing managers indexes and confi-
dence indicators from abroad were generally upbeat and 
pointed to continued moderate foreign growth in early 
2017, although indicators from Mexico suggested a fur-
ther slowing.  Inflation in the advanced foreign econo-
mies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting in-
creases in retail energy prices and currency depreciation.  
Among the emerging market economies (EMEs), infla-
tion rose in Mexico, in part reflecting a substantial hike 
in fuel prices, but fell in China and parts of South Amer-
ica.  

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Financial markets were generally quiet over the inter-
meeting period.  The Committee’s decision to keep the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the 
January–February FOMC meeting was well anticipated.  
Broad equity price indexes rose further, leaving some 
standard measures of valuations above historical norms.  
Treasury yields rose late in the intermeeting period, fol-
lowing monetary policy communications by several Fed-
eral Reserve officials.  The broad dollar index was about 
unchanged.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial busi-
nesses, households, and state and local governments re-
mained generally accommodative in recent months.   

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting 
period contributed to increased expectations of a deci-
sion to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at 
the March meeting.  The Chair’s semiannual monetary 
policy testimony reportedly led market participants to 
price in a slightly higher probability of a monetary policy 
firming in the near term.  Subsequently, investors took 
note of the mention in the minutes of the January– 
February FOMC meeting that many participants ex-
pressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the 
federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming infor-
mation on the labor market and inflation was in line with 
or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks 
of overshooting the Committee’s maximum- 
employment and inflation objectives increased.  Late in 
the period, communications from several Federal Re-
serve officials led to an increase in market-based 
measures of the probability that the target range for the 
federal funds rate would rise at the March meeting. 

Nominal Treasury yields increased over the intermeeting 
period, particularly for shorter maturities.  Treasury 
yields reacted only modestly over most of the period to 
domestic economic data releases that were reportedly 
seen as a little stronger than expected on balance.  Yields 
on longer-dated Treasury securities rose late in the pe-
riod following comments by Federal Reserve offi-
cials.  Measures of inflation compensation based on 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little 
changed, on net, since the February FOMC meeting. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the inter-
meeting period, and some measures of valuations, such 
as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical 
norms.  A standard measure of the equity risk premium 
edged lower, declining into the lower quartile of its his-
torical distribution of the previous three decades.  Stock 
prices rose across most industries, and equity prices for 
financial firms outperformed broader indexes.  Mean-
while, spreads of yields on bonds issued by nonfinancial 
corporations over those on comparable-maturity Treas-
ury securities were little changed.   

Since the previous FOMC meeting, better-than- 
expected economic data and earnings releases abroad 
also supported risk sentiment:  Foreign equity prices in-
creased, flows to emerging market mutual funds picked 
up, and emerging market bond spreads narrowed.  Con-
sistent with improved sentiment toward the EMEs, the 
dollar depreciated against EME currencies.  The Mexi-
can peso appreciated substantially against the dollar, al-
though it remained weaker than just before the U.S. elec-
tions.  In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the

AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in 
monetary policy expectations for the United States and 
AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe.  The 
broad dollar index was little changed over the period.  
Sovereign yields in AFEs generally increased slightly.  In 
the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and 
the pound weakened against the dollar in response to 
weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward 
revision by the Bank of England, at its early February 
policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack 
in the labor market.  As expected by market participants, 
the European Central Bank, at its meeting in early 
March, kept its policy rate and the pace of its asset pur-
chases unchanged.  

In U.S. financial markets, credit flows to large firms re-
mained solid in recent months, with strong bond issu-
ance by investment-grade corporations and brisk origi-
nations of leveraged loans.  Bank loans continued to be 
largely available for small businesses, although small 
business credit demand reportedly remained subdued.   

In the municipal bond market, issuance was strong in 
January but decreased somewhat in February.  Yields in-
creased a little, about in line with the rise in Treasury 
yields.  The number of ratings upgrades notably out-
paced the number of downgrades in January and Febru-
ary. 

Commercial real estate loans on banks’ books continued 
to grow in January and February.  Spreads on highly 
rated commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
over Treasury securities were little changed.  However, 
the volumes of CMBS issuance and of deals in the pipe-
line were lower in the first two months of the year than 
in each of the previous two years.  Market commentators 
attributed some of the slowdown to the response of is-
suers to risk retention rules that took effect in late 2016.  
The delinquency rate on loans in CMBS pools had risen 
since the spring of 2016, reflecting increased delinquen-
cies on loans originated before the financial crisis. 

Mortgage credit continued to be readily available for 
households with strong credit scores and documented 
incomes.  Despite the increase in Treasury yields, the in-
terest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was little 
changed over the intermeeting period.  Closed-end resi-
dential mortgage loans on banks’ books were about flat 
in January and February, while banks’ holdings of home 
equity lines of credit continued their long contraction.  
Financing conditions in the market for asset-backed se-
curities remained favorable.  Consumer credit continued 
to increase at a steady pace, with similar growth rates 
across credit card, automobile, and student loans.  The 

growth of consumer lending at banks continued in Jan-
uary and February, albeit at a slower pace than in the 
fourth quarter of 2016.  Financing conditions for con-
sumers remained accommodative except in the market 
for subprime credit card loans.   

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the March FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast 
for real GDP growth was a little weaker, on net, than in 
the previous projection.  Real GDP was expected to ex-
pand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the 
fourth quarter, reflecting some data for January that 
were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was pro-
jected to move back up in the second quarter.  The staff 
maintained its assumption—provisionally included start-
ing with the December 2016 forecast—of a more expan-
sionary fiscal policy in the coming years, but it pushed 
back the timing of when those policy changes were an-
ticipated to take effect.  The negative effect of this timing 
change on projected real GDP growth through 2019 was 
offset by a higher assumed path for equity prices and by 
a lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dol-
lar.  All told, the staff’s forecast for the level of real GDP 
at the end of 2019 was essentially unrevised from the 
previous forecast, and the staff continued to project that 
real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than 
potential output in 2017 through 2019.  The unemploy-
ment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through 
the end of 2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of 
its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemploy-
ment rate was little changed from the previous projec-
tion. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as 
measured by changes in the PCE price index, was un-
changed for 2017 as a whole and over the next couple of 
years.  The staff continued to project that inflation 
would increase gradually over this period, as food and 
energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy im-
ports, were expected to begin steadily rising this year.  
However, inflation was projected to be slightly below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to 
the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment 
that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to 
respond to large positive shocks to the economic out-
look than substantial adverse ones.  However, the staff 
viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced than 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

in the recent past, reflecting both somewhat diminished 
risks to the foreign outlook and an increase in U.S. con-
sumer and business confidence over recent months.  
Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, 
the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unem-
ployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks to the 
projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.  
The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term 
inflation expectations may have edged down or that the 
dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as 
roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation 
could increase more than expected in an economy that 
was projected to continue operating above its longer-run 
potential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.4  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.5  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these 
minutes.  

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had continued to expand at a moderate 
pace.  Job gains had remained solid and the unemploy-
ment rate was little changed in recent months.  House-
hold spending had continued to rise moderately while 
business fixed investment appeared to have firmed 
somewhat.  Inflation had increased in recent quarters 
and moved close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-

was little changed and had continued to run somewhat 
below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation

coming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is

compensation had remained low; survey-based measures 
of inflation compensation were little changed on bal-
ance.  

Participants generally saw the incoming economic infor-
mation as consistent, overall, with their expectations and 
indicated that their views about the economic outlook 
had changed little since the January–February FOMC 
meeting.  Although GDP appeared to be expanding rel-
atively slowly in the current quarter, that development 
seemed primarily to reflect temporary factors, possibly 
including residual seasonality.  Participants continued to 
anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a 
moderate pace, labor market conditions would 
strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabi-
lize around 2 percent over the medium term.   

Participants generally judged that risks to the economic 
outlook remained roughly balanced overall, although 
they saw some of the considerations underlying that as-
sessment as having changed modestly.  Participants con-
tinued to underscore the considerable uncertainty about 
the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal poli-
cies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on 
economic activity.  However, several participants now 
anticipated that meaningful fiscal stimulus would likely 
not begin until 2018.  In view of the substantial uncer-
tainty, about half of the participants did not incorporate 
explicit assumptions about fiscal policy in their projec-
tions.  Nonetheless, most participants continued to view 
the prospect of more expansionary fiscal policies as an 
upside risk to their economic forecasts.  At the same 
time, some participants and their business contacts saw 
downside risks to labor force and economic growth 
from possible changes to other government policies, 
such as those affecting immigration and trade.  Partici-
pants generally viewed the downside risks associated 
with the global economic outlook, particularly those re-
lated to the economic situation in China and Europe, as 
having diminished over recent months.  At the same 
time, several participants cautioned that upcoming elec-
tions in EU countries posed both near-term and longer-
term risks.   

Regarding the outlook for inflation, several participants 
noted that the apparently modest response of inflation 
to measures of resource slack in recent years, along with 

First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 
submitted economic projections.  
5 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate.

inflation expectations that appeared to have remained 
well anchored, limited the risk of a marked pickup in in-
flation as the labor market tightened further.  In contrast, 
some other participants continued to express concern 
that a substantial undershooting of the longer-run nor-
mal rate of unemployment, if it was to occur, posed a 
significant upside risk to inflation, in part because of the 
possibility that the behavior of inflation  could differ 
from that in recent decades.  Participants generally 
agreed that it would be appropriate to continue to closely 
monitor inflation indicators and global economic and fi-
nancial developments.      

In their discussion of developments in the household 
sector, participants agreed that consumer spending was 
likely to contribute significantly to economic growth this 
year.  Although motor vehicle sales had fallen early in 
the year and some other components of PCE had also 
declined, many participants suggested that the slowdown 
in consumer spending in January would likely be tempo-
rary.  The slowing appeared to mainly reflect transitory 
factors like lower energy consumption induced by warm 
weather or delays in processing income tax refunds.  In 
addition, conditions conducive to growth in consumer 
spending, such as a strong labor market or higher levels 
of household wealth, were expected to persist.  A num-
ber of participants also cited buoyant consumer confi-
dence as potentially supporting household expenditures, 
although some also mentioned that improved sentiment 
did not appear to have appreciably altered the trajectory 
of consumer spending so far.  In the housing market, 
access to mortgage credit that was still restricted for 
some borrowers, constraints on buildable land in some 
regions, and rising interest rates were cited as having 
continued to restrain the recovery in housing. 

Participants generally agreed that recent momentum in 
the business sector had been sustained over the inter-
meeting period.  Many reported that manufacturing ac-
tivity in their Districts had strengthened further, and re-
ports from the service sector were positive.  Business 
optimism remained elevated in a number of Districts.  A 
few participants reported increased capital expenditures 
by businesses in their Districts, but business contacts in 
several other Districts said they were waiting for more 
clarity about government policy initiatives before imple-
menting capital expansion plans.  Investment in oil drill-
ing, and particularly extraction from shale, was described 
as increasing in a couple of Districts, and demand for 
related production inputs was also said to be expanding.  
Nonetheless, slower economic growth, ample existing 
capacity, and modest returns in the energy sector were 

noted as factors that were continuing to restrain overall 
capital spending. 

Labor market conditions had continued to improve.  
Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment aver-
aged nearly 210,000 over the three months ending in 
February, the unemployment rate edged down, and the 
labor force participation rate ticked up.  Some partici-
pants cited anecdotal evidence of a tightening of labor 
markets.  Business contacts in many Districts reported 
difficulty recruiting qualified workers and indicated that 
they had to either offer higher wages or hire workers 
with lower qualifications than desired.  A couple of par-
ticipants reported that the ongoing mismatch between 
the skill requirements of available jobs and the qualifica-
tions of job applicants was a factor boosting the number 
of unfilled positions.  Tight labor markets were said to 
increasingly be a factor in businesses’ planning.  More 
employers reportedly were addressing the scarcity of la-
bor by expanding vocational programs, but contacts em-
phasized that, to be effective, such efforts needed to be 
complemented by other programs such as assistance 
with child care and transportation.  Shortages of produc-
tion crews were said to have restricted oil drilling in a 
couple of Districts.  In contrast, several other partici-
pants cited evidence that some slack remained in the la-
bor market, such as still-modest aggregate wage growth 
and the unevenness of wage gains across industries, an 
elevated share of employees working part time for eco-
nomic reasons, or other broad measures of labor un-
derutilization.  Participants noted the continued stability 
of the labor force participation rate in the face of its de-
mographically driven downward trend.  A few partici-
pants interpreted that development as suggesting that 
slack in the labor market was minimal.  A few others saw 
it as an indication that labor force participation could  in-
crease a bit more relative to trend and thus that some 
further reduction in labor market slack could occur.  
Most participants still expected that if economic growth 
stayed moderate, as they projected, the unemployment 
rate would remain only modestly below their estimates 
of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment over the 
next few years.  Some other participants, however, antic-
ipated a more substantial undershoot.    

Participants generally viewed the information received 
over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expec-
tation that inflation would stabilize around the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The  
12-month change in headline PCE prices increased from 
1.7 percent in December to 1.9 percent in January, as the 
effects of firmer consumer energy prices were registered.  
Core PCE prices rose at a relatively quick pace of 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

0.3 percent for the month of January, although it was 
noted that residual seasonality might have exaggerated 
the increase.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s  
12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate had gradu-
ally increased over the past couple of years, reaching 
1.9 percent in January.  Although market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had remained low, 
they were somewhat above the levels seen last year.  In 
addition, longer-term inflation expectations in the Mich-
igan survey had been relatively stable since the beginning 
of the year, while other survey measures of inflation ex-
pectations, such as the three-year-ahead measure from 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con-
sumer Expectations, had increased in recent months.  
Notwithstanding these developments, some participants 
cautioned that progress toward the Committee’s infla-
tion objective should not be overstated; they noted that 
inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during 
the current economic expansion and that core inflation 
on a 12-month basis was little changed in recent months 
at a level below 2 percent.  In contrast, a few other par-
ticipants commented that recent inflation data were 
stronger than they had expected and that they antici-
pated that inflation would reach the Committee’s objec-
tive of 2 percent this year. 

In their discussion of recent developments in financial 
markets, participants noted that financial conditions re-
mained accommodative despite the rise in longer-term 
interest rates in recent months and continued to support 
the expansion of economic activity.  Many participants 
discussed the implications of the rise in equity prices 
over the past few months, with several of them citing it 
as contributing to an easing of financial conditions.  A 
few participants attributed the recent equity price appre-
ciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to in-
creased risk tolerance among investors rather than to ex-
pectations of stronger economic growth.  Some partici-
pants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to stand-
ard valuation measures.  It was observed that prices of 
other risk assets, such as emerging market stocks, high-
yield corporate bonds, and commercial real estate, had 
also risen significantly in recent months.  In contrast, 
prices of farmland reportedly had edged lower, in part 
because low commodity prices continued to weigh on 
farm income.  Still, farmland valuations were said to re-
main quite high as gauged by standard benchmarks such 
as rent-to-price ratios. 

In their consideration of monetary policy, participants 
generally agreed that the data over the intermeeting pe-
riod were broadly in line with their expectations, provid-
ing evidence of further strengthening of labor market 

conditions and ongoing progress toward the Commit-
tee’s objective of 2 percent inflation.  Participants noted 
that their views of the economic outlook were essentially 
unchanged from those of the past couple of meetings.  
Almost all participants saw the incoming data as con-
sistent with an increase of 25 basis points in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  They 
judged that, even after an increase in the target range, the 
stance of monetary policy would remain accommoda-
tive, supporting some additional strengthening in labor 
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent 
inflation. 

With their views of the outlook for the economy little 
changed, participants generally continued to judge that a 
gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropri-
ate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  Participants 
pointed to several reasons for their assessment that a 
gradual removal of policy accommodation likely would 
be appropriate.  A few noted that it could take some time 
for inflation to rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis, and 
thus monetary policy would likely need to remain ac-
commodative for a while longer in order to support the 
economic conditions that would foster such an increase.  
Several participants remarked that risk-management 
considerations still argued for a gradual removal of ac-
commodation because the proximity of the federal funds 
rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on 
the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse 
shocks.  Moreover, the neutral real rate—defined as the 
real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor con-
tractionary when the economy is operating at or near its 
potential—still appeared to be low by historical stand-
ards.  Furthermore, uncertainty about current and pro-
spective values of the neutral real rate reinforced the ar-
gument for a gradual approach to removing monetary 
policy accommodation over the next few years. 

Participants emphasized that they stood ready to change 
their assessments of, and communications about, the ap-
propriate path for the federal funds rate in response to 
unanticipated developments.  They pointed to several 
risks that, if realized, could lead them to reassess their 
views of the appropriate policy path.  These risks in-
cluded the possibility of stronger spending by businesses 
and households as a result of improved sentiment, ap-
preciably more expansionary fiscal policy, or a more 
rapid buildup of inflationary pressures than anticipated.  
In addition, a number of participants remarked that re-
cent and prospective changes in financial conditions 
posed upside risks to their economic projections, to the 
extent that financial developments provided greater

stimulus to spending than currently anticipated, as well 
as downside risks to their economic projections if, for 
example, financial markets were to experience a signifi-
cant correction.  Participants also mentioned potential 
developments abroad that could have adverse implica-
tions for the U.S. economy.    

Nearly all participants judged that the U.S. economy was 
operating at or near maximum employment.  In contrast, 
participants held different views regarding prospects for 
the attainment of the Committee’s inflation goal.  A 
number of participants noted that core inflation was a 
useful indicator of future headline inflation, and the lat-
est reading on 12-month core inflation suggested that it 
could still be some time before headline inflation 
reached 2 percent on a sustained basis.  Moreover, sev-
eral participants remarked that even though inflation was 
currently not that far below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective, it was important for the Committee to remove 
accommodation gradually to help ensure that inflation 
would stabilize around that objective over the medium 
term.  These participants emphasized that a sustained re-
turn to 2 percent inflation was particularly important in 
light of the persistent shortfall of inflation from its ob-
jective over the past several years.  However, several 
other participants judged that—with the headline PCE 
price index rising nearly 2 percent and the core PCE in-
dex increasing close to 1¾ percent over the 12-month 
period ending in January—the Committee essentially 
had met its inflation goal or was poised to meet it later 
this year.  In the view of these participants, such circum-
stances could warrant a faster pace of scaling back ac-
commodation than implied by the medians of partici-
pants’ assessments in the SEP. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee’s previous meeting indicated that 
the labor market had continued to strengthen and that 
economic activity had continued to expand at a moder-
ate pace.  Job gains had remained solid, and the unem-
ployment rate had changed little in recent months.  
Household spending had continued to rise moderately, 
while business fixed investment appeared to have firmed 
somewhat.  

Inflation had increased in recent quarters, with the  
12-month change in the headline PCE price index rising 
to nearly 2 percent in January, close to the Committee’s 
longer-run objective.  However, nearly all members 
judged that the Committee had not yet achieved its ob-

jective for headline inflation on a sustained basis.  Mem-
bers generally viewed it as important to highlight that 
core inflation—which excludes volatile energy and food 
prices and historically has tended to be a good indicator 
of future headline inflation—was little changed and con-
tinued to run somewhat below 2 percent.  Moreover, 
market-based measures of inflation compensation had 
remained low.  

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market conditions would strengthen 
somewhat further.  It was noted that recent increases in 
consumer energy prices could cause inflation to tempo-
rarily reach or even rise a bit above 2 percent in the near 
term.  Members anticipated that inflation would stabilize 
around 2 percent over the medium term and com-
mented that transitory deviations above and below 
2 percent were to be expected.  Members continued to 
judge that there was significant uncertainty about the ef-
fects of possible changes in fiscal and other government 
policies but that near-term risks to the economic outlook 
appeared roughly balanced.  A few members noted that 
domestic upside risks may have increased somewhat in 
recent months, partly reflecting potential changes in fis-
cal policy, while some downside risks from abroad ap-
peared to have diminished.  Members agreed that they 
would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators 
and global economic and financial developments.  

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but 
one member agreed to raise the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent.  This increase was 
viewed as appropriate in light of the further progress that 
had been made toward the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Mem-
bers generally noted that the increase in the target range 
did not reflect changes in their assessments of the eco-
nomic outlook or the appropriate path of the federal 
funds rate, adding that the increase was consistent with 
the gradual pace of removal of accommodation that was 
anticipated in December, when the Committee last 
raised the target range.   

In the view of one member, it was premature to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  
That member preferred to await additional information 
on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market 
and increased evidence that inflation would stabilize at

the Committee’s objective before taking another step to 
remove monetary policy accommodation.   

Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This as-
sessment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  Partly in light of the likelihood that the recent 
higher readings on headline inflation had mostly re-
flected the temporary effect of increases in consumer en-
ergy prices, members agreed that the Committee would 
continue to carefully monitor actual and expected infla-
tion developments relative to its inflation goal.  A few 
members expressed the view that the Committee should 
avoid policy actions or communications that might be 
interpreted as suggesting that the Committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective was actually a ceiling.  Several mem-
bers observed that an explicit recognition in the state-
ment that the Committee’s inflation goal was symmetric 
could help support inflation expectations at a level con-
sistent with that goal, and it was noted that a symmetric 
inflation objective implied that the Committee would ad-
just the stance of monetary policy in response to infla-
tion that was either persistently above or persistently be-
low 2 percent.  Members also reiterated that they ex-
pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man-
ner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal 
funds rate.  They agreed that the federal funds rate was 
likely to remain, for some time, below levels expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  However, they noted that the 
actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on 
the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Members antic-
ipated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate was well under way.  They noted that 
this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 

following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective March 16, 2017, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of ¾ to 1 percent, including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 0.75 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per- 
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in February indicates 
that the labor market has continued to 
strengthen and that economic activity has con-
tinued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains 
remained solid and the unemployment rate was 
little changed in recent months.  Household 
spending has continued to rise moderately while 
business fixed investment appears to have 
firmed somewhat.  Inflation has increased in re-
cent quarters, moving close to the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective; excluding en-
ergy and food prices, inflation was little changed 
and continued to run somewhat below 2 per-
cent.  Market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation remain low; survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017 Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 
 

with gradual adjustments in the stance of mon-
etary policy, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace, labor market conditions will 
strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will 
stabilize around 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook 
appear roughly balanced.  The Committee con-
tinues to closely monitor inflation indicators 
and global economic and financial develop-
ments. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a sustained re-
turn to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-

                                                 
6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted 
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  This vote also en-
compassed approval by the Board of Governors of the estab-
lishment of a 1½ percent primary credit rate by the remaining 
Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of March 16, 
2017, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary 

backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Jerome H. 
Powell, and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  Neel Kashkari. 

Mr. Kashkari dissented because he preferred to maintain 
the existing target range for the federal funds rate at this 
meeting.  In his view, recent data had not pointed to fur-
ther progress on the Committee’s dual objectives and 
thus had not provided a compelling case to firm mone-
tary policy at this meeting.  He preferred to await addi-
tional information on the amount of slack remaining in 
the labor market and increased evidence that inflation 
would stabilize at the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
inflation objective before taking another step to remove 
monetary policy accommodation.  Mr. Kashkari also 
preferred that when data do support a removal of mon-
etary policy accommodation, the FOMC first publish a 
detailed plan to normalize its balance sheet before pro-
ceeding with further increases in the federal funds rate. 

To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to 
1 percent, effective March 16, 2017.  The Board of Gov-
ernors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percent-
age point increase in the primary credit rate (discount 
rate) to 1½ percent, effective March 16, 2017.6 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, May 2–3, 2017.  
The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on March 15, 2017.

quently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, St. Louis, 
and Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board 
of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary 
credit rate of 1½ percent, effective March 16, 2017.)  The sec-
ond vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the es-
tablishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal 
credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.

Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 14–15, 2017, meet-
ing participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2019 
and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection 
was based on information available at the time of the 
meeting, together with his or her assessment of appro-
priate monetary policy, including a path for the federal 
funds rate and its longer-run value, and assumptions 
about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.  
The longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the value to which each variable would be 
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to 
the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is de-
fined as the future path of policy that each participant 
deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic ac-
tivity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual 
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of 
maximum employment and stable prices. 

Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropri-
ate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) would run somewhat above their individual 
estimates of its longer-run rate this year and in 2018, 
while about half of the participants projected that eco-
nomic growth would slow in 2019 and run at or slightly 
below their individual longer-run estimates.  A substan-
tial majority of participants projected that the unemploy-
ment rate would run below their estimates of its longer-
run normal level in 2017 and remain below that level 
through 2019.  A large majority of participants projected 
that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent-
age change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE), would increase over the next two 
years; a majority of participants projected that inflation 
would be at the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2019, 
and all participants projected that inflation would be 
within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of the 
objective in that year.  Participants’ economic projec-
tions were generally quite similar to those submitted in 
December.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary sta-
tistics for the projections. 

                                                 
1 The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta was vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; the in-
coming president is scheduled to assume office on June 5, 
2017.  Marie Gooding, First Vice President of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Atlanta, submitted economic projections. 

As shown in figure 2, all but one participant expected 
that the evolution of economic conditions would likely 
warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to 
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  The medians of projections for the fed-
eral funds rate in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were essentially 
the same as those in the December Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections (SEP).  The median for 2019 was 
equal to the median of the longer-run projections.  How-
ever, the economic outlook is uncertain, and participants 
noted that their economic projections and assessments 
of appropriate monetary policy could change in response 
to incoming information. 

Most participants viewed the uncertainty attached to 
their projections as broadly similar to the average of the 
past 20 years, although some participants saw the uncer-
tainty associated with their forecasts as higher than aver-
age.  Most participants also judged the risks around their 
projections for economic growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as broadly balanced, while several par-
ticipants saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP 
growth and inflation as weighted to the upside and sev-
eral participants viewed the risks to their unemployment 
rate forecasts as tilted to the downside. 

Figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C for real GDP growth, the un-
employment rate, and inflation, respectively, present for 
the first time “fan charts” as well as charts of partici-
pants’ current qualitative assessments of the uncertainty 
and risks surrounding their economic projections.  The 
fan charts (the panels at the top of these three figures) 
show the medians of participants’ projections sur-
rounded by confidence intervals that are computed from 
the forecast errors of various private and government 
projections made over the past 20 years.  The width of 
the confidence interval for each variable at a given point 
provides a measure of forecast uncertainty at that hori-
zon.  For all three macroeconomic variables, these charts 
illustrate that forecast uncertainty is substantial and gen-
erally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.  Re-
flecting in part the uncertainty about the future evolution 
of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, 
participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy 
are also subject to considerable uncertainty.  To illustrate 

2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate.

the uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for mon-
etary policy, figure 5 shows a comparable fan chart 
around the medians of participants’ assessments for the 
federal funds rate.3  As with the macroeconomic varia-
bles, forecast uncertainty for short-term interest rates is 
substantial and increases as the horizon lengthens. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-
sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 
2.1 percent in 2017 and 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019; 
the median of projections for the longer-run normal rate 
of real GDP growth was 1.8 percent.  Compared with 
the December SEP, the medians of the forecasts for real 
GDP growth over the period from 2017 to 2019, as well 
as the median assessment of the longer-run growth rate, 
were mostly unchanged.  As in December, about half of 
the participants incorporated expectations of fiscal stim-
ulus into their projections; almost all in this group pro-
jected slightly higher real GDP growth next year relative 
to their December projections. 

The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.5 percent, unchanged 
from December and 0.2 percentage point below the me-
dian assessment of its longer-run normal level.  Almost 
all participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would not change much over the subsequent two years.  
Based on the median projections, the anticipated path of 
the unemployment rate for coming years was also un-
changed from the previous forecast.  The median esti-
mate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment 
was 4.7 percent, slightly lower than in December. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2017 to 2019 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections of real GDP 
growth for this year was less dispersed relative to the dis-
tribution of the December projections, while the distri-
bution for 2018 shifted up slightly.  The distributions of 
projections for the unemployment rate were unchanged 

                                                 
3 The fan chart for the federal funds rate provides a depiction 
of the uncertainty around the median assessment of the future 
path of appropriate monetary policy and is closely connected 
with the uncertainty about the future value of economic vari-
ables.  In contrast, the dot plot shown in figure 2 displays the 
dispersion of views across individual participants about the 
appropriate level of the federal funds rate. 
4 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were in-
formed by the view that there are multiple possible medium-

for 2017 and 2018, while they shifted slightly lower for 
2019 and for the longer-run normal rate. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
The medians of projections for headline PCE price in-
flation were 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018 
and 2019; these medians were unchanged from Decem-
ber.  Only a few participants saw inflation continuing to 
run below 2 percent in 2019, while several participants 
projected that inflation would run modestly above the 
Committee’s objective in that year.  The medians of pro-
jections for core inflation were 1.9 percent in 2017 and 
2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019, very similar to the contour 
in December.  

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  The distributions of projections for headline 
PCE price inflation were largely unchanged from De-
cember, while the distributions for core PCE price infla-
tion shifted up slightly.  Some participants attributed the 
upward shift in their projections for core inflation to re-
cent data that were somewhat above expectations. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint 
of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end 
of each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run.4  
The distributions for 2017 through 2019 shifted up 
modestly.  The median projections of the federal funds 
rate continued to show gradual increases, with the me-
dian assessment for 2017 standing at 1.38 percent, con-
sistent with three 25 basis point rate increases this year.  
Thereafter, the medians of the projections were 
2.13 percent at the end of 2018 and 3.00 percent at the 
end of 2019; the median of the longer-run projections of 
the federal funds rate was 3.00 percent.  Compared with 
the December SEP, the median of the projections for 
the federal funds rate rose only for 2019, and in that case 
just slightly. 

 

term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are per-
sistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way 
that cannot be forecast.  Under this view, the economy cur-
rently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic 
activity with low productivity growth and a low short-term real 
interest rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other 
than inflation cannot be usefully projected.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root

leased in the spring by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His-
torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance 
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington:  Board of

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  
Historical projections are the average level, in percent, in the fourth 
quarter of the year indicated. 

 
In discussing their March forecasts, many participants 
continued to express the view that the appropriate up-
ward trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next 
few years would likely be gradual.  That anticipated pace 
reflected a few factors, such as a short-term neutral real 
interest rate that was currently low and was expected to 
move up only slowly as well as a gradual return of infla-
tion to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  A few par-
ticipants indicated that positive news on inflation and 
the continued strengthening of labor market conditions 
in recent months had increased their confidence that in-
flation would move toward or to the 2 percent objective.  
Some participants judged that a slightly firmer path of 
monetary policy than in their previous projections would 
likely be appropriate.  Most of the participants who com-
mented on the Committee’s reinvestment policy antici-
pated that a change in that policy would be appropriate 
before the end of this year if the economic outlook 
evolved as projected. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
The economic projections of FOMC participants are 
generally subject to considerable uncertainty and risks, 

                                                 
5 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 

and, in assessing the path of appropriate monetary pol-
icy, FOMC participants take account of the range of 
possible outcomes, the likelihood of their occurring, and 
the potential benefits and costs to the economy should 
they occur.  Table 2 provides one measure of the fore-
cast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unem-
ployment rate, and total consumer price inflation—the 
root mean squared error (RMSE) for forecasts made 
over the past 20 years.  This measure of forecast uncer-
tainty is incorporated graphically in the top panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C, which display fan charts plotting 
the medians of participants’ projections for real GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and PCE price inflation 
surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived 
from the RMSEs presented in table 2.  If the degree of 
uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the 
typical magnitude of past forecast errors and if the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, then future 
outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 per-
cent probability of occurring within these confidence in-
tervals.  For all three variables, this measure of forecast 
uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the 
forecast horizon lengthens. 

FOMC participants may judge that the widths of the 
confidence intervals in the historical fan charts shown in 
figures 4.A through 4.C do not adequately capture their 
current assessments of the degree of uncertainty that 
surrounds their economic projections.  Participants’ as-
sessments of the current level of uncertainty surround-
ing their economic projections are shown in the bottom-
left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants 
continued to view the uncertainty attached to their eco-
nomic projections as broadly similar to the average of 
the past 20 years, with one fewer participant than in De-
cember seeing uncertainty about GDP growth, the un-
employment rate, and headline inflation as higher than 
its historical average.5  In their discussion of the uncer-
tainty attached to their current projections relative to lev-
els of uncertainty over the past 20 years, as in December, 
about half of the participants expressed the view that, at 
this point, uncertainty surrounding prospective changes 
in fiscal and other policies is very large or that there is 
not yet enough information to make reasonable assump-
tions about the timing, nature, and magnitude of the 
changes. 

The fan charts—which are symmetric around the me-
dian projections by assumption—also do not necessarily 

the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more
information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,
on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the
historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around
their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who
judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view
the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of
the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly
balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of

year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed
to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the
previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from
those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated
on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty
and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past
20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For
definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

reflect participants’ assessments of the balance of risks 
to their economic projections.  Participants’ assessments 
of the balance of risks to their economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, 
and 4.C.  As in December, most participants judged the 
risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as 
broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent 
with a symmetric fan chart.  One more participant saw 
the risks to unemployment as weighted to the downside 
than in December (the bottom-right panel of figure 4.B).  
The balance of risks to the inflation projection shifted 
up slightly relative to December, as one fewer participant 
judged the risks to both headline and core inflation as 
weighted to the downside and one more participant 
viewed the risks as weighted to the upside (the lower-
right panels of figure 4.C).  In discussing the balance of 
risks around their projections, some participants men-
tioned improvements in recent readings of household 
and business confidence as well as somewhat reduced 
risks from abroad.  Moreover, a number of participants 
noted that the possibility of a more expansionary U.S. 
fiscal policy might present upside risks to real GDP 
growth and inflation and downside risks to unemploy-
ment. 

Participants’ assessments of the future path of the fed-
eral funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are 
generally subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting 
in part uncertainty about the evolution of GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, and inflation over time.  The fi-

nal line in table 2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of 
short-term interest rates.  These RMSEs are not strictly 
consistent with participants’ projections of the federal 
funds rate, in part because these assessments are not 
forecasts of the likeliest outcomes but rather reflect each 
participant’s individual judgment of appropriate mone-
tary policy.  However, the associated confidence inter-
vals may provide a sense of the likely uncertainty around 
the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the 
uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well 
as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be 
appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the econ-
omy. 

Figure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the medians of par-
ticipants’ assessments of the appropriate path of the fed-
eral funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals de-
rived from the results presented in table 2.  As with the 
macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty is sub-
stantial and increases at longer horizons.  If at some 
point in the future the confidence interval around the 
federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would 
be truncated at zero for purposes of the chart shown in 
figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for 
the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Com-
mittee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a con-
vention and would not have any implication for possible 
future policy decisions regarding the use of negative in-
terest rates to provide additional monetary policy ac-
commodation if doing so were appropriate.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.4 to 4.6 percent in the current year, and 
0.9 to 5.1 percent in the second and third years.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, and 0.9 
to 3.1 percent in the second and third years.  Figures 4.A 
through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan 
charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of 
FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation.  However, in some instances, 
the risks around the projections may not be symmetric.  In 
particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; fur-
thermore, the risks around a particular projection might be 
tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the 
corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned 
around the median projection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
