By unanimous vote, the following officers of the Com-
mittee were selected to serve until the selection of their 
successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the 
Committee in 2016:

Thomas Laubach Secretary and Economist 
Matthew M. Luecke Deputy Secretary

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York was selected to execute transactions for the System 
Open Market Account (“SOMA”). 
 
By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Simon Pot-
ter and Lorie K. Logan to serve at the pleasure of the 
Committee as manager and deputy manager of the 

                                                 
6 Effective February 2, 2015. 
7 To improve consistency, references to “the FOMC,” “the 

Federal Open Market Committee,” and “the Committee” 
were standardized, where appropriate, around the con-
vention of “the Committee.”  This change was imple-
mented in other affected documents. 

SOMA, respectively, on the understanding that their se-
lection was subject to their being satisfactory to the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of New York. 
 

Secretary’s note:  Advice subsequently was re-
ceived that the manager and deputy manager 
selections indicated above were satisfactory to 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

 
By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic 
Open Market Operations was approved with two sets of 
amendments.  The first set of amendments aimed at sim-
plifying the language by defining common terms, elimi-
nating duplication of language, and standardizing refer-
ences to the Committee.7  The second set of amend-
ments clarified or modified existing authority, in partic-
ular by introducing the defined term “Selected Bank” as 
part of prudent planning to simplify transfer of authority 
from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to another 
Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee in the 
event of a significant contingency, removing the author-
ization to use agents for agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities (“MBS”) transactions, defining the types of collat-
eral accepted in securities lending operations described 
in paragraph 3, and updating the language relating to the 
Chair’s authority to act in exceptional circumstances.8  
The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market 
Operations in Federal-Agency Issues remained sus-
pended. 
 
AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN 
MARKET OPERATIONS 
(As amended effective January 27, 2015) 
 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to 
carry out the most recent domestic policy directive 
adopted by the Committee: 

A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that 
are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin-
cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities 
that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by, any agency of the United 

8 The change regarding the introduction of the term “Selected 
Bank” was implemented in other affected documents, in-
cluding the Authorization for Foreign Currency Opera-
tions, Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign 
Currency Operations, and Program for Security of 
FOMC Information. 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 27–28, 2015 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu-
rities”) for the System Open Market Account 
(“SOMA”): 

i. As an outright operation with securities dealers 
and foreign and international accounts maintained 
at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de-
livery basis (including such transactions as are com-
monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) 
at market prices; or 
ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or 
deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se-
curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo 
transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub-
ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo 
transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, 
at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the 
Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, 
after applying reasonable limitations on the volume 
of agreements with individual counterparties; 

B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma-
ture without replacement;  
C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection 
with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in 
the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible 
Securities that are direct obligations of the United 
States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the United States; and 
D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible 
Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United 
States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct 
obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed 
as to principal and interest by that agency. 

2. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graph 1 from time to time for the purpose of testing op-
erational readiness, subject to the following limitations: 

A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 2 
shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-
tee; 
B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au-
thorized in this paragraph 2 that are of the type de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.i shall not exceed $5 billion 
per calendar year; and 
C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.ii shall not exceed $5 billion 
at any given time. 

3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se-
lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu-
rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis 

(except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi-
ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). 

A. Such securities lending must be: 
i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; 
ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the 
objectives of the program; 
iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total 
amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that 
may be auctioned; and 
iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the 
amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower 
may borrow. 

B. The Selected Bank may: 
i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis-
cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a 
single issue;  
ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral 
for any loan of securities authorized in this para-
graph 3; and 
iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a 
loan of agency securities authorized in this para-
graph 3. 

4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, while assisting in the provision of 
short-term investments or other authorized services for 
foreign central bank and international accounts main-
tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac-
counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec-
tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the 
Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com-
mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on 
terms comparable to those available in the open market:  

A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake 
reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in 
the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 
65 business days or less; and 
B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus-
tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, 
when appropriate and subject to all other necessary 
authorization and approvals, to:  

i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi-
ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo 
transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus-
tomer Accounts; and  
ii. Undertake intraday reverse repo transactions 
in Eligible Securities with Foreign Accounts. 

Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un-
der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a 
service fee when appropriate.  Transactions undertaken 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori-
zation or approval of other entities, including the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when 
involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United 
States Department of the Treasury. 
5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the 
Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur-
ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to 
instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com-
mittee to: 

A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances 
the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that 
may result in material changes in the composition and 
size of the assets in the SOMA; or  
B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible 
Securities in order to appropriately address temporary 
disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature 
in U.S. dollar funding markets. 

Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of 
this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the 
Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of 
policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s 
long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and 
price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, 
and monetary developments since the most recent meet-
ing of the Committee.  The Chairman, whenever feasi-
ble, will consult with the Committee before making any 
instruction under this paragraph 5. 
 
The Committee voted to amend the Authorization for 
Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural In-
structions with Respect to Foreign Currency Opera-
tions, and to reaffirm the Foreign Currency Directive in 
the form shown below.  The approval of these docu-
ments included approval of the System’s warehousing 
agreement with the U.S. Treasury.  A change was made 
to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations 
to increase the duration limit of the foreign currency 
portfolio to 24 months from 18 months.  This change 
was made to provide greater flexibility in the manage-
ment of the foreign currency portfolio, in an environ-
ment in which interest rates are low in many major econ-
omies.  Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on the Author-
ization for Foreign Currency Operations and the For-
eign Currency Directive to indicate his opposition to for-
eign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve.  In 
his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did 
not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy; and 
if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compro-
mise the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independ-
ence. 

AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY 
OPERATIONS 
(As amended effective January 27, 2015) 
 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Mar-
ket Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the 
Committee’s foreign currency directive and express au-
thorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in 
conformity with such procedural instructions as the 
Committee may issue from time to time: 

A. To purchase and sell the following foreign cur-
rencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or 
forward transactions on the open market at home and 
abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, 
with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established 
by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with 
foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements, and with other international fi-
nancial institutions: 

 
Australian dollars 
Brazilian reais 
Canadian dollars 
Danish kroner 
euro 
Japanese yen 
Korean won 
Mexican pesos 
New Zealand dollars 
Norwegian kroner 
Pounds sterling 
Singapore dollars 
Swedish kronor 
Swiss francs 

 
B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for-
ward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign cur-
rencies listed in paragraph A above. 
C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign 
banks to draw dollars under the arrangements listed in 
paragraph 2 below, in accordance with the Procedural 
Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Oper-
ations. 
D. To maintain an overall open position in all for-
eign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this 
purpose, the overall open position in all foreign cur-
rencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net 
positions in individual currencies, excluding changes 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 27–28, 2015 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate move-
ments and interest accruals.  The net position in a sin-
gle foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances 
in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future 
receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future deliv-
ery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements 
with due regard to sign. 

2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to main-
tain for the System Open Market Account (subject to the 
requirements of section 214.5 of Regulation N, Rela-
tions with Foreign Banks and Bankers): 

A. Reciprocal currency arrangements with the fol-
lowing foreign banks: 
 
Foreign bank  Amount of arrangement 
    (millions of dollars equivalent) 
 
Bank of Canada  2,000 
Bank of Mexico  3,000 
 
B. Standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with 
the following foreign banks:  
 
Bank of Canada 
Bank of England 
Bank of Japan 
European Central Bank 
Swiss National Bank 
 
C. Standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrange-
ments with the following foreign banks:  
 
Bank of Canada 
Bank of England 
Bank of Japan 
European Central Bank 
Swiss National Bank 
 

Dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements 
have no pre-set size limits.  Any new swap arrangements 
shall be referred for review and approval to the Commit-
tee.  All swap arrangements are subject to annual review 
and approval by the Committee.  
3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken 
under paragraph 1.A above shall, unless otherwise ex-
pressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing 
market rates.  For the purpose of providing an invest-
ment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or 
for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or re-
ceived in connection with swap drawings, transactions 
with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-
market exchange rates. 

4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with for-
eign central banks for the coordination of foreign cur-
rency transactions.  In making operating arrangements 
with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign 
currencies, the Selected Bank shall not commit itself to 
maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the 
Committee.  Any agreements or understandings con-
cerning the administration of the accounts maintained 
by the Selected Bank with the foreign banks designated 
by the Board of Governors under section 214.5 of Reg-
ulation N shall be referred for review and approval to 
the Committee. 
5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to en-
sure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet antici-
pated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall 
generally have an average duration of no more than 24 
months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  Such invest-
ments may include buying or selling outright obligations 
of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a 
foreign government or agency thereof; buying such se-
curities under agreements for repurchase of such securi-
ties; selling such securities under agreements for the re-
sale of such securities; and holding various time and 
other deposit accounts at foreign institutions.  In addi-
tion, when appropriate in connection with arrangements 
to provide investment facilities for foreign currency 
holdings, U.S. government securities may be purchased 
from foreign central banks under agreements for repur-
chase of such securities within 30 calendar days. 
6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preced-
ing paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign 
Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) and the 
Committee.  The Subcommittee consists of the Chair-
man and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice 
Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other 
member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or 
in the absence of members of the Board serving on the 
Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the 
Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice 
Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman’s alter-
nate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at 
the request of any member, or at the request of the man-
ager, System Open Market Account (“manager”), for the 
purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated opera-
tions and of consulting with the manager on other mat-
ters relating to the manager’s responsibilities.  At the re-
quest of any member of the Subcommittee, questions 
arising from such reviews and consultations shall be re-
ferred for determination to the Committee. 
7. The Chairman is authorized: 

A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter 
into any needed agreement or understanding with the 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Secretary of the Treasury about the division of respon-
sibility for foreign currency operations between the 
System and the Treasury; 
B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully ad-
vised concerning System foreign currency operations, 
and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters re-
lating to foreign currency operations; 
C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re-
ports and information to the National Advisory Coun-
cil on International Monetary and Financial Policies. 

8. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the 
foreign currency operations for System Account in ac-
cordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Gover-
nors’ Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign 
Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 
1944. 
9. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graphs 1, 2, and 5, and foreign exchange and investment 
transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to 
undertake from time to time for the purpose of testing 
operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such 
transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar 
year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior 
notice to the Committee.

In conducting operations pursuant to the authoriza-
tion and direction of the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (the “Committee”) as set forth in the Authorization 
for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Cur-
rency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank selected by 
the Committee to execute open market transactions (the 
“Selected Bank”), through the manager, System Open 
Market Account (“manager”), shall be guided by the fol-
lowing procedural understandings with respect to con-
sultations and clearances with the Committee, the For-
eign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”), 
and the Chairman of the Committee, unless otherwise 
directed by the Committee.  All operations undertaken

thorized in paragraphs 2.A of the Authorization for 

Foreign Currency Operations: 

A. Drawings must be approved by the Subcom-

mittee (or by the Chairman, if the Chairman believes

of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the 

swap arrangement. 

B. Drawings must be approved by the Committee 
(or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-

not feasible in the time available, or by the Chair-
man, if the Chairman believes that consultation with 
the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time availa-
ble) if the swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank 
exceeds the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 per-

drawings by the System. 
D. Any changes in the terms of existing swap ar-

rangements shall be referred for review and ap-

proval to the Chairman.  The Chairman shall keep

in consultation with the Subcommittee.  The Chair-
man or the Subcommittee will consult with the 
Committee prior to the initial drawing on the dollar 
or foreign currency liquidity swap lines if possible 
under the circumstances then prevailing; authority 
to approve subsequent drawings for either the dollar 
or foreign currency liquidity swap lines may be del-
egated to the manager by the Chairman.  
B. Any changes in the terms of existing swap ar-
rangements shall be referred for review and ap-
proval to the Chairman.  The Chairman shall keep 
the Committee informed of any changes in terms, 
and the terms shall be consistent with principles dis-
cussed with and guidance provided by the Commit-
tee.  

3. Any operation must be approved by: 
A. The Subcommittee (or by the Chairman, if the 
Chairman believes that consultation with the Sub-
committee is not feasible in the time available) if it: 

i. Would result in a change in the System’s 
overall open position in foreign currencies ex-
ceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million 
since the most recent regular meeting of the Com-
mittee. 
ii. Would result in a change on any day in the 
System’s net position in a single foreign currency 
exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the 
operation is associated with repayment of swap 
drawings. 

iii. Might generate a substantial volume of trad-
ing in a particular currency by the System, even 
though the change in the System’s net position in 
that currency (as defined in paragraph 1.D of the 
Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations) 
might be less than the limits specified in 3.A.ii. 

B. The Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if 
the Subcommittee believes that consultation with 
the full Committee is not feasible in the time availa-
ble, or by the Chairman, if the Chairman believes 
that consultation with the Subcommittee is not fea-
sible in the time available) if it would result in a 
change in the System’s overall open position in for-
eign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most 
recent regular meeting of the Committee. 

4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graphs 1, 2, and 5 of the Authorization for Foreign 
Currency Operations and foreign exchange and in-
vestment transactions that it may be otherwise au-
thorized to undertake from time to time for the pur-
pose of testing operational readiness.  The aggregate 
amount of such transactions shall not exceed        
$2.5 billion per calendar year.  These transactions 
shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-
tee. 

 
By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Pro-
gram for Security of FOMC Information with changes 
to how Federal Reserve Banks classify and access Com-
mittee information. 
 
In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on 
Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, partic-
ipants generally agreed that only a minor update was re-
quired at this meeting.  Several participants observed 
that this statement had helped to increase public under-
standing of the Committee’s goals and policy frame-
work.  It was noted, however, that the Committee 
should continue to discuss possible enhancements to the 
statement over the coming year.   

Following the discussion, the Committee voted to reaf-
firm the statement with an updated reference to partici-
pants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemploy-
ment rate.  Mr. Tarullo abstained because he did not be-
lieve the statement reflects sufficient consensus in the 
principles underlying the Committee’s policy actions so 
as to significantly advance public understanding of its 
monetary policy strategy.

STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND 
MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY 
(As amended effective January 27, 2015) 
 

“The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is 
firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from 
the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta-
ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The 
Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci-
sions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity 
facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households 
and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer-
tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, 
and enhances transparency and accountability, which are 
essential in a democratic society.  

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates 
fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan-
cial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions 
tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  
Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions reflect its 
longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as-
sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the 
financial system that could impede the attainment of the 
Committee’s goals.  

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de-
termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee 
has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  
The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at 
the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change 
in the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the 
Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.  Communicating 
this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep  longer-
term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fos-
tering price stability and moderate long-term interest 
rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote 
maximum employment in the face of significant eco-
nomic disturbances. The maximum level of employment 
is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect 
the structure and dynamics of the labor market.  These 
factors may change over time and may not be directly 
measurable.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate 
to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Com-
mittee’s policy decisions must be informed by assess-
ments of the maximum level of employment, recogniz-
ing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and 
subject to revision.  The Committee considers a wide 
range of indicators in making these assessments.  Infor-
mation about Committee participants’ estimates of the 
longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem-
ployment is published four times per year in the 

FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.  For ex-
ample, in the most recent projections, FOMC partici-
pants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unem-
ployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.5 
percent.  

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to 
mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal 
and deviations of employment from the Committee’s as-
sessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are 
generally complementary.  However, under circum-
stances in which the Committee judges that the objec-
tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap-
proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag-
nitude of the deviations and the potentially different 
time horizons over which employment and inflation are 
projected to return to levels judged consistent with its 
mandate. 

The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles 
and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual 
organizational meeting each January.” 
 

Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
In a joint session of the Committee and the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager 
of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported 
on developments in domestic and foreign financial mar-
kets.  The deputy manager followed with a review of Sys-
tem open market operations conducted during the pe-
riod since the Committee met on December 16–17, 
2014.  The deputy manager also discussed the outcomes 
of recent tests of term and overnight reverse repurchase 
agreements (term RRPs and ON RRPs, respectively).  
These tests suggested that the combination of term RRP 
and ON RRP operations had been effective in support-
ing money market rates leading into and over year-end.  
The presentation also outlined some staff recommenda-
tions for further testing of Term Deposit Facility opera-
tions. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet-
ing period.  There were no intervention operations in 
foreign currencies for the System’s account over the in-
termeeting period. 

Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options 
A staff briefing provided some background on possible 
options for the use of supplementary tools, in addition 
to interest on excess reserves (IOER), that the Commit-
tee could choose to use during the early stages of policy 
normalization.  The purpose of these options was to 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 27–28, 2015 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



help ensure sufficient control over the federal funds rate 
and other short-term interest rates during this period 
while mitigating potential risks associated with particular 
policy tools.  The presentation discussed the possibility 
of establishing, on a temporary basis, an aggregate cap 
for ON RRP operations that was substantially above the 
cap the Committee had chosen for the purposes of test-
ing such operations.  In addition, the presentation dis-
cussed the possible use of term RRP operations, either 
before or after the commencement of policy firming, as 
a way to reinforce control of short-term interest rates 
and to manage the size of the ON RRP program.  Other 
possible options presented at the briefing included ad-
justing the values of the IOER and ON RRP rates asso-
ciated with a given target range for the federal funds rate 
and the use of term deposits.  

In their discussion of these issues, participants generally 
agreed that it was very important for the commencement 
of policy firming to proceed successfully.  Consequently, 
most were prepared to take the steps necessary to ensure 
that the federal funds rate traded within the target range 
established by the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC).  However, a few participants noted that day-
to-day volatility in the federal funds rate, potentially in-
cluding temporary movements outside the target range, 
would not be surprising, and that historical experience 
suggested that such temporary movements had few, if 
any, implications for overall financial conditions or the 
aggregate economy. 

With regard to the appropriate setting of the cap for ON 
RRP operations at the beginning of normalization, the 
staff reported that testing to date suggested that ON 
RRP operations have generally been successful in estab-
lishing a floor on the level of the federal funds effective 
rate and other short-term interest rates, as long as market 
participants judge that the aggregate cap is quite unlikely 
to bind.  Against this backdrop, most meeting partici-
pants indicated that a sizable ON RRP cap would be ap-
propriate to support policy implementation at the time 
of liftoff, and a couple of participants suggested that the 
aggregate cap might be suspended for a time.  A couple 
of participants expressed continued concerns about the 
potential risks to financial stability associated with a large 
ON RRP facility and the possible effect of such a facility 
on patterns of financial intermediation.  Moreover, some 
participants were concerned that a decision to allow a 
temporary increase in the maximum size of the ON RRP 
facility could be viewed by market participants as a signal 
that a large ON RRP facility would be maintained for a 
longer period than those participants deemed appropri-

ate.  While acknowledging these concerns, many partici-
pants believed that a temporarily elevated cap on the ON 
RRP operations at a time when the Committee saw con-
ditions as appropriate to begin normalization would 
likely pose limited risks; another participant judged that 
an ON RRP program was, in any case, unlikely to mate-
rially increase the risks to financial stability.  Some par-
ticipants noted that a relatively high cap could be estab-
lished and then reduced fairly soon after the initial policy 
firming if it was determined that it was not needed, and 
that such a reduction could help underscore the Com-
mittee’s intent to use such a facility only to the extent 
necessary.  A number of participants emphasized that 
the Committee should develop plans to ensure that such 
a facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once 
it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds 
rate. 

With regard to the possible use of term RRP operations 
as an additional supplementary tool, participants noted 
that recent testing showed that term RRP operations 
ahead of the year-end were associated with a significant 
decline in the level of take-up at ON RRP operations.  
The staff presentation suggested that risks to financial 
stability associated with term RRPs could be somewhat 
lower than those associated with ON RRP operations 
because term RRP operations would be conducted only 
on selected dates, the Federal Reserve would set the 
quantity auctioned, and the rate on term RRPs would be 
determined by the auction process.  However, a few par-
ticipants expressed the view that term RRPs were un-
likely to lower risks to financial stability significantly.  In 
addition, some participants noted that the use of term 
RRP operations could complicate communications.  A 
few others observed that the Committee should not de-
sign its operations to reduce year-end or quarter-end vol-
atility induced by financial firms’ reporting practices.  
Nonetheless, many participants agreed that the use of 
term RRP operations during the period of policy tight-
ening could be useful in some situations. 

With regard to the potential use of other tools, several 
participants noted that the IOER and ON RRP rates 
should be set at the top and bottom, respectively, of the 
target range for the federal funds rate.  To deviate from 
such a structure would complicate communications 
about the policy framework and therefore should be 
avoided if possible.   However, some participants judged 
that adjustments to the relationship of the IOER rate 
and the ON RRP rate to the target range for the federal 
funds rate might, in some circumstances, be helpful for 
improving control of the federal funds rate.  A few par-

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



ticipants noted that use of term deposits during the tight-
ening phase could also be appropriate in some circum-
stances.   

The staff presentation also discussed a technical issue re-
lated to the calculation of the payment of interest on re-
serves.  Under current arrangements, an increase in the 
IOER rate that is implemented in the middle of a reserve 
maintenance period is not fully reflected in interest pay-
ments to depository institutions until the beginning of a 
new maintenance period.  Participants generally sug-
gested that it would be useful for the staff to investigate 
changes in the method used to determine the interest 
payments on reserves that could tighten the link between 
the IOER rate in place each day and the level of reserve 
balances held by depository institutions each day. 

At the conclusion of their discussion, participants gen-
erally agreed that it would be useful to discuss further at 
coming meetings specific calibrations of policy tools that 
could be used during the early stages of policy normali-
zation.  In addition, many noted that it would be useful 
to communicate additional information to the public on 
these issues to provide greater clarity about the Commit-
tee’s approach to policy implementation at that time. 

A staff briefing outlined two proposals that the Commit-
tee could consider for further testing of term RRP oper-
ations.  In the first of these proposals, the Desk would 
conduct a series of preannounced term RRP operations 
that would span the end of the first quarter.  In the sec-
ond proposal, the Desk would conduct small term RRP 
operations in February and early March, in addition to 
the quarter-end option presented in the first pro-
posal.  In their discussion of term RRP testing, partici-
pants noted that the testing could provide further infor-
mation about the substitutability between the ON and 
term RRP operations, including outside year-end and 
quarter-end periods.  A number of participants empha-
sized that, even if the Committee conducted additional 
tests, it had not yet decided whether to use term RRP 
operations as part of policy normalization.  

Following the discussion of the testing of term RRP 
operations, the Committee approved the following 
resolution on term RRP testing over the end of the first 
quarter of 2015: 

“During the period of March 19, 2015, to 
March 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a se-
ries of term reverse repurchase operations in-

volving U.S. government securities.  Such op-
erations shall: (i) mature no later than April 9, 
2015; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of 
$200 billion outstanding at any one time;      
(iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five 
basis points above the ON RRP offering rate 
in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be 
awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest 
submitted rate if the sum of the bids received 
is less than or equal to the preannounced size 
of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, 
determined by evaluating bids in ascending 
order by submitted rate up to the point at 
which the total quantity of bids equals the pre-
announced size of the operation, with all bids 
below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out 
rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded 
on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counter-
party offers received is greater than the prean-
nounced size of the operation.  Such opera-
tions may be for forward settlement.  The Sys-
tem Open Market Account manager will in-
form the FOMC in advance of the terms of 
the planned operations.  The Chair must ap-
prove the terms of, timing of the announce-
ment of, and timing of the operations.  These 
operations shall be conducted in addition to 
the authorized overnight reverse repurchase 
agreements, which remain subject to a sepa-
rate overall size limit of $300 billion per day.” 

 
The Committee also approved the following resolution 
on testing term RRP operations during February and 
March: 
 

“During the period of February 12, 2015, to 
March 10, 2015, the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a se-
ries of term reverse repurchase operations in-
volving U.S. government securities.  Such op-
erations shall: (i) mature no later than      
March 12, 2015; (ii) be subject to an overall 
size limit of $50 billion outstanding at any one 
time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of 
five basis points above the ON RRP offering 
rate in effect on the day of the operation;     
(iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the 
highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids 
received is less than or equal to the prean-
nounced size of the operation, or (B) at the 
stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids

in ascending order by submitted rate up to the 
point at which the total quantity of bids equals 
the preannounced size of the operation, with 
all bids below this rate awarded in full at the 
stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate 
awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the 
counterparty offers received is greater than 
the preannounced size of the operation.  Such 
operations may be for forward settlement.  
The System Open Market Account manager 
will inform the FOMC in advance of the 
terms of the planned operations.  The Chair 
must approve the terms of, timing of the an-
nouncement of, and timing of the operations.  
These operations shall be conducted in addi-
tion to the authorized overnight reverse re-
purchase agreements, which remain subject to 
a separate overall size limit of $300 billion per 
day.” 

 
Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on both resolutions 
because he felt that the testing to date had already pro-
vided sufficient information about this tool, and that au-
thorizing further testing could encourage the incorrect 
impression that the Committee had already decided that 
it would be engaging in term RRP operations during the 
period of policy normalization. 

The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discus-
sion of liftoff tools and possible liftoff options. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation  
The information reviewed for the January 27–28 meet-
ing indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid 
pace over the second half of 2014, and that labor market 
conditions had again improved in recent months.  Con-
sumer price inflation moved further below the FOMC’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, held down by contin-
uing large decreases in energy prices.  While longer-term 
market-based measures of inflation compensation de-
clined substantially in recent months, survey measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in Decem-
ber and the gains for October and November were re-
vised up, putting the increase for the fourth quarter 
above that for the third quarter.  The unemployment rate 
declined to 5.6 percent in December, the labor force par-
ticipation rate decreased, and the employment-to-popu-
lation rate was unchanged.  The share of workers em-
ployed part time for economic reasons declined.  The 

rate of private-sector job openings moved up in Novem-
ber, while the rates of hiring and of quits edged down 
but remained well above their year-earlier readings. 

Industrial production rose at a robust pace in the fourth 
quarter, with a strong increase in manufacturing output 
and a modest gain in mining output.  Automakers’ as-
sembly schedules for the first quarter and broader indi-
cators of manufacturing production, such as the readings 
on new orders from national and regional manufacturing 
surveys, generally pointed to moderate gains in factory 
output early this year.  In contrast, some indicators of 
mining activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in opera-
tion, weakened, presumably reflecting the recent sharp 
declines in energy prices. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to have risen at a robust pace over the second 
half of 2014.  Data on spending in the third quarter were 
revised up, and the components of nominal retail sales 
used to construct estimates of PCE rose briskly in the 
fourth quarter.  Light motor vehicle sales in the fourth 
quarter maintained their robust third-quarter pace.  Im-
portant factors influencing household spending re-
mained supportive of further solid gains in real PCE 
early this year.  Real disposable personal income in-
creased in November; since then, continued declines in 
energy prices likely raised the purchasing power of 
households’ incomes.  Households’ net worth likely in-
creased as home values and equity prices advanced, and 
consumer sentiment, as measured by the Thomson Reu-
ters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, 
moved up in early January to its highest level in more 
than a decade. 

The pace of housing market activity improved some-
what but remained slow.  Starts of new single-family 
homes increased in December to their highest level since 
2008, and permits for new construction also moved 
higher.  Starts of multifamily units were unchanged in 
December and within the range they have been in for 
the past year.  Sales of new homes increased, on net, in 
November and December, while sales of existing homes 
declined, on average, over those two months. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to decelerate in the fourth 
quarter.  Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense 
capital goods, excluding aircraft, declined in November 
and December.  Moreover, the level of new orders for 
these capital goods was only a little above that for ship-
ments, which pointed to modest near-term gains in busi-
ness equipment spending despite relatively positive read-
ings on business conditions from national and regional 

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



surveys.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential 
structures edged down in November but remained 
higher than in the third quarter. 

Real federal government purchases appeared likely to 
have decreased sharply in the fourth quarter, reversing 
much of the surprisingly strong increase in the third 
quarter.  Real state and local government purchases were 
rising modestly in the fourth quarter, as nominal con-
struction expenditures for October and November were 
little changed, on net, and the payrolls of these govern-
ments increased somewhat.  

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substan-
tially in November, with imports declining more than 
exports.  The decrease in the value of imports stemmed 
in large part from a reduction in the value of petroleum 
imports, reflecting both lower prices and volumes.  
However, many other categories of goods imports were 
also weaker.  Export declines were concentrated in cap-
ital goods, particularly aircraft.  Despite the narrowing of 
the nominal trade deficit in November, real net exports 
appeared to be on track to decline in the fourth quarter 
after adding considerably to real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth in the third quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1¼ percent over the 12 months 
ending in November, while core prices, as measured by 
PCE prices excluding food and energy, rose about 
1½ percent; consumer energy prices declined, and con-
sumer food prices increased faster than overall prices.  
Over the 12 months ending in December, total inflation 
as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) was       
¾ percent, while core CPI inflation was 1½ percent.  
Over the 3 months ending in December, the total CPI 
decreased at an annual rate of 2½ percent, reflecting re-
cent declines in consumer energy prices, and the core 
CPI increased at a 1 percent pace.  Measures of expected 
long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including 
the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers, remained stable.  In contrast, market-based 
measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead 
declined further.  Over the 12 months ending in Decem-
ber, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees 
increased only slightly faster than core consumer price 
inflation. 

Foreign real GDP growth appeared to increase slightly 
in the fourth quarter.  In the euro area, retail sales, car 
registrations, and industrial production through Novem-
ber were above their third-quarter averages, and in Ja-
pan, strengthening consumption and exports suggested 
a recovery of output after two quarters of contraction.  

However, growth slowed in China, partly reflecting fur-
ther moderation in residential investment, and declining 
construction activity also contributed to slowing GDP 
growth in Korea and the United Kingdom.  Inflation in 
the advanced foreign economies declined sharply at the 
end of last year, amid rapidly falling energy prices.  By 
contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies fell 
only modestly, as several of these economies have      
government-administered energy prices and some have 
been experiencing upward price pressures from currency 
depreciations. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation  
Over the intermeeting period, amid trading that was vol-
atile at times, longer-term sovereign yields in the United 
States and other advanced economies declined.  These 
moves were attributed in part to a deterioration in mar-
ket sentiment associated with downward pressure on in-
flation, increased concern about the global economic 
outlook, and announced and anticipated foreign central 
bank policies.  Moreover, continued sharp declines in oil 
prices and U.S. economic data releases that were viewed 
by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on balance, 
reportedly weighed on sentiment. 

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting 
period were apparently seen as about in line with expec-
tations on balance.  However, reflecting in part the dete-
rioration in market sentiment, the expected path for the 
federal funds rate implied by market quotes shifted 
down.  Results from the Desk’s January Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers indicated that dealers continued to put the 
highest probability on scenarios in which the FOMC 
chooses to commence policy firming around the middle 
of the year, although the average probability assigned to 
a commencement after June increased somewhat. 

Yields on nominal Treasury securities continued to 
move lower over the intermeeting period, with market 
expectations of the policy rate path being revised down-
ward, and with term premiums declining, in part reflect-
ing actual and expected policy easing abroad.  On bal-
ance, the Treasury yield curve flattened over the inter-
meeting period, while interest rate volatility increased 
somewhat.  Although the measure of inflation compen-
sation over the next 5 years based on Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities (TIPS) increased, inflation compen-
sation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further to its lowest 
level in a decade.  Yields on 5- and 10-year TIPS moved 
lower over the period. 

Over the intermeeting period, U.S. equity markets were 
volatile.  Option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index 
declined, on balance, but remained in the upper half of 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 27–28, 2015 Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the range seen over the past year.  Broad U.S. equity 
price indexes moved higher, while stock prices for large 
domestic banking organizations moved lower on net.  
Corporate bond spreads were also volatile over the in-
termeeting period but were little changed, on net, for in-
vestment-grade issuers and ended the period lower for 
speculative-grade issuers, particularly energy companies. 

Credit flows to nonfinancial firms generally remained 
strong through the last quarter of 2014, though they 
slowed somewhat for riskier firms.  Gross corporate 
bond issuance continued to be solid, although specula-
tive-grade bond issuance declined late in the year and re-
mained subdued into January.  Commercial and indus-
trial loans on banks’ books continued to expand at a ro-
bust rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with 
the stronger loan demand from large and middle-market 
firms reported in the January Senior Loan Officer Opin-
ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS).  Issu-
ance of syndicated leveraged loans in the fourth quarter 
was at its slowest pace in two years, as spreads on newly 
issued loans increased and refinancing activity declined 
significantly.  Issuance of collateralized loan obligations 
declined but remained elevated; 2014 was the strongest 
year on record for the issuance of such securities.  

Financing conditions in the commercial real estate 
(CRE) sector stayed accommodative.  In the January 
SLOOS, banks reported that standards continued to 
ease, on net, for CRE lending and noted stronger de-
mand for all CRE loan types.  Issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities continued at a solid pace in 
November and December. 

Residential mortgage credit conditions, while remaining 
tight, showed some further signs of gradual easing.  Ac-
cording to the January SLOOS, lending standards eased 
for a number of categories of residential mortgage loans 
in the fourth quarter.  The price of mortgage credit for 
qualified borrowers declined again over the intermeeting 
period, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mort-
gages reaching levels close to their all-time lows.  Re-
finance applications rose near the end of the intermeet-
ing period. 

Conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely ac-
commodative over the intermeeting period.  Auto and 
student loan balances continued to post significant gains 
through November, while the expansion of credit card 
loans on banks’ books remained moderate during the 
fourth quarter as a whole.  Respondents to the January 
SLOOS indicated that demand for auto and credit card 
loans had strengthened further in the fourth quarter.  
Consumer credit quality has remained strong on balance.  

The credit performance of auto loans, however, report-
edly deteriorated a bit further for some lenders, and sev-
eral banks indicated in the January SLOOS that they ex-
pect the performance of subprime auto loans to worsen 
this year. 

The U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of 
most other advanced economies amid investor concerns 
about growth in those economies as well as increased 
monetary accommodation in some of them; the dollar 
was largely unchanged, on average, against the currencies 
of emerging market economies.  Sovereign yields abroad 
moved lower, with euro-area yields reflecting the ex-
pected and actual easing of the stance of monetary policy 
by the European Central Bank (ECB) and U.K. yields 
responding to a shift in expectations toward a later start 
of Bank of England policy firming.  Global equity mar-
kets were broadly higher, rebounding from declines in 
mid-December. 

Several central banks announced monetary policy ac-
tions during the period.  The ECB announced that it 
would expand its asset purchase program to include the 
purchase of sovereign bonds; the euro depreciated sig-
nificantly against the dollar both in anticipation of and 
following this announcement.  The Swiss National Bank 
(SNB) ended its policy of defending the exchange rate 
floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro, resulting in a signifi-
cant appreciation of the franc.  At the same time, the 
SNB reduced policy rates, moving the rate it pays on de-
posits and its target range for Swiss franc LIBOR, or 
London interbank offered rate, further into negative ter-
ritory.  The Bank of Canada, National Bank of Denmark, 
Reserve Bank of India, and Central Bank of Turkey also 
cut policy rates in January to support their economies 
and, in some cases, to foster higher inflation, while the 
Central Bank of Brazil raised rates in response to con-
cerns about elevated inflation.  

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability.  Relatively high levels of capital and 
liquidity in the banking sector, moderate levels of ma-
turity transformation in the financial sector, and a rela-
tively subdued pace of borrowing by the nonfinancial 
sector continued to be seen as important factors limiting 
the vulnerability of the financial system to adverse 
shocks.  However, the staff report noted valuation pres-
sures in some asset markets.  Such pressures were most 
notable in corporate debt markets, despite some easing 
in recent months.  In addition, valuation pressures ap-
pear to be building in the CRE sector, as indicated by 
rising prices and the easing in lending standards on CRE

loans.  Finally, the increased role of bond and loan mu-
tual funds, in conjunction with other factors, may have 
increased the risk that liquidity pressures could emerge 
in related markets if investor appetite for such assets 
wanes.  The effects on the largest banking firms of the 
sharp decline in oil prices and developments in foreign 
exchange markets appeared limited, although other in-
stitutions with more concentrated exposures could face 
strains if oil prices remain at current levels for a pro-
longed period.  

Staff Economic Outlook 
The staff estimated that real GDP growth in the second 
half of 2014 was faster than in the projection prepared 
for the December meeting, primarily reflecting stronger-
than-expected consumer spending.  Even so, real GDP 
was still estimated to have risen more slowly in the 
fourth quarter than in the third quarter, as changes in 
both net exports and federal government purchases ap-
peared likely to have subtracted from real GDP growth 
in the fourth quarter following large positive contribu-
tions in the previous quarter.   

The staff’s outlook for economic activity over the first 
half of 2015 was revised up since December, in part re-
flecting an anticipated boost to consumer spending from 
declines in energy prices.  However, the forecast for real 
GDP growth over the medium term was little revised, as 
the greater momentum implied by recent spending gains 
and the support to household spending from lower en-
ergy prices was about offset by the restraint implied by 
the recent appreciation of the dollar.  The staff contin-
ued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a mod-
estly faster pace in 2015 and 2016 than it did in 2014 and 
that it would rise more quickly than potential output, 
supported by increases in consumer and business confi-
dence and a pickup in foreign economic growth, as well 
as by a U.S. monetary policy stance that was assumed to 
remain highly accommodative for some time.  In 2017, 
real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing to-
ward, but to remain slightly above, the rate of growth of 
potential output.  The expansion in economic activity 
over the medium term was anticipated to lead to a slow 
reduction in resource slack, and the unemployment rate 
was expected to decline gradually and to move slightly 
below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate 
for a time.   

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was re-
vised down, as further sharp declines in crude oil prices 
since the December FOMC meeting pointed toward a 
somewhat larger transitory decrease in the total PCE 
price index early this year than was previously projected.  

In addition, the incoming data on consumer prices apart 
from those for energy showed a somewhat smaller rise 
than anticipated.  The staff’s forecast for inflation in 
2016 and 2017 was essentially unchanged, with inflation 
projected to remain below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective.  Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach 
2 percent over time, with inflation expectations in the 
longer run assumed to be consistent with the Commit-
tee’s objective and slack in labor and product markets 
anticipated to fade. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average over the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed 
as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff’s as-
sessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy 
was well positioned to help the economy withstand ad-
verse shocks.  At the same time, the staff viewed the risks 
around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly 
balanced.  The downside risks to the forecast for infla-
tion were seen as having increased somewhat, partly re-
flecting the recent soft monthly readings on core infla-
tion.   

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants regarded the information 
received over the intermeeting period as indicating that 
economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace.  
Although growth likely slowed from the rapid rate re-
corded for the third quarter of 2014, a variety of indica-
tors suggested that real GDP continued to grow faster 
than potential GDP late in the year and during January.  
Labor market conditions improved further, with strong 
job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants 
judged that the underutilization of labor resources was 
continuing to diminish.  Participants expected that, over 
the medium term, real economic activity would increase 
at a moderate pace sufficient to lead to further improve-
ments in labor market conditions toward levels con-
sistent with the Committee’s objective of maximum em-
ployment.  Inflation had declined further below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting de-
clines in energy prices, and was anticipated to decline 
further in the near term.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead had registered 
a further decline, while survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations remained stable.  Participants 
generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually 
toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective as the labor 
market improved further and the transitory effects of

lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.  The 
risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor 
market were seen as nearly balanced.  Participants gen-
erally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in en-
ergy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity 
and employment.  Many participants continued to judge 
that a deterioration in the foreign economic situation 
could pose downside risks to the outlook for U.S. eco-
nomic growth.  Several saw those risks as having dimin-
ished over the intermeeting period, with lower oil prices 
and actions of foreign central banks both being support-
ive of growth abroad, but others pointed to heightened 
geopolitical and other risks. 

With respect to the U.S. economy, participants noted 
that household spending was rising moderately.  Recent 
declines in oil prices, which had boosted household pur-
chasing power, were among the factors likely to under-
pin consumer spending in coming months; other factors 
cited as supporting household spending included low in-
terest rates, easing credit standards, and continued gains 
in employment and income.  However, it was noted that 
the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and 
that tepid nominal wage growth, if continued, could be-
come a significant restraining factor for household 
spending.  

Industry contacts pointed to generally solid business 
conditions, with businesses in many parts of the country 
continuing to express optimism about prospects for fur-
ther improvement in 2015.  Although manufacturing ac-
tivity appeared to have slowed somewhat over the inter-
meeting period in some regions, business contacts sug-
gested that this slowing was likely to prove temporary, 
and information from some parts of the country sug-
gested that capital investment was poised to pick up.  
Several participants noted that there were signs of layoffs 
in the oil and gas industries, and that persistently low en-
ergy prices might prompt a larger retrenchment of em-
ployment in these industries.  In addition, it was ob-
served that if capital investment in energy-producing in-
dustries slowed significantly, it could damp the overall 
expansion of economic activity for a period, especially if 
the slowing took place after most of the positive effects 
of lower energy prices on growth in household spending 
had occurred.  A few participants observed that govern-
ment spending was unlikely to be a major contributor to 
the expansion of demand in the period ahead, with real 
federal purchases projected to be fairly flat over the me-
dium term. 

In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, par-
ticipants noted that a number of developments over the 

intermeeting period had likely reduced the risks to U.S. 
growth.  Accommodative policy actions announced by a 
number of foreign central banks had likely strengthened 
the outlook abroad.  The decline in energy prices was 
also seen as potentially exerting a stronger-than-antici-
pated positive effect on growth in the domestic econ-
omy and abroad.  However, the increase in the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar was expected to be a persis-
tent source of restraint on U.S. net exports, and a few 
participants pointed to the risk that the dollar could ap-
preciate further.  In addition, the slowdown of growth in 
China was noted as a factor restraining economic expan-
sion in a number of countries, and several continuing 
risks to the international economic outlook were cited, 
including global disinflationary pressure, tensions in the 
Middle East and Ukraine, and financial uncertainty in 
Greece.  Overall, the risks to the outlook for U.S. eco-
nomic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly 
balanced. 

Participants noted that inflation had moved further be-
low the Committee’s longer-run objective, largely re-
flecting declines in energy prices and other transitory 
factors.  A number of participants observed that, with 
anchored inflation expectations, the fall in energy prices 
should not leave an enduring imprint on aggregate infla-
tion.  It was pointed out that the recent intensification 
of downward pressure on inflation reflected price move-
ments that were concentrated in a narrow range of items 
in households’ consumption basket, a pattern borne out 
by trimmed mean measures of inflation.  Several partici-
pants remarked that inflation measures that excluded en-
ergy items had also moved down in recent months, but 
these declines partly reflected transitory factors, includ-
ing downward pressure on import prices and the pass-
through of lower energy costs to the prices of  non-      
energy items.  Nonetheless, several participants saw the 
continuing weakness of core inflation measures as a con-
cern.  In addition, a few participants suggested that the 
weakness of nominal wage growth indicated that core 
and headline inflation could take longer to return to         
2 percent than the Committee anticipated.  In contrast, 
a couple of participants suggested that nominal wage 
growth provides little information about the future be-
havior of price inflation.  Participants also discussed the 
possibility that, because of the infrequent occurrence of 
reductions in nominal wages, wages may not have fully 
adjusted downward in the period of high unemploy-
ment, and therefore pent-up wage deflation might have 
weighed on wage gains for a time during the expansion.  
If this was the case, nominal wage growth could be ex-
pected to pick up in coming periods and to resume a 

Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



more normal relationship with labor market slack.  Most 
participants expected that continuing reductions in re-
source slack would be helpful in returning inflation over 
the medium term to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-
run objective, but a few participants voiced concern that 
nominal wage growth might rise rapidly and inflation 
might exceed 2 percent for a time. 

Participants discussed the sizable decline in market-
based measures of inflation compensation that had been 
observed over the past year and continued over the in-
termeeting period.  A number of them judged that the 
decline mostly reflected a reduction in the risk premiums 
embedded in nominal interest rates rather than a decline 
in inflation expectations; this interpretation was sup-
ported by results of some analytical models used to de-
compose movements in market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation and also by the continuing stability 
of survey-based measures of inflation expectations.  
However, other participants put some weight on the 
possibility that the decline in inflation compensation re-
flected a reduction in expected inflation.  These partici-
pants further argued that the stability of survey-based 
measures of inflation expectations should not be taken 
as providing much reassurance; in particular, it was 
noted that in Japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s, 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions had not recorded major declines even as a disinfla-
tionary process had become entrenched.  In addition, a 
few participants argued that even if the shift down in in-
flation compensation reflected lower inflation risk pre-
miums rather than reductions in expected inflation, pol-
icymakers might still want to take that decline into ac-
count because it could reflect increased concern on the 
part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low 
inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity.  
Participants generally agreed that the behavior of       
market-based measures of inflation compensation 
needed to be monitored closely. 

Participants also discussed other aspects of the substan-
tial decline in nominal longer-term interest rates and its 
implications. The fall had occurred despite the strength-
ening U.S. economic outlook and market expectations 
that policy normalization could begin later this year.  
Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from 
abroad into U.S. Treasury securities may have put down-
ward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may 
have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign 
sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated 
monetary policy actions abroad.  A couple of partici-
pants noted that the reduction in longer-term real inter-
est rates tended to make U.S. financial conditions more 

accommodative, potentially calling for a somewhat 
higher path for the federal funds rate going forward.  
Others observed that insofar as the shifts reflected con-
cerns about growth prospects abroad or were accompa-
nied by a stronger dollar, the implications for U.S. mon-
etary policy were less clear.  It was further noted that 
investment flows from abroad could also be contrib-
uting to the decline in TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation, as such flows tend to be concentrated in 
nominal Treasury securities rather than inflation-        
protected securities. 

Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor 
market conditions over the intermeeting period, includ-
ing strong gains in payroll employment and a further re-
duction in the unemployment rate.  Some participants 
believed that considerable labor market slack remained, 
especially when indicators other than the unemployment 
rate were taken into account, including the unusually 
large fraction of the labor force working part time for 
economic reasons.  A few observed that the combina-
tion of recent labor market improvements and contin-
ued softness in inflation had led them to lower their es-
timates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  
However, a few others saw only a limited degree of re-
maining labor underutilization or anticipated that un-
derutilization would be eliminated relatively soon.  

Participants’ Discussion of Policy Planning 
Participants discussed considerations related to the 
choice of the appropriate timing of the initial firming in 
monetary policy and pace of subsequent rate increases.  
Ahead of this discussion, the staff gave a presentation 
that outlined some of the key issues likely to be involved, 
including the extent to which similar economic out-
comes could be generated by different combinations of 
the date of the initial firming of policy and the pace of 
rate increases thereafter, how these combinations could 
affect the risks to economic outcomes, a review of past 
episodes in the United States and abroad in which mon-
etary policy transitioned to a tightening phase after a 
lengthy period of low policy rates, and issues related to 
communications regarding the likely timing and pace of 
normalization. 

Participants discussed the tradeoffs between the risks 
that would be associated with departing from the effec-
tive lower bound later and those that would be associ-
ated with departing earlier.  Several participants noted 
that a late departure could result in the stance of mone-
tary policy becoming excessively accommodative, lead-
ing to undesirably high inflation.  It was also suggested 
that maintaining the federal funds rate at its effective 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 27–28, 2015 Page 17_____________________________________________________________________________________________



lower bound for an extended period or raising it rapidly, 
if that proved necessary, could adversely affect financial 
stability.  Some participants were concerned that a deci-
sion to delay the commencement of tightening could be 
perceived as indicating that an overly accommodative 
policy is likely to prevail during the firming phase.  In 
connection with the risks associated with an early start 
to policy normalization, many participants observed that 
a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent 
solid recovery in real activity and labor market condi-
tions, undermining progress toward the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  In addition, an earlier tightening would increase 
the likelihood that the Committee might be forced by 
adverse economic outcomes to return the federal funds 
rate to its effective lower bound.  Some participants 
noted the communications challenges associated with 
the prospect of commencing policy tightening at a time 
when inflation could be running well below 2 percent, 
and a few expressed concern that in some circumstances 
the public could come to question the credibility of the 
Committee’s 2 percent goal.  Indeed, one participant rec-
ommended that, in light of the outlook for inflation, the 
Committee consider ways to use its tools to provide 
more, not less, accommodation. 

Many participants indicated that their assessment of the 
balance of risks associated with the timing of the begin-
ning of policy normalization had inclined them toward 
keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower 
bound for a longer time.  Some observed that, even with 
these risks taken into consideration, the federal funds 
rate may have already been kept at its lower bound for a 
sufficient length of time, and that it might be appropriate 
to begin policy firming in the near term.  Regardless of 
the particular strategy undertaken, it was noted that, pro-
vided that the data-dependent nature of the path for the 
federal funds rate after its initial increase could be com-
municated to financial markets and the general public in 
an effective manner, the precise date at which firming 
commenced would have a less important bearing on eco-
nomic outcomes. 

Participants discussed the economic conditions that they 
anticipate will prevail at the time they expect it will be 
appropriate to begin normalizing policy.  There was wide 
agreement that it would be difficult to specify in advance 
an exhaustive list of economic indicators and the values 
that these indicators would need to take.  Nonetheless, a 
number of participants suggested that they would need 
to see further improvement in labor market conditions 
and data pointing to continued growth in real activity at 
a pace sufficient to support additional labor market gains 

before beginning policy normalization.  Many partici-
pants indicated that such economic conditions would 
help bolster their confidence in the likelihood of infla-
tion moving toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
after the transitory effects of lower energy prices and 
other factors dissipate.  Some participants noted that 
their confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent 
would also be bolstered by stable or rising levels of core 
PCE inflation, or of alternative series, such as trimmed 
mean or median measures of inflation.  A number of 
participants emphasized that they would need to see ei-
ther an increase in market-based measures of inflation 
compensation or evidence that continued low readings 
on these measures did not constitute grounds for con-
cern.  Several participants indicated that signs of im-
provements in labor compensation would be an im-
portant signal, while a few others deemphasized the 
value of labor compensation data for judging incipient 
inflation pressures in light of the loose short-run empir-
ical connection between wage and price inflation. 

Participants discussed the communications challenges 
associated with signaling, when it becomes appropriate 
to do so, that policy normalization is likely to begin rel-
atively soon while remaining clear that the Committee’s 
actions would depend on incoming data.  Many partici-
pants regarded dropping the “patient” language in the 
statement, whenever that might occur, as risking a shift 
in market expectations for the beginning of policy firm-
ing toward an unduly narrow range of dates.  As a result, 
some expressed the concern that financial markets might 
overreact, resulting in undesirably tight financial condi-
tions.  Participants discussed some possible communica-
tions by which they might further underscore the data 
dependency of their decision regarding when to tighten 
the stance of monetary policy.  A number of participants 
noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful 
tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, 
as the start of normalization approaches, there would be 
limits to the specificity that the Committee could pro-
vide about its timing.  Looking ahead, some participants 
highlighted the potential benefits of streamlining the 
Committee’s postmeeting statement once normalization 
has begun.  More broadly, it was suggested that the 
Committee should communicate clearly that policy deci-
sions will be data dependent, and that unanticipated eco-
nomic developments could therefore warrant a path of 
the federal funds rate different from that currently ex-
pected by investors or policymakers. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 

Page 18 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the FOMC met in December indicated that economic 
activity had been expanding at a solid pace.  Labor mar-
ket conditions had improved further, with strong job 
gains and a lower unemployment rate; numerous labor 
market indicators suggested that the underutilization of 
labor resources was continuing to diminish.  Household 
spending was rising moderately; recent declines in en-
ergy prices had boosted household purchasing power.  
Business fixed investment was advancing, while the re-
covery in the housing sector remained slow.  Inflation 
had declined further below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and 
was expected to decline further in the near term.        
Market-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward 
inflation compensation had declined substantially in re-
cent months, but survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations had remained stable.  The Com-
mittee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy 
accommodation, economic activity would continue to 
expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators 
moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent 
with its dual mandate.  The Committee also expected 
that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as 
the labor market improves further and the transitory ef-
fects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  
In view of the uncertainties about the inflation outlook, 
the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 

In their discussion of language for the postmeeting state-
ment, members generally agreed that they should 
acknowledge the solid growth over the second half of 
2014 as well as the further improvement in labor market 
conditions over the intermeeting period.  Job gains had 
been strong, and the Committee judged that labor mar-
ket slack continued to diminish.  In addition, members 
decided that the statement should note the further de-
cline of inflation seen of late and the additional decline 
that was in prospect in the near term, while also register-
ing their judgment that these short-term movements of 
inflation largely reflected the recent decline in energy 
prices and other transitory factors, and that inflation was 
likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Members also agreed that it was appropriate to 
observe that lower energy prices had boosted household 
purchasing power.  The Committee further decided that 
the postmeeting statement should explicitly 
acknowledge the role of international developments as 
one of the factors influencing the Committee’s assess-
ment of progress toward its objectives of maximum em-
ployment and 2 percent inflation.   

The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm 
the indication in the statement that the Committee’s de-
cision about how long to maintain the current target 
range for the federal funds rate would depend on its as-
sessment of actual and expected progress toward its ob-
jectives of maximum employment and 2 percent infla-
tion.  Members agreed to continue to include, in the for-
ward guidance, language indicating that the Committee 
judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize 
the stance of monetary policy.  Members agreed that 
their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and 
they continued to include wording in the statement    
noting that if incoming information indicates faster pro-
gress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation 
objectives than the Committee now expects, then in-
creases in the target range for the federal funds rate 
would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, 
and, conversely, that if progress proves slower than ex-
pected, then increases in the target range would likely 
occur later than currently anticipated.  The Committee 
decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-
ties at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s 
holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, 
should help maintain accommodative financial condi-
tions.  Finally, the Committee also decided to reiterate 
its expectation that, even after employment and inflation 
are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal 
funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal 
in the longer run. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to       
¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk 
to undertake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain such conditions.  The 
Committee directs the Desk to maintain its 
policy of rolling over maturing Treasury

securities into new issues and its policy of 
reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities 
in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in 
dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the 
Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.  The System Open 
Market Account manager and the secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 
sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

  
The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in December suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding at 
a solid pace.  Labor market conditions have 
improved further, with strong job gains and a 
lower unemployment rate.  On balance, a 
range of labor market indicators suggests that 
underutilization of labor resources continues 
to diminish.  Household spending is rising 
moderately; recent declines in energy prices 
have boosted household purchasing power.  
Business fixed investment is advancing, while 
the recovery in the housing sector remains 
slow.  Inflation has declined further below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, largely re-
flecting declines in energy prices.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation 
have declined substantially in recent months; 
survey-based measures of longer-term infla-
tion expectations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  The Committee ex-
pects that, with appropriate policy accommo-
dation, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace, with labor market indicators 
continuing to move toward levels the Com-
mittee judges consistent with its dual man-
date.  The Committee continues to see the 
risks to the outlook for economic activity and 
the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation 
is anticipated to decline further in the near 

term, but the Committee expects inflation to 
rise gradually toward 2 percent over the me-
dium term as the labor market improves fur-
ther and the transitory effects of lower energy 
prices and other factors dissipate.  The Com-
mittee continues to monitor inflation devel-
opments closely. 

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that the 
current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In de-
termining how long to maintain this target 
range, the Committee will assess progress—
both realized and expected—toward its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indica-
tors of inflation pressures and inflation expec-
tations, and readings on financial and interna-
tional developments.  Based on its current as-
sessment, the Committee judges that it can be 
patient in beginning to normalize the stance 
of monetary policy.  However, if incoming in-
formation indicates faster progress toward the 
Committee’s employment and inflation objec-

levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run.”
