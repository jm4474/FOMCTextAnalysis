Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and 
Communication Practices  
Committee participants continued their discussions re-
lated to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's 
monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication 
practices.  Staff briefings provided an assessment of a 
range of monetary policy tools that the Committee could 
employ to provide additional economic stimulus and 
bolster inflation outcomes, particularly in future epi-
sodes in which the policy rate would be constrained by 
the effective lower bound (ELB).  The staff first dis-
cussed policy rate tools, focusing on three forms of for-
ward guidance—qualitative, which provides a nonspe-
cific indication of the expected duration of accommoda-
tion; date-based, which specifies a date beyond which 
accommodation could start to be reduced; and outcome-
based, which ties the possible start of a reduction of ac-
commodation to the achievement of certain macroeco-
nomic outcomes.  The briefing addressed communica-
tions challenges associated with each form of forward 
guidance, including the need to avoid conveying a more 
negative economic outlook than the FOMC expects.  
Nonetheless, the staff suggested that forward guidance 
generally had been effective in easing financial condi-
tions and stimulating economic activity in circumstances 
when the policy rate was above the ELB and when it was 
at the ELB.  The briefing also discussed negative interest 
rates, a policy option implemented by several foreign 
central banks.  The staff noted that although the evi-
dence so far suggested that this tool had provided ac-
commodation in jurisdictions where it had been em-
ployed, there were also indications of possible adverse 
side effects.  Moreover, differences between the U.S. fi-
nancial system and the financial systems of those juris-
dictions suggested that the foreign experience may not 
provide a useful guide in assessing whether negative 
rates would be effective in the United States. 

The second part of the staff briefing focused on balance 
sheet policy tools.  The staff discussed the benefits and 
costs associated with the large-scale asset purchase pro-
grams implemented by the Federal Reserve after the fi-
nancial crisis.  In general, the staff’s review of the histor-
ical experience suggested that the benefits of large-scale 
asset purchase programs were significant and that many 
of the potential costs of such programs identified at the 
time either did not materialize or materialized to a 
smaller degree than initially feared.  In addition, the staff 
presentation noted that—taking account of investor ex-
pectations ahead of the announcement of each new pro-
gram—the effects of asset purchases did not appear to 
have diminished materially across consecutive programs.  

However, going forward, such policies might not be as 
effective because longer-term interest rates would likely 
be much lower at the onset of a future asset purchase 
program than they were before the financial crisis.  The 
staff also compared the benefits and costs associated 
with asset purchase programs that are of a fixed cumu-
lative size and those that are flow-based—where pur-
chases continue  at a specific pace until certain macroe-
conomic outcomes are achieved—and examined the po-
tential effectiveness of using asset purchases to place 
ceilings on interest rates.  The briefing also discussed 
lending programs that could facilitate the flow of credit 
to households or businesses.   

Participants discussed the relative merits of qualitative, 
date-based, and outcome-based forward guidance.  A 
number of participants noted that each of these three 
forms of forward guidance could be effective in provid-
ing accommodation, depending on circumstances both 
at and away from the ELB.  They also suggested that 
different types of forward guidance would likely be 
needed to address varying economic conditions, and that 
the communications regarding forward guidance needed 
to be tailored to explain the Committee’s evaluation of 
the economic outlook.  In particular, several participants 
emphasized that to guard against the possibility of ad-
verse feedback loops in which forward guidance is inter-
preted by the public as a sign of a sharply deteriorating 
economic outlook, thus leading households and busi-
nesses to become even more cautious in their spending 
decisions, the Committee would need to clearly com-
municate how its announced policy could help promote 
better economic outcomes.  Participants saw both ben-
efits and costs associated with outcome-based forward 
guidance relative to other forms of forward guidance.  
On the one hand, relative to qualitative or date-based 
forward guidance, outcome-based forward guidance has 
the advantage of creating an explicit link between future 
monetary policy actions and macroeconomic conditions, 
thereby helping to support economic stabilization ef-
forts and foster transparency and accountability.  On the 
other hand, outcome-based forward guidance could be 
complex and difficult to explain and, hence, could po-
tentially be less effective than qualitative or date-based 
forward guidance if those hurdles could not be over-
come.  A few participants commented that outcome-
based forward guidance, tied to inflation outcomes, 
could be a useful tool to reinforce the Committee’s com-
mitment to its symmetric 2 percent objective.  

Participants also discussed the benefits and costs of us-
ing different types of balance sheet policy.  Participants

generally agreed that the balance sheet policies imple-
mented by the Federal Reserve after the crisis had eased 
financial conditions and had contributed to the eco-
nomic recovery, and that those tools had become an im-
portant part of the Committee’s current toolkit.  How-
ever, some participants pointed out that research had 
produced a sizable range of estimates of the magnitude 
of the economic effects of balance sheet actions.  In ad-
dition, some participants noted that the effectiveness of 
these tools might be diminished in the future, as longer-
term interest rates have declined to very low levels and 
would likely be even lower following an adverse shock 
that could lead to the resumption of large-scale asset 
purchases; as a result, there might be limited scope for 
balance sheet tools to provide accommodation.  Several 
participants commented on the advantages and disad-
vantages of flow-based asset purchase programs tied to 
the achievement of economic outcomes.  On the one 
hand, such programs adjusted automatically in response 
to the performance of the economy and, hence, were 
more straightforward to implement and communicate.  
On the other hand, flow-based asset purchase programs 
may result in the balance sheet rising to undesirable lev-
els.  A few participants also commented that, barring sig-
nificant dislocations to particular segments of the mar-
kets, they would restrict asset purchases to Treasury se-
curities to avoid perceptions that the Federal Reserve 
was engaging in credit allocation across sectors of the 
economy. 

In considering policy tools that the Federal Reserve had 
not used in the recent past, participants discussed the 
benefits and costs of using balance sheet tools to cap 
rates on short- or long-maturity Treasury securities 
through open market operations as necessary.  A few 
participants saw benefits to capping longer-term interest 
rates that more directly influence household and busi-
ness spending.  In addition, capping longer-maturity in-
terest rates using balance sheet tools, if judged as credi-
ble by market participants, might require a smaller 
amount of asset purchases to provide a similar amount 
of accommodation as a quantity-based program pur-
chasing longer-maturity securities.  However, many par-
ticipants raised concerns about capping long-term rates.  
Some of those participants noted that uncertainty re-
garding the neutral federal funds rate and regarding the 
effects of rate ceiling policies on future interest rates and 
inflation made it difficult to determine the appropriate 
level of the rate ceiling or when that ceiling should be 
removed; that maintaining a rate ceiling could result in 
an elevated level of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 

or significant volatility in its size or maturity composi-
tion; or that managing longer-term interest rates might 
be seen as interacting with the federal debt management 
process.  By contrast, a majority of participants saw 
greater benefits in using balance sheet tools to cap 
shorter-term interest rates and reinforce forward guid-
ance about the near-term path of the policy rate.  

All participants judged that negative interest rates cur-
rently did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy 
tool in the United States.  Participants commented that 
there was limited scope to bring the policy rate into neg-
ative territory, that the evidence on the beneficial effects 
of negative interest rates abroad was mixed, and that it 
was unclear what effects negative rates might have on 
the willingness of financial intermediaries to lend and on 
the spending plans of households and businesses.  Par-
ticipants noted that negative interest rates would entail 
risks of introducing significant complexity or distortions 
to the financial system.  In particular, some participants 
cautioned that the financial system in the United States 
is considerably different from those in countries that im-
plemented negative interest rate policies, and that nega-
tive rates could have more significant adverse effects on 
market functioning and financial stability here than 
abroad.  Notwithstanding these considerations, partici-
pants did not rule out the possibility that circumstances 
could arise in which it might be appropriate to reassess 
the potential role of negative interest rates as a policy 
tool. 

Overall, participants generally agreed that the forward 
guidance and balance sheet policies followed by the Fed-
eral Reserve after the financial crisis had been effective 
in providing stimulus at the ELB.  With estimates of 
equilibrium real interest rates having declined notably 
over recent decades, policymakers saw less room to re-
duce the federal funds rate to support the economy in 
the event of a downturn.  In addition, against a back-
ground of inflation undershooting the symmetric 2 per-
cent objective for several years, some participants raised 
the concern that the scope to reduce the federal funds 
rate to provide support to economic activity in future 
recessions could be reduced further if inflation shortfalls 
continued and led to a decline in inflation expectations.  
Therefore, participants generally agreed it was important 
for the Committee to keep a wide range of tools available 
and employ them as appropriate to support the econ-
omy.  Doing so would help ensure the anchoring of in-
flation expectations at a level consistent with the Com-
mittee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.

Some participants noted that the form of the policy re-
sponse would depend critically on the circumstances the 
Committee faced at the time.  Several participants sug-
gested that communicating to the public clearly and con-
vincingly in advance about how the Committee intended 
to provide accommodation at the ELB would enhance 
public confidence and support the effectiveness of 
whichever tool the Committee selected.  Some partici-
pants thought it would be helpful for the Committee to 
evaluate how its tools could be utilized in different eco-
nomic scenarios, such as when longer-term interest rates 
were significantly below current levels, and discuss 
which actions would best address the challenges posed 
by each scenario.  Several participants noted that, partic-
ularly if monetary policy became severely constrained at 
the ELB, expansionary fiscal policy would be especially 
important in addressing an economic downturn.  

Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they 
would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s 
review of the monetary policy framework as well as the 
Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Mon-
etary Policy Strategy.  They also generally agreed that the 
Committee’s consideration of possible modifications to 
its policy strategy, tools, and communication practices 
would take some time and that the process would be 
careful, deliberate, and patient.  A number of partici-
pants judged that the review could be completed around 
the middle of 2020. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager pro tem first reviewed developments in fi-
nancial markets over the intermeeting period.  Early in 
the period, market participants focused on signs of 
weakness in U.S. economic data with some soft data 
from business surveys viewed as substantiating concerns 
that global headwinds were spilling over to the U.S. 
economy.  Later in the period, markets responded to 
news suggesting favorable developments around Brexit 
and a partial U.S.-China trade deal.  On balance, U.S. fi-
nancial conditions ended the period little changed.   

Regarding the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, the 
Open Market Desk’s surveys and market-based indica-
tors pointed to a high likelihood of a 25 basis point cut 
in the target range at the October meeting.  The proba-
bility that survey respondents placed on this outcome 
was broadly similar to the probability of a 25 basis point 
cut ahead of the July and September meetings.  Further 
ahead, the path implied by the medians of survey re-
spondents’ modal forecasts for the federal funds rate re-
mained essentially flat after this meeting.  Meanwhile, the 

market-implied path suggested that investors expected 
around 25 basis points of additional easing by the end of 
2020, after the anticipated easing at this meeting.  

The manager pro tem next turned to a review of money 
market developments since early October.  On Octo-
ber 11, the Committee announced its decision to main-
tain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early 
September through a program of Treasury bill purchases 
and repurchase agreement (repo) operations.  After the 
announcement, the Desk conducted regular operations 
that offered at least $75 billion in overnight repo funding 
and between $135 and $170 billion in term funding.  
These operations fostered conditions that helped main-
tain the federal funds rate within the target range 
through two channels.  First, they provided funding in 
repo markets that dampened repo market pressure that 
would otherwise have passed through to the federal 
funds market, and second, they increased the supply of 
reserves in the banking system.  In anticipation of an-
other projected sharp decline in reserves and expected 
rate pressures around October 31, the Desk announced 
an increase in the size of overnight repos to $120 billion, 
and an increase in the size of the two term repo opera-
tions that crossed the October month-end to $45 billion.   

With respect to purchases of Treasury bills for reserve 
management purposes, the Desk had purchased more 
than half of the initial $60 billion monthly amount for 
October, and propositions at the five operations con-
ducted to date had been strong.  Respondents to the 
Desk surveys expected reserve management purchases 
of Treasury bills to continue at the same pace for some 
time.  The combination of repo operations and bill pur-
chases lifted reserve levels above those observed in early 
September.   

The manager pro tem noted that diminished willingness 
of some dealers to intermediate across money markets 
ahead of the year-end could result in upward pressure on 
short-term money market rates.  Forward measures of 
market pricing continued to indicate expectations for 
such pressures around the year-end.  The Desk planned 
to continue its close monitoring of reserves and money 
market conditions, as well as dealer participation in repo 
operations, particularly given balance sheet constraints 
heading into year-end.  The Desk discussed its intentions 
to further adjust operations around year-end as needed 
to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could 
adversely affect policy implementation, and to maintain 
over time a level of reserve balances at or above those 
that prevailed in early September.

The manager pro tem finished by noting that the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York would soon release a request 
for public comment on a plan to publish a series of back-
ward looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) 
averages and a daily SOFR index to support the transi-
tion away from instruments based on LIBOR (London 
interbank offered rate).  Publication of these series was 
expected to begin in the first half of 2020. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Review of Options for Repo Operations to Support 
Control of the Federal Funds Rate 
The staff briefed participants on the recent experience 
with using repo operations to support control of the fed-
eral funds rate and on possibly maintaining a role for 
repo operations in the monetary policy implementation 
framework over the longer run.  Ongoing capacity for 
repo operations could be viewed as useful in an ample-
reserves regime as a way of providing insurance against 
unexpected stresses in money markets that could drive 
the federal funds rate outside the Committee’s target 
range over a sustained period.  The staff presented two 
potential approaches for conducting repo operations if 
the Committee decided to maintain an ongoing role for 
such operations.  Under the first approach, the Desk 
would conduct modestly sized, relatively frequent repo 
operations designed to provide a high degree of readi-
ness should the need for larger operations arise; under 
the second approach, the FOMC would establish a 
standing fixed-rate facility that could serve as an auto-
matic money market stabilizer.8  Assessing these two ap-
proaches involved several considerations, including the 
degree of assurance of control over the federal funds 
rate, the likelihood that participation in the Federal Re-
serve’s repo operations could become stigmatized, the 
possibility that the operations could encourage the Fed-
eral Reserve’s counterparties to take on excessive liquid-
ity risks in their portfolios, and the potential disinterme-
diation of financial transactions currently undertaken by 
private counterparties.  Regular, modestly sized repo op-
erations likely would pose relatively little risk of stigma 
or moral hazard, but they may provide less assurance of 
control over the federal funds rate because it might be 
difficult for the Federal Reserve to anticipate money

role of a standing repo facility in the monetary policy imple-
mentation framework. 

market pressures and scale up its repo operations ac-
cordingly.  A standing fixed-rate repo facility would 
likely provide substantial assurance of control over the 
federal funds rate, but use of the facility could become 
stigmatized, particularly if the rate was set at a relatively 
high level.  Conversely, a standing facility with a rate set 
at a relatively low level could result in larger and more 
frequent repo operations than would be appropriate.  
And by effectively standing ready to provide a form of 
liquidity on an as-needed basis, such a facility could in-
crease the risk that some institutions may take on an un-
desirably high amount of liquidity risk.   

In their comments following the staff presentation, par-
ticipants emphasized the importance of maintaining re-
serves at a level consistent with the Committee’s choice 
of an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation 
framework, in which control over the level of the federal 
funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of 
the Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which 
active management of the supply of reserves is not re-
quired.  Some participants indicated that, in such an en-
vironment, they would have some tolerance for allowing 
the federal funds rate to vary from day to day and to 
move occasionally outside its target range, especially in 
those instances associated with easily identifiable tech-
nical events; a couple of participants expressed discom-
fort with such misses.   

Participants expressed a range of views on the relative 
merits of the two approaches described by the staff for 
conducting repo operations.  Many participants noted 
that, once an ample supply of reserves is firmly estab-
lished, there might be little need for a standing repo fa-
cility or for frequent repo operations.  Some of these 
participants indicated that a basic principle in imple-
menting an ample-reserves framework is to maintain re-
serves on an ongoing basis at levels that would obviate 
the need for open market operations to address pres-
sures in funding markets in all but exceptional circum-
stances.  Many participants remarked, however, that 
even in an environment with ample reserves, a standing 
facility could serve as a useful backstop to support con-
trol of the federal funds rate in the event of outsized 
shocks to the system.  Several of these participants also 
suggested that, if a standing facility were created that al-
lowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities 
holdings at times of market stress, banks could possibly 
reduce their demand for reserves in normal times, which

could make it feasible for the monetary policy imple-
mentation framework to operate with a significantly 
smaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be 
needed.  A couple of participants pointed out that estab-
lishing a standing facility would be similar to the practice 
of some other major central banks.  A number of partic-
ipants noted that, before deciding whether to implement 
a standing repo facility, additional work would be neces-
sary to assess the likely implications of different design 
choices for a standing repo facility, such as pricing, eligi-
ble counterparties, and the set of acceptable collateral.  
Echoing issues raised at the Committee’s June 2019 
meeting, various participants commented on the need to 
carefully evaluate these design choices to guard against 
the potential for moral hazard, stigma, disintermediation 
risk, or excessive volatility in the Federal Reserve’s bal-
ance sheet.  A couple of other participants suggested that 
an approach based on modestly sized, frequent repo op-
erations that could be quickly and substantially ramped 
up in response to emerging market pressures would mit-
igate the moral hazard, disintermediation, and stigmati-
zation risks associated with a standing repo facility. 

Participants made no decisions at this meeting on the 
longer-run role of repo operations in the ample-reserves 
regime or on an approach for conducting repo opera-
tions over the longer run.  They generally agreed that 
they should continue to monitor the market effects of 
the Federal Reserve’s ongoing repo operations and 
Treasury bill purchases and that additional analysis of the 
recent period of money market dislocations or of fluctu-
ations in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities was 
warranted.  Some participants called for further research 
on the role that the financial regulatory environment or 
other factors may have played in the recent dislocations.   

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the October 29–30 meet-
ing indicated that labor market conditions remained 
strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) in-
creased at a moderate rate in the third quarter.  Con-
sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per-
centage change in the price index for personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in 
August.  Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation 
expectations were little changed. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower 
pace in September than in the previous two months, but 
the average pace for the third quarter was similar to that 
for the first half of the year.  However, the pace of job 
gains so far this year was slower than last year, even after 
accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of 

Labor Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employ-
ment, which will be incorporated in the published data 
in February 2020.  The unemployment rate moved down 
to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in September, while the 
labor force participation rate held steady and the em-
ployment-to-population ratio moved up.  The unem-
ployment rates for Asians, Hispanics, and whites each 
moved lower in September, but the rate for African 
Americans was unchanged; the unemployment rate for 
each group was below its level at the end of the previous 
economic expansion, though persistent differentials be-
tween these rates remained.  The average share of work-
ers employed part time for economic reasons in Septem-
ber continued to be below its level in late 2007.  The rate 
of private-sector job openings declined in August, and 
the rate of quits also edged down, but both readings were 
still at relatively elevated levels.  The four-week moving 
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits through mid-October remained near historically 
low levels.  Average hourly earnings for all employees 
rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem-
ber, roughly similar to the pace a year earlier. 

Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price 
index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending 
in August.  Core PCE price inflation (which excludes 
changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 
1.8 percent over that same 12-month period, while con-
sumer food price inflation was well below core inflation, 
and consumer energy prices declined.  The trimmed 
mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con-
structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained 
at 2 percent in August.  The consumer price index (CPI) 
rose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem-
ber, while core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent.  Recent 
readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla-
tion expectations—including those from the University 
of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Blue Chip Eco-
nomic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little 
changed, on balance, although the Michigan survey 
measure ticked down to the low end of its recent range. 

Real PCE rose solidly in the third quarter following a 
stronger gain in the second quarter.  Overall consumer 
spending rose steadily in recent months, and sales of 
light motor vehicles through September maintained their 
robust second-quarter pace.  Key factors that influence 
consumer spending—including the low unemployment 
rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels 
of households’ net worth, and generally low borrowing 
rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the 
near term.  The Michigan survey measure of consumer

sentiment rose again in October and had mostly recov-
ered from its August slump, while the Conference Board 
survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a 
favorable level. 

Real residential investment turned up solidly in the third 
quarter following six consecutive quarters of contrac-
tion.  This upturn was consistent with the rise in single-
family starts in the third quarter, and building permits 
for such units—which tend to be a good indicator for 
the underlying trend in the construction of such 
homes—also increased.  Both new and existing home 
sales increased, on net, in August and September.  Taken 
together, the data on construction and sales suggested 
that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 was 
starting to show through to housing activity. 

Real nonresidential private fixed investment declined 
further in the third quarter.  Nominal shipments of non-
defense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased over 
August and September, and forward-looking indicators 
generally pointed to continued softness in business 
equipment spending.  Orders for nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft decreased over those two 
months and were still below the level of shipments, most 
measures of business sentiment deteriorated, analysts’ 
expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth de-
clined somewhat further, and concerns about trade de-
velopments continued to weigh on firms’ investment de-
cisions.  Business expenditures for nonresidential struc-
tures decreased markedly further in the third quarter, 
and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in op-
eration—an indicator of business spending for struc-
tures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to de-
cline through mid-October. 

Industrial production declined in September and was 
notably lower than at the beginning of the year.  Produc-
tion in September was held down by the strike at Gen-
eral Motors, and automakers’ schedules indicated that 
assemblies of light motor vehicles would remain low in 
October before rebounding in November.  Overall man-
ufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in 
coming months, reflecting generally weak readings on 
new orders from national and regional manufacturing 
surveys, declining domestic business investment, weak 
GDP growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade 
developments. 

Total real government purchases rose at a slower pace in 
the third quarter than in the second quarter.  Real federal 
purchases decelerated, reflecting smaller increases in 
both defense and nondefense spending.  Federal hiring 
of temporary workers for next year’s decennial census 

was quite modest during the quarter.  Real purchases by 
state and local governments also rose at a slower pace, 
as the boost from a faster expansion in state and local 
payrolls was partially offset by a decrease in real con-
struction spending by these governments. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in 
August, reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and 
a moderate pace of import growth.  Export growth was 
subdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital 
goods.  Advance estimates for September suggested that 
goods imports fell more than exports, pointing to a nar-
rowing of the monthly trade deficit.  The Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis estimated that net exports made a slight 
negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third 
quarter.  

Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign 
economies remained subpar in the third quarter.  In sev-
eral advanced foreign economies (AFEs), indicators 
showed continued weakness in the manufacturing sec-
tor, especially in the euro area and the United Kingdom.  
Similarly, GDP growth remained subdued in China and 
several other emerging economies in Asia, and indicators 
suggested that growth in Latin America also remained 
weak.  Foreign inflation appeared to have moderated a 
bit in the third quarter, reflecting declines in energy 
prices.  Inflation remained relatively low in most foreign 
economies. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investor sentiment weakened over the early part of the 
intermeeting period, reflecting a few weaker-than-ex-
pected domestic data releases, but later strengthened on 
increased optimism regarding ongoing trade negotia-
tions between the United States and China and positive 
Brexit news.  On net, equity prices and corporate bond 
spreads were little changed, and the Treasury yield curve 
steepened a bit.  Financing conditions for businesses and 
households remained generally supportive of spending 
and economic activity. 

September FOMC communications were viewed as 
slightly less accommodative than expected, with inves-
tors reportedly surprised by the Summary of Economic 
Projections showing that a majority of FOMC partici-
pants anticipated no further easing this year.  Incoming 
data early in the intermeeting period—particularly the 
disappointing readings on business activity—prompted 
a decline in the market-implied path for the policy rate, 
but that decline was later partly reversed as market par-
ticipants apparently grew more optimistic on the pro-
spects for a U.S.–China trade deal and Brexit negotia-
tions.  Late in the period, quotes on federal funds futures 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

options contracts indicated that market participants as-
signed a very high probability to a 25 basis point reduc-
tion in the target range of the federal funds rate at the 
October FOMC meeting.  In addition, market-implied 
expectations for the federal funds rate at year-end and 
next year moved down. 

Yields on nominal U.S. Treasury securities moved down 
in the early part of the intermeeting period but later re-
traced their declines.  On net, the Treasury yield curve 
steepened a bit, mostly reflecting a modest decline in 
short-term yields.  Measures of inflation compensation 
over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities inched down and 
remained near multiyear low levels. 

Broad stock price indexes fell by as much as 4 percent 
during the first half of the intermeeting period but re-
covered afterward, ending the period roughly un-
changed.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in-
dex declined slightly and ended the period below the 
middle of its historical distribution.  On net, corporate 
credit spreads were little changed. 

Domestic short-term funding markets were volatile in 
mid-September and exhibited additional, albeit modest, 
pressures around the September quarter-end and the 
mid-October Treasury settlement date.  These pressures 
were alleviated in part by the Desk’s overnight and term 
repo operations that began on September 17.  After 
smoothing through rate volatility over the period, inter-
est rates for overnight unsecured and secured funding 
declined roughly in line with the reduction in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the September FOMC 
meeting and the associated 30 basis point decrease in the 
interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate.  The effective 
federal funds rate (EFFR) was more volatile than usual 
over the intermeeting period, with the EFFR–IOER 
spread ranging between 2 basis points and 10 basis 
points.  Rates on overnight commercial paper (CP) and 
short-term negotiable certificates of deposit declined 
fairly quickly following the announcement of Desk op-
erations on September 17, although some CP rates re-
mained elevated into October.  The FOMC’s Octo-
ber 11 announcement of Treasury bill purchases and 
repo operations to maintain reserves at or above their 
early-September level appeared to improve expectations 
about funding market conditions through the remainder 
of the year.  These communications reportedly did not 
materially affect yields on longer-term Treasury securi-
ties. 

Financial markets in the AFEs followed a pattern similar 
to that seen in the United States.  AFE financial condi-
tions tightened early in the intermeeting period on dis-
appointing activity data, both in the United States and 
abroad, and subsequently recovered on perceived better 
prospects for trade and Brexit negotiations.  Movements 
in the exchange value of the dollar against most curren-
cies were relatively modest, and the broad dollar index 
declined slightly.  Relative to the dollar, the British 
pound appreciated on Brexit developments, and the Ar-
gentinian peso continued to depreciate amid the coun-
try’s political developments. 

The mid-September increases in U.S. Treasury repo rates 
spilled over to borrowing rates in the international dollar 
funding market.  However, the measures taken by the 
Federal Reserve to keep the federal funds rate in the tar-
get range also calmed dollar funding conditions in the 
foreign exchange swap market. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re-
mained generally accommodative during the intermeet-
ing period.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds, which 
was strong in September, experienced a typical seasonal 
decline in October.  Gross issuance of institutional lev-
eraged loans remained solid but slightly below 2019 
monthly averages.  Meanwhile, growth of commercial 
and industrial (C&I) loans at banks was modest in the 
third quarter as a whole.  Respondents to the October 
2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that borrower de-
mand weakened for C&I loans over the third quarter, 
while lending standards on such loans were about un-
changed.  Gross equity issuance through both initial and 
seasoned offerings picked up to a strong pace in Septem-
ber but moderated in October.  The credit quality of 
nonfinancial corporations deteriorated slightly in recent 
months but remained solid on balance.  Credit condi-
tions for both small businesses and municipalities stayed 
accommodative on net. 

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions also remained generally accommodative.  The 
volume of agency and non-agency commercial mort-
gage-backed securities issuance was strong in Septem-
ber, in part supported by recent declines in interest rates.  
Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books was little 
changed in the third quarter.  Banks in the October 
SLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all types 
of CRE loans; they also reported weaker demand for 
construction lending and stronger demand for the other 
CRE lending categories.

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
remained accommodative on balance.  Mortgage rates 
were little changed since the September FOMC meeting 
and stayed near their lowest level since mid-2016.  In 
September, home-purchase originations remained 
around the relatively high level seen during the previous 
two months, while refinancing originations jumped to 
their highest level since late 2012.  In the October 
SLOOS, banks left their lending standards basically un-
changed for most residential real estate loan categories 
over the third quarter.  However, for subprime loans, a 
moderate net percentage of banks reported tightening 
standards. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally supportive of household spending, al-
though conditions continued to be tight for credit card 
borrowers with nonprime credit scores.  Interest rates 
on auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, 
and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off 
through August.  According to the October SLOOS, 
commercial banks tightened their standards on credit 
cards and other consumer loans over the third quarter.  
Additionally, banks reported that their standards on auto 
loans and their willingness to make consumer install-
ment loans were about unchanged on balance. 

The staff provided an update on its assessments of po-
tential risks to financial stability.  On balance, the staff 
characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. fi-
nancial system as moderate.  The staff judged that, for 
many asset classes, valuation pressures eased over the 
past year.  Appetite for risk in the leveraged loan market 
remained elevated, but less so than last year, especially 
for lower-rated loans.  In addition, CRE prices remained 
high relative to rental income.  In assessing vulnerabili-
ties stemming from borrowing in the household and 
business sectors, the staff noted that, while household 
borrowing continued to decline relative to nominal 
GDP, business leverage remained at or near record-high 
levels.  The risks associated with leverage at financial in-
stitutions were viewed as being low, as they have been 
for some time, largely because of high capital ratios at 
large banks.  Nonetheless, the staff noted that the resili-
ence of financial institutions could be undermined by 
low interest rates and banks’ announced plans to in-
crease payouts to shareholders.  The staff assessed vul-
nerabilities stemming from funding risk as modest.  In 
addition, the staff discussed the potential for liquidity 
transformation by open-ended mutual funds investing in 
bank loans to lead to market dislocations under stress 
scenarios, while noting that outflows from such funds 
have not often been associated with such dislocations. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by 
the staff for the October FOMC meeting was revised 
down a little for the second half of this year relative to 
the previous projection.  This revision reflected the esti-
mated effects of the strike at General Motors along with 
some other small factors.  Even without this downward 
revision, real GDP was forecast to rise more slowly in 
the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly 
because of continued soft business investment and 
slower increases in government spending.  The medium-
term projection for real GDP growth was essentially un-
changed, as revisions to the staff’s assumptions about 
factors on which the forecast was conditioned, such as 
financial market variables, were small and offsetting.  
Real GDP was expected to decelerate modestly over the 
medium term, mostly because of a waning boost from 
fiscal policy.  Output was forecast to expand at a rate a 
little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of 
growth in 2019 and 2020 and then to slow to a pace 
slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.  
The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat 
through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of 
its longer-run natural rate.   

The staff’s forecast for core PCE price inflation this year 
was revised down a little in response to recent data.  Be-
yond this year, the projection for core inflation was un-
revised, and the forecast for total inflation was a little 
lower in 2020 because of a downward revision in pro-
jected consumer energy prices.  Both total inflation and 
core inflation were forecast to move up slightly next 
year, as the low inflation readings early this year were 
viewed as transitory; nevertheless, both inflation 
measures were forecast to continue to run somewhat be-
low 2 percent through 2022. 

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of 
the past 20 years.  Moreover, the staff still judged that 
the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted 
to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up-
side for the unemployment rate.  Important factors in 
that assessment were that international trade tensions 
and foreign economic developments seemed more likely 
to move in directions that could have significant nega-
tive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more 
favorably than assumed.  In addition, softness in busi-
ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was 
seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial 
slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  
The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as

having a downward skew, in part because of the down-
side risks to the forecast for economic activity. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
Participants agreed that the labor market had remained 
strong over the intermeeting period and that economic 
activity had risen at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been 
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had remained low.  Although household 
spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in-
vestment and exports had remained weak.  On a 
12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items 
other than food and energy were running below 2 per-
cent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation 
remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations were little changed. 

Participants generally viewed the economic outlook as 
positive.  Participants judged that sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective were the most likely outcomes, and they indicated 
that their views on these outcomes had changed little 
since the September meeting.  Uncertainties associated 
with trade tensions as well as geopolitical risks had eased 
somewhat, though they remained elevated.  In addition, 
inflation pressures remained muted.  The risk that a 
global growth slowdown would further weigh on the do-
mestic economy remained prominent.   

In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
agreed that consumer spending was increasing at a 
strong pace.  They also generally expected that, in the 
period ahead, household spending would likely remain 
on a firm footing, supported by strong labor market con-
ditions, rising incomes, and favorable financial condi-
tions.  In addition, survey measures of consumer confi-
dence remained high, and a couple of participants com-
mented that business contacts in consumer-facing indus-
tries reported strong demand.  Many participants noted 
that components of household spending that are 
thought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had 
improved, including purchases of consumer durables.  
In addition, residential investment had turned up.  Most 
participants who reported on spending by households in 
their Districts also cited favorable conditions for con-
sumer spending, although several participants reported 
mixed data on spending or an increase in precautionary 
savings in their Districts.   

In their discussions of the business sector, participants 
saw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth 

outlook as the main factors contributing to weak busi-
ness investment and exports and the associated restraint 
on domestic economic growth.  Moreover, participants 
generally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish 
global growth would continue to damp investment 
spending and exports.  A number of participants judged 
that tight labor market conditions were also causing 
firms to forego investment expenditures, or invest in au-
tomation systems to reduce the need for additional hir-
ing.  However, business sentiment appeared to remain 
strong for some industries, particularly those most 
closely connected with consumer goods.  

Participants discussed developments in the manufactur-
ing, energy, and agricultural sectors of the U.S. economy.  
Manufacturing production remained weak, and continu-
ing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty 
suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve ma-
terially over the near term.  In addition, the labor strike 
at General Motors had disrupted motor vehicle output, 
and ongoing issues at Boeing were slowing manufactur-
ing in the commercial aircraft industry.  A couple of par-
ticipants noted that activity was particularly weak for the 
energy industry, in part because of low petroleum prices.  
In addition, a few  participants noted ongoing challenges 
in the agricultural sector, including those associated with 
lower crop yields, tariffs, weak export demand, and dif-
ficult financial positions for many farmers.  One bright 
spot for the agricultural sector was that some commod-
ity prices had firmed recently.  

Participants judged that conditions in the labor market 
remained strong, with the unemployment rate near his-
torical lows and continued solid job gains, on average.  
In addition, some participants commented on the 
strength or improvement in labor force participation na-
tionally or in their Districts.  However, the pace of in-
creases in employment had slowed some, on net, in re-
cent months.  On the one hand, the slowing could be 
interpreted as a natural consequence of the economy be-
ing near full employment.  On the other hand, slowing 
job gains might also be indicative of some cooling in la-
bor demand, which may be consistent with an observed 
decline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other 
measures of labor market tightness.  Several participants 
commented that the preliminary benchmark revision re-
leased in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had 
indicated that payroll employment gains would likely 
show less momentum coming into this year once those 
revisions are incorporated in published data early next 
year.  Growth of wages had also slowed this year by 
some measures.  Consistent with strong national data on

the labor market, business contacts in many Districts in-
dicated continued strong labor demand, with firms still 
reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, or broad-
ening their recruiting to include traditionally marginal-
ized groups. 

In their discussion of inflation developments, partici-
pants noted that readings on overall and core PCE infla-
tion, measured on a 12-month change basis, had contin-
ued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent 
objective.  While survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations were generally little changed, some 
measures of households’ inflation expectations had 
moved down to historically low levels.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low, with 
some longer-term measures being at or near multi-year 
lows.  Weakness in the global economy, perceptions of 
downside risks to growth, and subdued global inflation 
pressures were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the 
downside, and a few participants commented that they 
expected inflation to run below 2 percent for some time.  
Some other participants, however, saw the recent infla-
tion data as consistent with their previous assessment 
that much of the weakness seen early in the year would 
be transitory, or that some recent monthly readings 
seemed broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-
run inflation objective of 2 percent.  A couple of partic-
ipants noted that some measures of inflation could tem-
porarily move above 2 percent early next year because of 
the transitory effects of tariffs.  

Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook 
for economic activity, which remained tilted to the 
downside.  Some risks were seen to have eased a bit, al-
though they remained elevated.  There were some tenta-
tive signs that trade tensions were easing, the probability 
of a no-deal Brexit was judged to have lessened, and 
some other geopolitical tensions had diminished.  Sev-
eral participants noted that statistical models designed to 
gauge the probability of recession, including those based 
on information from the yield curve, suggested that the 
likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium 
term had fallen somewhat over the intermeeting period.  
However, other downside risks had not diminished.  In 
particular, some further signs of a global slowdown in 
economic growth emerged; weakening in the global 
economy could further restrain the domestic economy, 
and the risk that the weakness in domestic business 
spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to 
slower hiring and weigh on household spending re-
mained prominent.   

Among those participants who commented on financial 
stability, most highlighted the risks associated with high 
levels of corporate indebtedness and elevated valuation 
pressures for a variety of risky assets.  Although financial 
stability risks overall were seen as moderate, several par-
ticipants indicated that imbalances in the corporate debt 
market had grown over the economic expansion and 
raised the concern that deteriorating credit quality could 
lead to sharp increases in risk spreads in corporate bond 
markets; these developments could amplify the effects 
of an adverse shock to the economy.  Several partici-
pants were concerned that some banks had reduced the 
sizes of their capital buffers at a time when they should 
be rising.  A few participants observed that valuations in 
equity and bond markets were high by historical stand-
ards and that CRE valuations were also elevated.  A cou-
ple of participants indicated that market participants may 
be overly optimistic in the pricing of risk for corporate 
debt.  A couple of participants judged that the monitor-
ing of financial stability vulnerabilities should also en-
compass risks related to climate change.   

In their consideration of the monetary policy options at 
this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction 
of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds 
rate would be appropriate.  In discussing the reasons for 
such a decision, these participants continued to point to 
global developments weighing on the economic outlook, 
the need to provide insurance against potential downside 
risks to the economic outlook, and the importance of 
returning inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 per-
cent objective on a sustained basis.  A couple of partici-
pants who were supportive of a rate cut at this meeting 
indicated that the decision to reduce the federal funds 
rate by 25 basis points was a close call relative to the op-
tion of leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this 
meeting.   

Many participants judged that an additional modest eas-
ing at this meeting was appropriate in light of persistent 
weakness in global growth and elevated uncertainty re-
garding trade developments.  Nonetheless, these partic-
ipants noted that incoming data had continued to sug-
gest that the economy had proven resilient in the face of 
continued headwinds from global developments and 
that previous adjustments to monetary policy would 
continue to help sustain economic growth.  In addition, 
several participants suggested that a modest easing of 
policy at this meeting would likely better align the target 
range for the federal funds rate with a variety of indica-
tors used to assess the appropriate policy stance, includ-
ing estimates of the neutral interest rate and the slope of 
the yield curve.  A couple of participants judged that 

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

there was more room for the labor market to improve.  
Accordingly, they saw further accommodation as best 
supporting both of the Committee’s dual-mandate ob-
jectives.  

Many participants continued to view the downside risks 
surrounding the economic outlook as elevated, further 
underscoring the case for a rate cut at this meeting.  In 
particular, risks to the outlook associated with global 
economic growth and international trade were still seen 
as significant despite some encouraging geopolitical and 
trade-related developments over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  In light of these risks, a number of participants 
were concerned that weakness in business spending, 
manufacturing, and exports could spill over to labor 
markets and consumer spending and threaten the eco-
nomic expansion.  A few participants observed that the 
considerations favoring easing at this meeting were rein-
forced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the 
ELB.  In their view, providing adequate accommodation 
while still away from the ELB would best mitigate the 
possibility of a costly return to the ELB.   

Many participants also cited the level of inflation or in-
flation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis 
points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Inflation 
continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective, and inflationary pressures remained 
muted.  Several participants raised concerns that 
measures of inflation expectations remained low and 
could decline further without a more accommodative 
policy stance.  A couple of these participants, pointing 
to experiences in Japan and the euro area, were con-
cerned that persistent inflation shortfalls could lead to a 
decline in longer-run inflation expectations and less 
room to reduce the federal funds rate in the event of a 
future recession.  In general, the participants who justi-
fied further easing at this meeting based on considera-
tions related to inflation viewed this action as helping to 
move inflation up to the Committee’s 2 percent objec-
tive on a sustained basis and to anchor inflation expec-
tations at levels consistent with that objective.  

Some participants favored maintaining the existing tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  
These participants suggested that the baseline projection 
for the economy remained favorable, with inflation ex-
pected to move up and stay near the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective.  They also judged that policy accommo-
dation was already adequate and, in light of lags in the 
transmission of monetary policy, preferred to take some 
time to assess the economic effects of the Committee’s 
previous policy actions before easing policy further.  

Several participants noted that downside risks had di-
minished over the intermeeting period and saw little in-
dication that weakness in business sentiment was spilling 
over into labor markets and consumer spending.  A few 
participants raised the concern that a further easing of 
monetary policy at this meeting could encourage exces-
sive risk-taking and exacerbate imbalances in the finan-
cial sector. 

With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, 
most participants judged that the stance of policy, after 
a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, would be well 
calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a 
strong labor market, and inflation near the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective and likely would remain 
so as long as incoming information about the economy 
did not result in a material reassessment of the economic 
outlook.  However, participants noted that policy was 
not on a preset course and that they would be monitor-
ing the effects of the Committee’s recent policy actions, 
as well as other information bearing on the economic 
outlook, in assessing the appropriate path of the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  A couple of participants 
expressed the view that the Committee should reinforce 
its postmeeting statement with additional communica-
tions indicating that another reduction in the federal 
funds rate was unlikely in the near term unless incoming 
information was consistent with a significant slowdown 
in the pace of economic activity.   

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members noted that information received since the Sep-
tember meeting indicated that the labor market re-
mained strong and that economic activity had been ris-
ing at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been solid, on av-
erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had 
remained low.  Household spending had been rising at a 
strong pace.  However, business fixed investment and 
exports remained weak, as softness in global growth and 
international trade developments continued to weigh on 
those sectors.  On a 12-month basis, both the overall 
inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and 
energy were running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low.  Sur-
vey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed.   

In light of the implications of global developments for 
the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pres-
sures, most members agreed to lower the target range 
for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent at this 
meeting.  The members who supported this action

viewed it as consistent with helping offset the effects on 
aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade de-
velopments, insuring against downside risks arising from 
those sources, and promoting a more rapid return of in-
flation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive.  Two members preferred to maintain the current 
target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  
These members indicated that the economic outlook re-
mained positive and that they anticipated, under an un-
changed policy stance, continued strong labor market 
conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation 
gradually moving up to the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective.   

Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its maximum-
employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objective.  They also agreed that those assessments 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to update the language of the Committee’s de-
scription of incoming data to acknowledge that invest-
ment spending and U.S. exports had remained weak.  In 
describing the monetary policy outlook, they also agreed 
to remove the “act as appropriate” language and empha-
size that the Committee would continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming information for the economic 
outlook as it assessed the appropriate path of the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  This change was seen 
as consistent with the view that the current stance of 
monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate as long 
as the economy performed broadly in line with the Com-
mittee’s expectations and that policy was not on a preset 
course and could change if developments emerged that 
led to a material reassessment of the economic outlook. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective October 31, 2019, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 

of 1½ to 1¾ percent.  In light of recent and ex-
pected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-
reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the 
Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the 
second quarter of next year to maintain over 
time ample reserve balances at or above the 
level that prevailed in early September 2019.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to con-
duct term and overnight repurchase agreement 
operations at least through January of next year 
to ensure that the supply of reserves remains 
ample even during periods of sharp increases in 
non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of 
money market pressures that could adversely af-
fect policy implementation.  In addition, the 
Committee directs the Desk to conduct over-
night reverse repurchase operations (and re-
verse repurchase operations with maturities of 
more than one day when necessary to accom-
modate weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, 
in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury 
securities and to continue reinvesting all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.  Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in Treasury securities to roughly match 
the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in September indicates 
that the labor market remains strong and that 
economic activity has been rising at a moderate 
rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate has 
remained low.  Although household spending 
has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed 
investment and exports remain weak.  On a 
12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation 
for items other than food and energy are run-
ning below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expec-
tations are little changed. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  In light of the implications 
of global developments for the economic out-
look as well as muted inflation pressures, the 
Committee decided to lower the target range for 
the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent.  
This action supports the Committee’s view that 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective are the most likely outcomes, but uncer-
tainties about this outlook remain.  The Com-
mittee will continue to monitor the implications 
of incoming information for the economic out-
look as it assesses the appropriate path of the 
target range for the federal funds rate. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James 
Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, and 
Randal K. Quarles. 

Voting against this action:  Esther L. George and Eric 
Rosengren. 

President George dissented at this meeting because she 
believed that an unchanged setting of monetary policy 
was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook 
for economic activity over the medium term.  Recogniz-
ing risks to the outlook from the effects of trade devel-
opments and weaker global activity, President George 
would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data 
point to a materially weaker outlook for the economy.  
President Rosengren dissented because he judged that 
monetary policy was already accommodative and that 
additional accommodation was not needed for an econ-
omy in which labor markets are very tight.  He judged 
that providing additional accommodation posed risks of 
further inflating the prices of risky assets and encourag-
ing households and firms to take on too much leverage. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the 
target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ per-
cent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to 
lower the interest rate paid on required and excess re-
serve balances to 1.55 percent and voted unanimously to 
approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary 
credit rate to 2.25 percent, effective October 31, 2019. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 10–
11, 2019.  The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on Octo-
ber 30, 2019. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on October 8, 2019, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on September 17–18, 2019. 

Videoconference meeting of October 4, 2019 
The Committee met by videoconference on October 4, 
2019, to review developments in money markets and to 
discuss steps the Committee could take to facilitate effi-
cient and effective implementation of monetary policy.  

The staff reviewed recent developments in money mar-
kets and the effect of the Desk’s continued offering of 
overnight and term repo operations.  Staff analysis and 
market commentary suggested that many factors con-
tributed to the funding stresses that emerged in mid-Sep-
tember.  In particular, financial institutions’ internal risk 
limits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the dis-
tribution of liquidity across the system at a time when 
reserves had dropped sharply and Treasury issuance was 
elevated.  Although money market conditions had since 
improved, market participants expressed uncertainty 
about how funding market conditions may evolve over 
coming months, especially around year-end.  Further

out, the April 2020 tax season, with associated reduc-
tions in reserves around that time, was viewed as another 
point at which money market pressures could emerge.  

The manager pro tem reviewed options that the Com-
mittee could consider to boost the level of reserves in 
the banking system and to address temporary money 
market pressures that could adversely affect monetary 
policy implementation.  These options included a pro-
gram of Treasury bill purchases coupled with overnight 
and term repo operations to maintain reserves at or 
above their early September level.   

During their discussion, all FOMC participants agreed 
that control over the federal funds rate was a priority and 
that recent money market developments suggested it 
was appropriate to consider steps at this time to maintain 
a level of reserves consistent with the Committee’s cho-
sen ample-reserves regime.  Given the projected decline 
in reserves around year-end and in the spring of 2020, 
they judged that it was important to reach consensus 
soon on a near-term plan and associated communica-
tions.   

All participants expressed support for a plan to purchase 
Treasury bills into the second quarter of 2020 and to 
continue conducting overnight and term repo opera-
tions at least through January of next year.  Many partic-
ipants supported conducting operations to maintain re-
serve balances around the level that prevailed in early 
September.  Some others suggested moving to an even 
higher level of reserves to provide an extra buffer and 
greater assurance of control over the federal funds rate.  
In discussing the pace of Treasury bill purchases, many 
participants supported a relatively rapid pace to boost 
reserve levels quickly, while others supported a more 
moderate pace of purchases.  Participants generally 
judged that Treasury bill purchases and the associated 
increase in reserves would, over time, result in a gradual 
reduction in the need for repo operations.  A few partic-
ipants indicated that purchasing Treasury notes and 
bonds with limited remaining maturities could also be 
considered as a way to boost reserves, particularly if the 
Federal Reserve faced constraints on the pace at which 
it could purchase Treasury bills.  Participants generally 
acknowledged some uncertainty over the efficient and 
effective level of reserves and noted it would be prudent 
to continue to monitor money market developments and 
stand ready to adjust the plan as necessary.  Overall, par-
ticipants agreed that the pace of purchases as well as the 
parameters of the repo operations were technical details 

of monetary policy implementation not intended to af-
fect the stance of monetary policy and should be com-
municated as such.   

Most participants preferred not to wait until the Octo-
ber 29–30 FOMC meeting to issue a public statement 
regarding the planned Treasury bill purchases and repo 
operations.  They noted that releasing a statement before 
the October 29–30 FOMC meeting would help rein-
force the point that these actions were technical and not 
intended to affect the stance of policy.  In addition, a few 
participants remarked that an earlier release would allow 
the Desk to begin boosting the level of reserves sooner.  
A couple of participants, however, wanted to wait until 
the October 29–30 FOMC meeting to announce the 
plan so as not to surprise market participants or lead 
them to infer that the Committee regarded the situation 
as dire and thus requiring immediate action.  The Chair 
proposed having the staff produce a draft statement that 
the Committee could comment on early in the following 
week.  Formal approval could occur by notation vote 
with an anticipated release of a statement to the public 
on October 11, 2019. 

Participants discussed longer-term issues that the Com-
mittee might want to study once the near-term plan was 
in place.  In particular, many participants mentioned that 
the Committee may want to continue its previous dis-
cussion of a standing repo facility as a part of the long-
run implementation framework.  Almost all of these par-
ticipants noted that such a facility was an option to pro-
vide a backstop to buffer shocks that could adversely af-
fect policy implementation, and several of these partici-
pants mentioned the potential for the facility to support 
banks’ liquidity risk management while reducing the de-
mand for reserves.  Other participants, instead, high-
lighted that policy implementation had worked well with 
larger quantities of reserves and focused their discussion 
on actions to firmly establish an ample supply of reserves 
over the longer run. A number of participants noted that 
a discussion of a broader range of factors that affect the 
level and volatility of reserves may be appropriate at a 
future meeting. 

On October 11, 2019, the Committee approved by no-
tation vote the following statement that outlines steps to 
ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample so that 
control over the level of the federal funds rate and other 
short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through 
the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates, 
and in which active management of the supply of re-
serves is not required.

STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POL-
ICY IMPLEMENTATION 
(Adopted October 11, 2019) 

Consistent with its January 2019 Statement Regarding 
Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet 
Normalization, the Committee reaffirms its intention to 
implement monetary policy in a regime in which an am-
ple supply of reserves ensures that control over the level 
of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest 
rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the 
Federal Reserve’s administered rates, and in which active 
management of the supply of reserves is not required.  
To ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample, the 
Committee approved by notation vote completed on 
October 11, 2019, the following steps: 

• In light of recent and expected increases in the Fed-
eral Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Federal Re-
serve will purchase Treasury bills at least into the 
second quarter of next year in order to maintain 
over time ample reserve balances at or above the 
level that prevailed in early September 2019. 

• In addition, the Federal Reserve will conduct term 
and overnight repurchase agreement operations at 
least through January of next year to ensure that the 
supply of reserves remains ample even during peri-
ods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and 
to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that 
could adversely affect policy implementation. 

These actions are purely technical measures to support 
the effective implementation of the FOMC’s monetary 
policy, and do not represent a change in the stance of 
monetary policy.  The Committee will continue to mon-
itor money market developments as it assesses the level 
of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective 
policy implementation.  The Committee stands ready to 
adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster ef-
ficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. 

In connection with these plans, the Federal Open 
Market Committee voted unanimously to authorize and 
direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until in-
structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System 
Open Market Account in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive: 

“Effective October 15, 2019, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  In light of recent and ex-
pected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-

reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the 
Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the 
second quarter of next year to maintain over 
time ample reserve balances at or above the 
level that prevailed in early September 2019.   
The Committee also directs the Desk to con-
duct term and overnight repurchase agreement 
operations at least through January of next year 
to ensure that the supply of reserves remains 
ample even during periods of sharp increases in 
non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of 
money market pressures that could adversely af-
fect policy implementation.  In addition, the 
Committee directs the Desk to conduct over-
night reverse repurchase operations (and re-
verse repurchase operations with maturities of 
more than one day when necessary to accom-
modate weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, 
in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury 
securities and to continue reinvesting all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.  Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in Treasury securities to roughly match 
the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.”
