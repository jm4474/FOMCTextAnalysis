11/17/81

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that 
real GNP is declining appreciably in the current quarter and 
that prices on the average are rising somewhat less rapidly 
than over the first three quarters of the year. In October 
the nominal value of total retail sales dropped; industrial 
production fell more than in September; and nonfarm payroll 
employment, especially in manufacturing, declined sharply.  
The unemployment rate rose from 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent.  
Housing starts edged down in September from an already de
pressed level. Over the first 10 months of 1981, the rise 
in the index of average hourly earnings was less rapid than 
during 1980.  

The weighted average value of the dollar against major 
foreign currencies has declined only a little since early 
October, although U.S. short-term interest rates have declined 
more than foreign rates. A reduced U.S. foreign trade deficit 
in September brought the deficit for the third quarter close 
to the second-quarter rate.  

M1-B (adjusted for estimated shifts into NOW accounts) 
expanded in October almost as much as it had declined in 
September, and growth of M2 picked up. The level of adjusted 
M1-B remained well below the lower end of the Committee's 
range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 
1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 was at 
the upper end of its range for the year. Short-term market 
interest rates have declined substantially since the end of 
September, and bond yields have also dropped from the peaks 
generally reached about then. On October 30 the Board of 
Governors announced a reduction in Federal Reserve basic 
discount rates from 14 to 13 percent. The surcharge on 
frequent borrowings of large depository institutions had 
been reduced from 3 to 2 percentage points on October 9, 
and on November 16 the Board removed the remaining 2 per
centage points.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster 
monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce 
inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a 
sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern 
of international transactions. At its meeting in early 
July, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be 
furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for 
the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth 
quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting.



11/17/81

These ranges included growth of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for 

M-B, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW 
accounts on a nationwide basis, and growth of 6 to 9 
percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 respec
tively. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in 

M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected 
a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid 
assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been 
running at about or somewhat above the upper end of their 
ranges. In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth 
in money over the balance of the year, the Committee ex
pected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the 
lower end of its range. At the same time, growth in the 
broader aggregates might be high in their ranges. The 
associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  
The Committee also tentatively agreed that for the period 
from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 

1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 
5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent 
respectively would be appropriate. These ranges will be 
reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing 
experience with public preferences for NOW and similar 
accounts as well as changing economic and financial 
conditions.  

The Committee, after noting a moderate shortfall in 
growth of M1-B in October from the target path set at the 
last meeting, seeks behavior of reserve aggregates con
sistent with growth of M1-B from October to December at an 
annual rate of about 7 percent (after allowance for the 
impact of flows into NOW accounts) and with growth of M2 
at an annual rate around 11 percent. The Chairman may call 
for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for 
Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives 
and related reserve paths during the period before the next 
meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds 
rate persistently outside a range of 11 to 15 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held 

on Tuesday, December 22, 1981, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
