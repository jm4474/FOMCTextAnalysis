By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York was selected to execute transactions for the System 
Open Market Account (SOMA). 

By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Simon Pot-
ter and Lorie K. Logan to serve at the pleasure of the 
Committee as manager and deputy manager of the 
SOMA, respectively, on the understanding that these se-
lections were subject to their being satisfactory to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

Secretary’s note:  Advice subsequently was re-
ceived that the manager and deputy manager se-
lections indicated above were satisfactory to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic 
Open Market Operations was approved with a nonsub-
stantive amendment that changed terminology used in 
paragraph 4.B.ii, related to the provision of intraday 
credit to Foreign Accounts in exchange for securities.  
The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market 
Operations in Federal-Agency Issues remained sus-
pended. 
 

AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC 
OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 
(As amended effective January 26, 2016) 

1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to 
carry out the most recent domestic policy directive 
adopted  by the Committee: 

A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that 
are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin-
cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities 
that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by, any agency of the United 

States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu-
rities”) for the System Open Market Account 
(“SOMA”): 

i. As an outright operation with securities dealers 
and foreign and international accounts maintained 
at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de-
livery basis (including such transactions as are com-
monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) 
at market prices; or 
ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or 
deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se-
curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo 
transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub-
ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo 
transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, 
at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the 
Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, 
after applying reasonable limitations on the volume 
of agreements with individual counterparties; 

B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma-
ture without replacement;  
C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection 
with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in 
the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible 
Securities that are direct obligations of the United 
States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the United States; and 
D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible 
Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United 
States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct 
obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed 
as to principal and interest by that agency. 

2. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graph 1 from time to time for the purpose of testing op-
erational readiness, subject to the following limitations: 

A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 2 
shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-
tee; 
B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au-
thorized in this paragraph 2 that are of the type de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.i shall not exceed $5 billion 
per calendar year; and 
C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.ii shall not exceed $5 billion 
at any given time. 

3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se-
lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu-
rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2016 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

(except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi-
ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). 

A. Such securities lending must be: 
i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; 
ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the 
objectives of the program; 
iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total 
amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that 
may be auctioned; and 
iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the 
amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower 
may borrow. 

B. The Selected Bank may: 
i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis-
cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a 
single issue;  
ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral 
for any loan of securities authorized in this para-
graph 3; and 
iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a 
loan of agency securities authorized in this para-
graph 3. 

4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, while assisting in the provision of 
short-term investments or other authorized services for 
foreign central bank and international accounts main-
tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac-
counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec-
tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the 
Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com-
mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on 
terms comparable to those available in the open market:  

A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake 
reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in 
the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 
65 business days or less; and 
B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus-
tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, 
when appropriate and subject to all other necessary 
authorization and approvals, to:  

i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi-
ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo 
transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus-
tomer Accounts; and  
ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi-
ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. 

Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un-
der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a 
service fee when appropriate.  Transactions undertaken 
with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori-
zation or approval of other entities, including the Board 

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when 
involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United 
States Department of the Treasury. 
5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the 
Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur-
ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to 
instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com-
mittee to: 

A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances 
the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that 
may result in material changes in the composition and 
size of the assets in the SOMA; or  
B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible 
Securities in order to appropriately address temporary 
disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature 
in U.S. dollar funding markets. 

Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of 
this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the 
Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of 
policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s 
long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and 
price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, 
and monetary developments since the most recent meet-
ing of the Committee.  The Chairman, whenever feasi-
ble, will consult with the Committee before making any 
instruction under this paragraph 5. 
 
The manager noted that the staff was in the process of 
evaluating the current framework for foreign reserves 
management and considering a possible restructuring of 
the documents governing the framework for foreign op-
erations.  He recommended that any changes to these 
documents be postponed until that process was com-
plete.  The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm 
without change the Authorization for Foreign Currency 
Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the 
Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Cur-
rency Operations as shown below.  The votes to reaffirm 
these documents included approval of the System’s 
warehousing agreement with the U.S. Treasury. 
 
AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY 
OPERATIONS 
(As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2016) 

1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Mar-
ket Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the 
Committee’s foreign currency directive and express au-
thorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

conformity with such procedural instructions as the 
Committee may issue from time to time: 

A. To purchase and sell the following foreign cur-
rencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or 
forward transactions on the open market at home and 
abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, 
with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established 
by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with 
foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements, and with other international fi-
nancial institutions: 

 
Australian dollars 
Brazilian reais 
Canadian dollars 
Danish kroner 
euro 
Japanese yen 
Korean won 
Mexican pesos 
New Zealand dollars 
Norwegian kroner 
Pounds sterling 
Singapore dollars 
Swedish kronor 
Swiss francs 

 
B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for-
ward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign cur-
rencies listed in paragraph A above. 
C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign 
banks to draw dollars under the arrangements listed in 
paragraph 2 below, in accordance with the Procedural 
Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Oper-
ations. 
D. To maintain an overall open position in all for-
eign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this 
purpose, the overall open position in all foreign cur-
rencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net 
positions in individual currencies, excluding changes 
in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate move-
ments and interest accruals.  The net position in a sin-
gle foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances 
in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future 
receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future deliv-
ery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements 
with due regard to sign. 

2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to main-
tain for the System Open Market Account (subject to the 
requirements of section 214.5 of Regulation N, Rela-
tions with Foreign Banks and Bankers): 

A. Reciprocal currency arrangements with the fol-
lowing foreign banks: 

Foreign bank  Amount of arrangement 
    (millions of dollars equivalent) 
 
Bank of Canada  2,000 
Bank of Mexico  3,000 
 
B. Standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with 
the following foreign banks:  
 
Bank of Canada 
Bank of England 
Bank of Japan 
European Central Bank 
Swiss National Bank 
 
C. Standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrange-
ments with the following foreign banks:  
 
Bank of Canada 
Bank of England 
Bank of Japan 
European Central Bank 
Swiss National Bank 
 

Dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements 
have no pre-set size limits.  Any new swap arrangements 
shall be referred for review and approval to the Commit-
tee.  All swap arrangements are subject to annual review 
and approval by the Committee.  
3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken 
under paragraph 1.A above shall, unless otherwise ex-
pressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing 
market rates.  For the purpose of providing an invest-
ment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or 
for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or re-
ceived in connection with swap drawings, transactions 
with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-
market exchange rates. 
4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with for-
eign central banks for the coordination of foreign cur-
rency transactions.  In making operating arrangements 
with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign 
currencies, the Selected Bank shall not commit itself to 
maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the 
Committee.  Any agreements or understandings con-
cerning the administration of the accounts maintained 
by the Selected Bank with the foreign banks designated 
by the Board of Governors under section 214.5 of Reg-
ulation N shall be referred for review and approval to 
the Committee. 
5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to en-
sure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet antici-
pated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall

generally have an average duration of no more than 
24 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  Such in-
vestments may include buying or selling outright obliga-
tions of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest 
by, a foreign government or agency thereof; buying such 
securities under agreements for repurchase of such se-
curities; selling such securities under agreements for the 
resale of such securities; and holding various time and 
other deposit accounts at foreign institutions.  In addi-
tion, when appropriate in connection with arrangements 
to provide investment facilities for foreign currency 
holdings, U.S. government securities may be purchased 
from foreign central banks under agreements for repur-
chase of such securities within 30 calendar days. 
6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preced-
ing paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign 
Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) and the 
Committee.  The Subcommittee consists of the Chair-
man and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice 
Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other 
member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or 
in the absence of members of the Board serving on the 
Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the 
Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice 
Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman’s alter-
nate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at 
the request of any member, or at the request of the man-
ager, System Open Market Account (“manager”), for the 
purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated opera-
tions and of consulting with the manager on other mat-
ters relating to the manager’s responsibilities.  At the re-
quest of any member of the Subcommittee, questions 
arising from such reviews and consultations shall be re-
ferred for determination to the Committee. 
7. The Chairman is authorized: 

A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter 
into any needed agreement or understanding with the 
Secretary of the Treasury about the division of respon-
sibility for foreign currency operations between the 
System and the Treasury; 
B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully ad-
vised concerning System foreign currency operations, 
and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters re-
lating to foreign currency operations; 
C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re-
ports and information to the National Advisory Coun-
cil on International Monetary and Financial Policies. 

8. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the 
foreign currency operations for System Account in ac-
cordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Gover-
nors’ Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign 
Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 
1944. 

9. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graphs 1, 2, and 5, and foreign exchange and investment 
transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to 
undertake from time to time for the purpose of testing 
operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such 
transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar 
year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior 
notice to the Committee.

PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT 
TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 
(As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2016) 

In conducting operations pursuant to the authoriza-
tion and direction of the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (the “Committee”) as set forth in the Authorization 
for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Cur-
rency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank selected by 
the Committee to execute open market transactions (the 
“Selected Bank”), through the manager, System Open 
Market Account (“manager”), shall be guided by the fol-
lowing procedural understandings with respect to con-
sultations and clearances with the Committee, the For-
eign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”), 
and the Chairman of the Committee, unless otherwise 
directed by the Committee.  All operations undertaken 
pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly 
to the Committee. 

1.  For the reciprocal currency arrangements au-
thorized in paragraphs 2.A of the Authorization for 
Foreign Currency Operations: 

A. Drawings must be approved by the Subcom-
mittee (or by the Chairman, if the Chairman believes 
that consultation with the Subcommittee is not fea-
sible in the time available) if the swap drawing pro-
posed by a foreign bank does not exceed the larger 
of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the 
swap arrangement. 
B. Drawings must be approved by the Committee 
(or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-
lieves that consultation with the full Committee is 
not feasible in the time available, or by the Chair-
man, if the Chairman believes that consultation with 
the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time availa-
ble) if the swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank 
exceeds the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 per-
cent of the size of the swap arrangement. 
C. The manager shall also consult with the Sub-
committee or the Chairman about proposed swap 
drawings by the System. 
D. Any changes in the terms of existing swap ar-
rangements shall be referred for review and ap-
proval to the Chairman.  The Chairman shall keep 
the Committee informed of any changes in terms, 
and the terms shall be consistent with principles dis-
cussed with and guidance provided by the Commit-
tee. 

2. For the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap 
arrangements authorized in paragraphs 2.B and 2.C of 
the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations: 

A. Drawings must be approved by the Chairman 
in consultation with the Subcommittee.  The Chair-
man or the Subcommittee will consult with the 
Committee prior to the initial drawing on the dollar 
or foreign currency liquidity swap lines if possible 
under the circumstances then prevailing; authority 
to approve subsequent drawings for either the dollar 
or foreign currency liquidity swap lines may be del-
egated to the manager by the Chairman.  
B. Any changes in the terms of existing swap ar-
rangements shall be referred for review and ap-
proval to the Chairman.  The Chairman shall keep 
the Committee informed of any changes in terms, 
and the terms shall be consistent with principles dis-
cussed with and guidance provided by the Commit-
tee.  

3. Any operation must be approved by: 
A. The Subcommittee (or by the Chairman, if the 
Chairman believes that consultation with the Sub-
committee is not feasible in the time available) if it: 

i. Would result in a change in the System’s 
overall open position in foreign currencies ex-
ceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million 
since the most recent regular meeting of the Com-
mittee. 
ii. Would result in a change on any day in the 
System’s net position in a single foreign currency 
exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the 
operation is associated with repayment of swap 
drawings. 
iii. Might generate a substantial volume of trad-
ing in a particular currency by the System, even 
though the change in the System’s net position in 
that currency (as defined in paragraph 1.D of the 
Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations) 
might be less than the limits specified in 3.A.ii. 

B. The Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if 
the Subcommittee believes that consultation with 
the full Committee is not feasible in the time availa-
ble, or by the Chairman, if the Chairman believes 
that consultation with the Subcommittee is not fea-
sible in the time available) if it would result in a 
change in the System’s overall open position in for-
eign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most 
recent regular meeting of the Committee. 

4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graphs 1, 2, and 5 of the Authorization for Foreign 
Currency Operations and foreign exchange and in-
vestment transactions that it may be otherwise author-
ized to undertake from time to time for the purpose

amount of such transactions shall not exceed $2.5 bil-
lion per calendar year.  These transactions shall be 
conducted with prior notice to the Committee. 
 

By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Pro-
gram for Security of FOMC Information (Program) with 
four sets of changes.  These changes consisted of (1) a 
clarification that all Federal Reserve persons, which in-
cludes FOMC participants as well as staff members, 
must receive, review, and agree to abide by the Program 
before gaining access to confidential FOMC infor-
mation, and annually thereafter; (2) a change to provide 
the Chairman flexibility to designate Board staff mem-
bers to make decisions regarding access to FOMC infor-
mation by Board staff; (3) technical changes to improve 
the consistency and accuracy of Program language; and 
(4) changes to the Program’s provisions for handling po-
tential breaches of the Committee’s information security 
rules.  This final set of changes codifies the approach 
used in recent years of promptly referring material po-
tential breaches to the Board’s inspector general (IG).  In 
addition, it incorporates revised language that states that 
the prompt referral to the IG, which would include a re-
quest for an investigation, would be made by the secre-
tary or the Committee’s general counsel, with appropri-
ate consultation with the Chairman, thereby vesting the 
referral responsibility in more than one person and thus 
reducing the possibility of any apparent conflict of inter-
est in making a referral determination. 

At the end of the Committee’s annual disposition of or-
ganizational matters, participants considered a revised 
Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy 
Strategy.  The proposed revisions would clarify that the 
Committee viewed its 2 percent inflation goal as sym-
metric.  In presenting the revised statement on behalf of 
the subcommittee on communications, Governor 
Fischer pointed out that, in a discussion of the statement 
in October 2014, participants had expressed widespread 
agreement that inflation moderately above the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below 
that level were equally costly.  He noted that the pro-
posed language was intended to encompass situations in 
which deviations from the Committee’s inflation objec-
tive were expected to continue for a time and had the 
potential to affect longer-term inflation expectations.  In 
addition to the explicit indication that the Committee 
viewed its inflation objective as symmetric, the revised 
statement would update the reference to participants’ es-
timates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment 
from the most recent Summary of Economic Projec-
tions (SEP), using the median of those projections rather 
than the central tendency. 

Participants noted that the statement reflects an excep-
tionally high degree of consensus and that the threshold 
for amendments should be high; they judged that the re-
visions were important because they would clarify the 
symmetry of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec-
tive and communicate to the public that the objective 
was not a ceiling.  Participants also noted that the pro-
posed new language indicating that the Committee 
would “be concerned if inflation were running persis-
tently above or below” its 2 percent objective would not 
require that participants hold similar views about infla-
tion dynamics; in addition, the proposed language would 
not specify the stance of monetary policy in such circum-
stances but would afford the Committee appropriate 
flexibility in tailoring a policy response to persistent de-
viations from the inflation objective.  Moreover, partici-
pants generally agreed that the proposed new language 
should be interpreted as applying to situations in which 
inflation was seen as likely to remain below or above 
2 percent for a sustained period.  However, one partici-
pant judged that the proposed language could be read as 
referring to current and past deviations from the infla-
tion objective, and argued that the statement should 
more clearly indicate that the Committee’s policy deci-
sions were based on expected future inflation.  A couple 
of others agreed that there were reasons for concerns 
about deviations above or below the 2 percent objective, 
but noted that the reasons for, and degree of, those con-
cerns could differ depending upon the direction of the 
deviation or broader macroeconomic conditions. 

All participants but one supported adopting the pro-
posed amendments.  Participants agreed that it was ap-
propriate to release the amended statement, which is re-
produced below, in advance of the Monetary Policy Report 
and testimony, which were scheduled for mid-February. 

 
STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND 
MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY 
(As amended effective January 26, 2016) 

“The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is 
firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from 
the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta-
ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The 
Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci-
sions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity 
facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households 
and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer-
tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, 
and enhances transparency and accountability, which are 
essential in a democratic society.  

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates 
fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan-
cial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions 
tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  
Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions reflect its 
longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as-
sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the 
financial system that could impede the attainment of the 
Committee’s goals.  

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de-
termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee 
has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  
The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at 
the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change 
in the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the 
Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.  The Committee 
would be concerned if inflation were running persis-
tently above or below this objective.  Communicating 
this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps 
keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, 
thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term 
interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to 
promote maximum employment in the face of signifi-
cant economic disturbances. The maximum level of em-
ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors 
that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar-
ket.  These factors may change over time and may not 
be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be 
appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; ra-
ther, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed 
by assessments of the maximum level of employment, 
recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer-
tain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a 
wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  
Information about Committee participants’ estimates of 
the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem-
ployment is published four times per year in the 
FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.  For ex-
ample, in the most recent projections, the median of 
FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment was 4.9 percent.  

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to 
mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal 
and deviations of employment from the Committee’s as-
sessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are 
generally complementary.  However, under circum-
stances in which the Committee judges that the objec-
tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap-
proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag-
nitude of the deviations and the potentially different 
time horizons over which employment and inflation are 

projected to return to levels judged consistent with its 
mandate. 

The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles 
and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual or-
ganizational meeting each January.” 

 
All Committee members but one voted to adopt the re-
vised statement.  Although Mr. Bullard supported the 
statement without the changes and agreed that the Com-
mittee’s inflation goal is symmetric, he dissented because 
he judged that the amended language was not sufficiently 
focused on expected future deviations of inflation from 
the 2 percent objective.  In addition, because the Com-
mittee’s past behavior had demonstrated the emphasis it 
places on expected future inflation, Mr. Bullard viewed 
the amended language as potentially confusing to the 
public. 

Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market 
Operations, and Policy Normalization 
The SOMA manager reported on developments in do-
mestic and foreign financial markets, including changes 
in the expectations of market participants for the trajec-
tory of monetary policy.  The deputy manager followed 
with a briefing on money market developments and Sys-
tem open market operations conducted by the Open 
Market Desk during the period since the Committee met 
on December 15–16, 2015.  The report included an as-
sessment of the response of money market interest rates 
to the increase in the target range for the federal funds 
rate announced following the December meeting.  Over-
all, the rate increase was implemented smoothly and 
money markets responded as anticipated.  Take-up of 
overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) op-
erations over this period was consistent with that ob-
served in the testing phase of operations over the second 
half of last year.  The deputy manager also reviewed 
plans for reinvestment of the proceeds of upcoming 
maturations of SOMA holdings of Treasury securities, 
for small-value tests of various System operations and 
facilities during 2016, and for quarterly tests of the Term 
Deposit Facility. 

The Committee then resumed its consideration of mat-
ters related to the System’s reverse repurchase agree-
ment (RRP) facilities, focusing in particular on the ap-
propriate aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility go-
ing forward.  Previous communications had indicated 
that the Committee intended to allow aggregate capacity 
of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated after 
policy firming had commenced to support monetary 
policy implementation and expected that it would be ap-
propriate to reduce capacity fairly soon thereafter.  A

staff presentation at this meeting reviewed broad strate-
gies for reintroducing an aggregate cap on ON RRP op-
erations and managing the cap subsequently.  In the dis-
cussion that followed, participants reiterated that the 
Committee expects to phase out the facility when it is no 
longer needed to help control the federal funds rate, and 
they unanimously expressed the view that it would be 
appropriate to reintroduce an aggregate cap on ON RRP 
operations at some point.  Regarding when to do so, par-
ticipants held varied views, but nearly all indicated a pref-
erence for waiting a couple of months or longer before 
making operational adjustments to the facility, in part so 
that the Federal Reserve could gain additional experi-
ence with its policy implementation tools.  Concerning 
the strategy that would be used to cap the ON RRP fa-
cility when the time came, most policymakers favored an 
approach in which a relatively high cap level would be 
imposed initially—though one that nonetheless would 
significantly reduce capacity relative to the current situa-
tion—with the intention of periodically making further 
reductions in the level of the cap as appropriate.  Other 
participants indicated a preference for initially imposing 
a somewhat lower cap.  Some noted that the demand for 
ON RRPs could be reduced by widening the spread be-
tween the interest rate on reserves and the offering rate 
on ON RRPs.  In making these judgments, most policy-
makers emphasized the primacy of maintaining mone-
tary control in setting the appropriate capacity of the ON 
RRP facility for the time being; participants indicated 
that the Committee’s future decisions regarding the size 
and ultimate longevity of the facility should be largely 
driven by considerations of monetary control, although 
other factors, such as financial stability, should also be 
taken into account.  Finally, policymakers also discussed 
the appropriate management of the Federal Reserve’s 
RRP operations over quarter-ends, when private-sector 
cash investment options temporarily and predictably de-
cline and result in temporary downward pressure on 
some money market rates, including the federal funds 
rate.  Several participants indicated a preference for con-
tinuing to take account of such calendar effects in con-
ducting RRPs; some policymakers emphasized, how-
ever, that they do not view such temporary declines in 
the federal funds rate as a materially adverse factor for 
monetary control.  Overall, participants agreed that, for 
some time at least, the Committee would continue to 
provide ample RRPs in some form over quarter-ends, 
including in March. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  

There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account over the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the January 26–27 meet-
ing indicated that labor market conditions continued to 
improve in the fourth quarter of last year even though 
growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared 
to slow.  Consumer price inflation was still running be-
low the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, 
restrained in part by decreases in both energy prices and 
the prices of non-energy imports.  Recent survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little 
changed, on balance, while market-based measures of in-
flation compensation declined further. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substan-
tially in December, and the monthly pace of job gains in 
the fourth quarter as a whole was faster than in the third 
quarter.  The unemployment rate remained at 5.0 per-
cent in December, while both the labor force participa-
tion rate and the employment-to-population ratio in-
creased a little.  The share of workers employed part time 
for economic reasons moved down a bit in December.  
The rates of private-sector job openings, hires, and quits 
were little changed in November.  The four-week mov-
ing average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits was somewhat higher in early January than its 
very low level late last year.  Average hourly earnings for 
all employees increased 2½ percent over the 12 months 
ending in December, about ½ percentage point more 
than over the same period a year earlier. 

Industrial production decreased in November and De-
cember, primarily reflecting the ongoing effects of the 
appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
and the declines in crude oil prices since the middle of 
2014.  Manufacturing output declined, with a step-down 
in the production of motor vehicles and parts from the 
high levels seen earlier last year, while production out-
side of the motor vehicle sector was roughly flat.  Pro-
duction in the mining sector continued to fall, and the 
output of utilities declined, as the weather was unseason-
ably warm.  Automakers’ assembly schedules and 
broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as 
the readings on new orders from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, mostly pointed to a slow pace of 
gains in factory output early this year.  Information on 
drilling activity for crude oil and natural gas in early Jan-
uary was consistent with further declines in mining out-
put. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to have increased at a slower rate in the fourth 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

quarter than in the previous quarter.  Although real PCE 
rose solidly in November, spending had been flat in Oc-
tober.  Moreover, in December the components of the 
nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE edged 
down, and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles, while 
remaining at a high level, declined.  However, recent 
readings on key factors that influence consumer spend-
ing were generally favorable.  Growth in real disposable 
income continued to be solid in November.  House-
holds’ net worth was supported by further strong gains 
in home values through November, although equity 
prices declined in recent months.  Also, consumer senti-
ment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consum-
ers remained at an elevated level in early January. 

Recent information on housing activity was consistent 
with a continued gradual recovery in this sector.  Both 
starts and building permits for new single-family homes 
moved higher, on balance, in November and December, 
and starts of multifamily units also stepped up.  New 
home sales increased modestly in November.  Sales of 
existing homes rose strongly in December, more than 
offsetting an outsized decline in November, which likely 
reflected a change in mortgage regulations that tempo-
rarily held down existing home sales. 

Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property products looked to be 
slower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.  
Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods exclud-
ing aircraft moved down in November.  Forward-look-
ing indicators of equipment spending, such as new or-
ders for nondefense capital goods along with recent 
readings from national and regional surveys of business 
conditions, generally pointed to soft business equipment 
spending in the coming months.  Firms’ nominal spend-
ing for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and 
mining declined somewhat in November.  Indicators of 
spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, 
such as the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, con-
tinued to fall through early January.  The available infor-
mation indicated that inventory investment decreased 
again in the fourth quarter, although there was little evi-
dence that inventory-to-sales ratios were uncomfortably 
high outside of the energy sector. 

Total real government purchases appeared to be about 
flat in the fourth quarter.  Federal government spending 
for defense moved roughly sideways.  State and local 
government payrolls increased somewhat in the fourth 
quarter, while nominal construction spending by these 
governments declined in October and November. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in Novem-
ber, as imports fell more than exports. The value of ex-
ports declined to its lowest level since the beginning of 
2012.  The decrease in imports was widespread across 
categories, with a particularly large decline in the imports 
of consumer goods.  The available trade data suggested 
that net exports continued to weigh on real GDP growth 
in the fourth quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased about ½ percent over the 
12 months ending in November, partly restrained by 
substantial declines in consumer energy prices.  Core 
PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and 
energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same 12-month 
period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of 
non-energy imports and the pass-through of declines in 
energy prices.  Over the 12 months ending in December, 
total consumer prices as measured by the consumer 
price index (CPI) rose ¾ percent, while core CPI infla-
tion was around 2 percent.  Recent survey measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on 
balance.  In early January, the Michigan survey measure 
of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 
10 years ticked up but continued to run near the low end 
of its typical range of the past 15 years.  The Survey of 
Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants 
indicated that the median expectation of CPI inflation 
5 to 10 years ahead was essentially unchanged in January. 

In many foreign economies, real GDP growth in the 
fourth quarter appeared to continue at a pace roughly 
similar to that in the third quarter.  In contrast, economic 
growth weakened in Canada, in part because investment 
spending continued to be weighed down by the effects 
of the sharp decline in oil prices since the middle of 
2014.  Lower oil prices and the slowing in U.S. manufac-
turing activity contributed to a step-down in the rate of 
economic growth in Mexico.  Economic growth slowed 
slightly in China but remained robust, supported by a 
modest pickup in growth of Chinese manufacturing out-
put.  Further declines in energy prices pulled down infla-
tion in many foreign economies in the fourth quarter, 
with inflation falling to near zero in several advanced 
economies. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial conditions tightened over the inter-
meeting period, as turmoil in Chinese financial markets 
and lower oil prices contributed to concerns about pros-
pects for global economic growth and a pullback from 
risky assets.  The increased reluctance to hold risky assets 
was associated with a sharp decline in equity prices and 
a notable widening in risk spreads on corporate bonds.

Treasury yields declined across maturities, reflecting a 
downward revision in the expected path of the federal 
funds rate and likely some increase in safe-haven de-
mands amid the market turbulence.  The dollar appreci-
ated against most foreign currencies. 

The Committee’s decision to raise the target range for 
the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent at the Decem-
ber meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets 
and elicited little reaction in Treasury and interest rate 
futures markets.  The expected path of the federal funds 
rate implied by market quotes on interest-rate derivatives 
moved down notably after year-end; the turbulence in 
global financial markets evidently led investors to expect 
a more gradual increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate than they had previously anticipated.  In line 
with that interpretation, results from the Desk’s January 
Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic-
ipants indicated that, on average, respondents expected 
fewer increases in the target range this year than they had 
projected in December. 

Consistent with the decline in the expected path of the 
federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities 
moved lower over the intermeeting period.  Part of the 
decline likely also reflected an increase in safe-haven de-
mands for low-risk and highly liquid assets amid the tur-
bulence in financial markets.  Measures of forward infla-
tion compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Pro-
tected Securities and inflation swaps fell further. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes declined sharply over the 
intermeeting period, exhibiting a high correlation with 
movements in crude oil prices and foreign equity in-
dexes.  Domestic equity indexes were quite volatile in 
January, and one-month-ahead option-implied volatility 
on the S&P 500 index climbed to the upper end of its 
range of the past few years.  Spreads on corporate bonds 
over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened 
over the intermeeting period, reportedly reflecting in-
creased concerns about corporate credit quality, particu-
larly in the energy sector, and a decline in investors’ will-
ingness to assume risk. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re-
mained accommodative for firms of higher credit quality 
but tightened somewhat for riskier firms.  Investment-
grade bond issuance stayed robust, while speculative-
grade bond issuance was weak.  The growth of commer-
cial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books contin-
ued to be strong, although a modest net percentage of 
banks reported tightening standards for C&I loans to 
large and middle-market firms during the fourth quarter 
in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

(SLOOS).  Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans de-
creased in the fourth quarter amid higher spreads, with 
the most pronounced slowing in relatively risky loans 
such as those earmarked for leveraged buyouts. 

Credit continued to be broadly available in the commer-
cial real estate (CRE) sector.  The growth of CRE loans 
on banks’ balance sheets remained strong in the fourth 
quarter, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (CMBS) continued at a robust pace in Decem-
ber.  However, a moderate net percentage of banks re-
ported in the most recent SLOOS that they had tight-
ened standards on CRE loans during the fourth quarter, 
and credit spreads in CMBS markets continued to widen 
over the intermeeting period. 

Credit conditions for residential mortgages were little 
changed over the intermeeting period.  Credit remained 
tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-   
document income, or high debt-to-income ratios.  Ac-
cording to the January SLOOS, moderate net fractions 
of banks eased standards on several types of home mort-
gages over the past three months and expected to ease 
standards this year. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were 
little changed over the intermeeting period and remained 
accommodative on balance.  Consumer loan balances 
continued to rise at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, 
reflecting further expansions in credit card, auto, and 
student loan balances.  Student and auto loans remained 
broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime 
credit histories, but the availability of credit card loans to 
subprime borrowers was still tight.  Respondents to the 
January SLOOS indicated that, over the past three 
months, they had eased standards and terms on auto 
loans but tightened standards and terms on credit card 
loans. 

Global financial market conditions deteriorated sharply 
in January, as recent developments in Chinese financial 
markets and the further decrease in crude oil prices ap-
peared to increase concerns about global economic 
growth.  Equity prices in emerging market economies 
(EMEs) and in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) fell 
sharply, and 10-year sovereign yields in the AFEs de-
creased substantially.  Market expectations for the policy 
rates of major foreign central banks, which had risen 
somewhat after the December FOMC meeting, ended 
the period lower.  Credit spreads in the EMEs widened.  
The foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar appreci-
ated further against most currencies, with larger in-
creases relative to the currencies of commodity-export-
ing countries.

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability and judged the financial vulnerabilities 
of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance.  
Their assessment reflected strong capital and liquidity 
positions at banks, moderate leverage in the nonbank fi-
nancial sector, and subdued borrowing by households.  
Risk premiums had increased as spreads widened by 
more than was estimated to be necessary to compensate 
for expected losses, suggesting a decline in the willing-
ness of investors to bear credit risk.  However, leverage 
continued to increase in the nonfinancial business sec-
tor, particularly among energy-related and other rela-
tively risky firms.  The high leverage of nonfinancial cor-
porations and the liquidity mismatch at high-yield bond 
mutual funds suggested some elevated risks for bond in-
vestors and lower-rated borrowers. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the 
January FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the fourth 
quarter of last year was estimated to have been markedly 
slower than in the forecast for the December meeting.  
However, the medium-term projection for real GDP 
growth was only slightly lower, on balance, than the pre-
vious forecast.  The staff estimated that the negative ef-
fects of a lower projected path for equity prices and a 
higher assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value 
of the dollar would be mostly offset by the positive ef-
fects of a lower path for crude oil prices and slightly 
more stimulus to aggregate demand from changes in fis-
cal policy than was assumed in the previous forecast.  In 
particular, federal legislation enacted in December unex-
pectedly included both a multiyear extension of the bo-
nus depreciation tax credit for business investment and 
a delay in the introduction of several tax increases related 
to the Affordable Care Act.  The staff continued to pro-
ject that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster 
pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, sup-
ported primarily by increases in consumer spending.  
The unemployment rate was expected to gradually de-
cline further and to run somewhat below the staff’s esti-
mate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was re-
vised down slightly, reflecting recent data for consumer 
prices and the further declines in the price of crude oil; 
the projection for inflation over the medium term was 
little revised.  Energy prices and the prices of non-energy 
imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising 
later this year.  The staff continued to project that infla-
tion would increase gradually over the next several years 
and reach the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 per-
cent by the end of 2018. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its January pro-
jections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation as similar to the average of the past 
20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP were 
seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s as-
sessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well 
positioned to help the economy withstand substantial 
adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of 
economic activity were seen as more pronounced than 
in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty 
about global economic prospects and the financial mar-
ket turbulence in the United States and abroad.  Con-
sistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the 
staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemploy-
ment rate as skewed to the upside.  The risks to the pro-
jection for inflation were seen as weighted to the down-
side, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation 
expectations may have edged down and that the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially fur-
ther, which would put downward pressure on inflation. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants saw the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as suggesting that 
labor market conditions had improved further in late 
2015 even as economic growth slowed.  Household and 
business spending had been increasing at moderate rates; 
however, net exports had been soft and inventory in-
vestment had slowed.  A range of labor market indica-
tors pointed to some additional decline in underutiliza-
tion of labor resources.  Inflation continued to run be-
low the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, 
partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of 
non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation declined further over the intermeet-
ing period; survey-based measures of longer-term infla-
tion expectations were little changed, on balance, in re-
cent months. 

In considering the outlook for economic activity, partic-
ipants weighed the divergent signals from recent 
strength in the labor market and the modest increase in 
real GDP suggested by the available data on spending 
and production.  In part, the projected slow growth of 
real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 appeared to be 
caused by reduced inventory investment and a weather-
related slowing in consumer spending on energy ser-
vices—developments that would likely be reversed in 
the current quarter.  Moreover, some participants noted 
that the preliminary spending data and initial estimates 
of GDP are often revised substantially, and they judged 
that labor market indicators tended to provide a more

reliable early reading on the economy’s underlying 
strength. 

In assessing the medium-term outlook, participants dis-
cussed the extent to which the recent turbulence in 
global financial markets might restrain U.S. economic 
activity.  While acknowledging the possible adverse ef-
fects of the tightening of financial conditions that had 
occurred, most policymakers thought that the extent to 
which tighter conditions would persist and what that 
might imply for the outlook were unclear, and they 
therefore judged that it was premature to alter apprecia-
bly their assessment of the medium-term economic out-
look.  They continued to anticipate that economic activ-
ity would expand at a moderate pace over the medium 
term and that the labor market would continue to 
strengthen.  Inflation was expected to remain low in the 
near term, in part because of the further decline in en-
ergy prices.  However, most participants continued to 
anticipate that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the 
medium term as the transitory effects of declines in en-
ergy and import prices dissipated and the labor market 
strengthened further.  Given their increased uncertainty 
about how global economic and financial developments 
might evolve, participants emphasized the importance 
of closely monitoring these developments and of as-
sessing their implications for the labor market and infla-
tion, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. 

Growth of consumer spending appeared to have slowed 
in the fourth quarter, with the December data showing 
a decline in nominal retail sales and a step-down in pur-
chases of new motor vehicles from the elevated level of 
the preceding three months.  Moreover, households’ 
spending on energy services was evidently held down by 
unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the coun-
try.  Although participants received mixed reports from 
their District contacts on consumer spending, some 
heard that retail activity had been generally positive at 
year-end, and a number of participants relayed indica-
tions that spending on services in their Districts re-
mained solid.  Regarding the outlook for consumer 
spending, a number of participants noted that the recent 
moderation in spending seemed inconsistent with con-
tinued strong gains in households’ real income from ris-
ing employment and falling energy prices and with the 
relatively elevated level of consumer sentiment.  Because 
of these favorable fundamentals, many participants indi-
cated that they still expected consumer spending to con-
tribute importantly to economic growth in the coming 
year.  However, several were concerned that the rise in 
the saving rate since the middle of 2015 might suggest 
an elevated degree of caution about the economic out-

look or that the recent retreat in equity values, if sus-
tained, might damp spending.  Nonetheless, a couple of 
others pointed out that information from surveys of 
consumer sentiment suggested that households, to date, 
had not appeared to be particularly sensitive to changes 
in financial market conditions. 

Housing sales and construction continued to trend up 
though the end of 2015, extending the gradual recovery 
in the housing sector.  In participants’ reports on eco-
nomic conditions in their Districts, some highlighted the 
sector as one in which activity had improved or about 
which contacts were upbeat.  A couple of participants 
noted that new mortgage lending regulations appeared 
to have slowed the mortgage origination process and 
temporarily reduced home sales. 

Manufacturing activity continued to weaken in late 2015.  
Production continued to contract in industries—such as 
steel and heavy machinery—in which demand had been 
negatively affected, either directly or indirectly, by the 
appreciation of the dollar, slow economic growth 
abroad, and declining oil prices.  Participants from those 
Reserve Banks that conduct surveys of manufacturing 
activity reported that the weakness extended into Janu-
ary.  Nonetheless, several participants pointed to aero-
space, autos, and consumer products as areas of strength 
in the manufacturing sector, and a few commented that 
manufacturers surveyed in their Districts were still rela-
tively optimistic about the outlook for 2016.  Infor-
mation on business activity outside of the manufacturing 
sector was mixed.  Commercial construction was re-
ported to be strong in a couple of Districts, and a few 
participants commented that government spending was 
likely to provide a boost to business activity in the com-
ing year.  Several participants reported moderate growth 
in services industries, but a couple noted some slowing 
of activity.  Some participants reported a deterioration in 
business sentiment among their contacts in the wake of 
recent global economic and financial developments, 
which could result in more-cautious capital spending 
plans. 

Downward pressure on domestic energy activity intensi-
fied over the intermeeting period as oil prices dropped 
further.  The imbalance of the supply of crude oil relative 
to demand remained very high and appeared unlikely to 
be resolved quickly, as was evidenced by a further down-
shift in oil futures prices.  Participants’ contacts in the 
energy sector reported that firms were still adjusting to 
lower prices and the contraction in their businesses, and 
some firms expected that they would need to cut invest-
ment and employment further.  In addition, it was noted 
that energy firms continued to face tightening financial

conditions and that financial stress was building for 
those with high levels of debt.  In agriculture, depressed 
levels of crop prices and weak global demand continued 
to weaken farm income. 

A broad range of indicators showed ongoing improve-
ment in labor market conditions.  Most notably, in-
creases in nonfarm payroll employment were quite 
strong during the final three months of 2015.  Although 
the unemployment rate, at 5.0 percent, was unchanged 
over that period, it was at a level close to or below most 
participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal rate.  
Moreover, the labor force participation rate and the em-
ployment-to-population rate moved up toward year-end.  
Many viewed labor market underutilization as having 
been substantially reduced over the past year, and a few 
saw slack as having been largely eliminated.  In their 
comments on labor market conditions, participants cited 
strong employment gains, low levels of unemployment 
in their Districts, reports of shortages of workers in var-
ious industries, or firming in wage increases.  Most an-
ticipated that employment would expand at a solid rate 
over the year ahead, although several saw the prospect 
of some moderation in employment gains from the par-
ticularly large increases in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Participants discussed the implications of the further de-
cline in the prices of oil and other commodities and the 
additional appreciation of the dollar since the previous 
FOMC meeting for the outlook for inflation.  They 
agreed that these developments would keep inflation low 
in the near term but offered a range of views on the ef-
fects on the medium-term outlook and the risks attend-
ing the outlook.  Most continued to anticipate that once 
the price of energy and the exchange value of the dollar 
stabilized, the effects of those factors on inflation would 
fade.  Several saw that outlook as depending importantly 
on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an 
above-trend pace of economic activity.  Moreover, some 
emphasized the need for longer-run inflation expecta-
tions to remain well anchored.  In that regard, while 
some participants interpreted the recent readings on  
survey-based measures of inflation expectations and 
market-based measures of inflation compensation as 
suggesting that long-term inflation expectations were 
still relatively well anchored, some others expressed con-
cern about the further decline in inflation compensation 
recently and the historically low levels of some survey 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations.  Some 
noted the difficulty of distinguishing declines in ex-
pected inflation embedded in those market-based 
measures from changes in risk and liquidity premiums or 
of interpreting the current high correlation of far-for-
ward measures of inflation compensation and oil prices.  

Although most participants continued to expect that in-
flation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term, a number of participants indi-
cated that, in light of recent developments, they viewed 
the outlook for inflation as somewhat more uncertain or 
saw the risks as being to the downside.  Several partici-
pants reiterated the importance of monitoring inflation 
developments closely to confirm that inflation was 
evolving along the path anticipated by the Committee. 

Regarding the foreign economic outlook, it was noted 
that the slowdown in China’s industrial sector and the 
decline in global commodity prices could restrain eco-
nomic activity in the EMEs and other commodity-     
producing countries for some time.  Participants dis-
cussed recent developments in China, including the pos-
sibility that structural changes and financial imbalances 
in the Chinese economy might lead to a sharper deceler-
ation in economic growth in that country than was gen-
erally anticipated.  Such a downshift, if it occurred, could 
increase the economic and financial stresses on other 
EMEs and on commodity producers, including Canada 
and Mexico.  Moreover, global financial markets could 
continue to be affected by uncertainty about China’s ex-
change rate regime.  While the exposure of the United 
States to the Chinese economy through direct trade ties 
was limited, a number of participants were concerned 
about the potential drag on the U.S. economy from the 
broader effects of a greater-than-expected slowdown in 
China and other EMEs. 

Participants also discussed a range of issues related to 
financial market developments.  Almost all participants 
cited a number of recent events as indicative of tighter 
financial conditions in the United States; these events in-
cluded declines in equity prices, a widening in credit 
spreads, a further rise in the exchange value of the dollar, 
and an increase in financial market volatility.  Some par-
ticipants also pointed to significantly tighter financing 
conditions for speculative-grade firms and small busi-
nesses, and to reports of tighter standards at banks for 
C&I and CRE loans.  The effects of these financial de-
velopments, if they were to persist, may be roughly 
equivalent to those from further firming in monetary 
policy.  Participants mentioned several apparent factors 
underlying the recent financial market turbulence, in-
cluding economic and financial developments in China 
and other foreign countries, spillovers in financial mar-
kets from stresses at firms and in countries that are pro-
ducers of energy and other commodities, and an increase 
in concerns among market participants regarding the 
prospects for domestic economic growth.  However, a 
number of participants noted that the large magnitude 
of changes in domestic financial market conditions was

difficult to reconcile with incoming information on U.S. 
economic developments.  A couple of participants 
pointed out that the recent decline in equity prices could 
be viewed as bringing equity valuations more in line with 
historical norms.  Additionally, a few participants cau-
tioned that valuations in CRE markets should be closely 
monitored.  The effects of a relatively flat yield curve and 
low interest rates in reducing banks’ net interest margins 
were also noted. 

Participants discussed whether their current assessments 
of economic conditions and the medium-term outlook 
warranted either increasing the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at this meeting or altering their earlier 
views of the appropriate path for the target range for the 
federal funds rate.  Participants agreed that incoming in-
dicators regarding labor market developments had been 
encouraging, but also that data releases since the Decem-
ber meeting on spending and production had been dis-
appointing.  Furthermore, developments in commodity 
and financial markets as well as the possibility of a sig-
nificant weakening of some foreign economies had the 
potential to further restrain domestic economic activity, 
partly because the large cumulative declines in energy 
and other commodity prices could have pronounced ad-
verse effects on some firms and countries that are im-
portant producers of such commodities.  However, a 
few noted that the potential positive effects of lower en-
ergy costs on economic activity were a mitigating factor.  
Participants judged that the overall implication of these 
developments for the outlook for domestic economic 
activity was unclear, but they agreed that uncertainty had 
increased, and many saw these developments as increas-
ing the downside risks to the outlook. 

As expected, inflation had continued to run below 2 per-
cent, but the further decline in energy prices and the ad-
ditional appreciation of the dollar likely implied that in-
flation would take somewhat longer than previously an-
ticipated to rise to the Committee’s objective.  It was 
noted that although it was generally appropriate for 
monetary policy not to respond substantially to tempo-
rary shocks to inflation, that prescription depended in 
part on the assumption that longer-term inflation expec-
tations remained well anchored.  Participants pointed 
out that some market-based measures of longer-term in-
flation compensation had declined to historically low 
levels, which increased concerns about whether inflation 
expectations could be moving lower.  Other participants, 
however, noted that survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations had remained fairly steady, 
and a few participants characterized measures of under-
lying inflation rates, such as core and trimmed mean 
PCE inflation, as having stayed relatively stable.  Most 

participants still expected inflation to increase gradually 
once energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports 
stabilized and as the labor market strengthened further.  
However, a few participants noted that direct evidence 
that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an 
important element of their assessment of the outlook 
and of the appropriate path for policy.   

Participants expressed a range of views regarding the 
balance of risks to the medium-term economic outlook 
and its implications for the conduct of monetary policy.  
Most participants indicated that it was difficult to judge 
at this point whether the outlook for inflation and eco-
nomic growth had changed materially, but they thought 
that uncertainty surrounding the outlook had increased 
as a result of recent financial and economic develop-
ments.  Most participants were of the view that there was 
not yet enough evidence to indicate whether the balance 
of risks to the medium-term outlook had changed mate-
rially, but others judged that recent developments had 
increased the level of downside risks or that the risks 
were no longer balanced. 

Several participants noted that monetary policy was less 
well positioned to respond effectively to shocks that re-
duce inflation or real activity than to upside shocks, and 
that waiting for additional information regarding the un-
derlying strength of economic activity and prospects for 
inflation before taking the next step to reduce policy ac-
commodation would be prudent.  While participants 
continued to expect that gradual adjustments in the 
stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, they 
emphasized that the timing and pace of adjustments will 
depend on future economic and financial market devel-
opments and their implications for the medium-term 
economic outlook.  A couple of participants questioned 
whether some financial market participants fully appre-
ciated that monetary policy is data dependent, and a 
number of participants emphasized the importance of 
continuing to communicate this aspect of monetary pol-
icy. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in December suggested that labor 
market conditions had improved further even as eco-
nomic growth slowed late last year.  Members noted that 
a range of recent labor market indicators, including 
strong job gains, pointed to some additional decline in 
the underutilization of labor resources.  Members also 
agreed that household spending and business fixed in-
vestment had been increasing at moderate rates in recent 
months, and the housing sector had improved further; 

Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

however, net exports had been soft and inventory in-
vestment had slowed.  Members noted that inflation 
continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy 
prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation had declined 
further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent 
months.  Members expected that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions would continue to strengthen. 

In assessing whether economic conditions had im-
proved sufficiently to warrant a further increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, 
members agreed that labor market data had generally 
been stronger than anticipated at the time of the Decem-
ber meeting, and some members noted that wage growth 
had picked up.  However, the spending and production 
data generally had been disappointing—in particular, in-
formation regarding indicators of manufacturing activ-
ity, consumption expenditures, and inventory invest-
ment.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, the additional 
sharp declines in energy prices and strengthening of the 
exchange value of the dollar since the December meet-
ing were likely to hold down inflation for longer than 
previously anticipated, but inflation was expected to in-
crease gradually as energy prices and the prices of non-
energy imports stabilized and the labor market strength-
ened further.  A couple of members emphasized that di-
rect evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent 
would be an important element of their assessments of 
the appropriate timing of further policy firming. 

In discussing the appropriate path for the target range 
for the federal funds rate over the medium term, mem-
bers agreed that it would be important to closely monitor 
global economic and financial developments and to con-
tinue to assess their implications for the labor market 
and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.  
Members expressed a range of views regarding the im-
plications of recent economic and financial develop-
ments for the degree of uncertainty about the medium-
term outlook, with many members judging that uncer-
tainty had increased.  Members generally agreed that the 
implications of the available information were not suffi-
ciently clear to allow members to assess the balance of 
risks to the economic outlook in the Committee’s 
postmeeting statement.  However, members observed 
that if the recent tightening of global financial conditions 
was sustained, it could be a factor amplifying downside 
risks. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncer-
tainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to 
leave the target range for the federal funds rate un-
changed at ¼ to ½ percent.  The Committee also main-
tained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and 
of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, 
and it anticipated that it would be appropriate to con-
tinue this reinvestment policy until normalization of the 
level of the federal funds rate was well under way.  This 
policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain ac-
commodative financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective January 28, 2016, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake 
open market operations as necessary to maintain 
the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to 
½ percent, including overnight reverse repur-
chase operations (and reverse repurchase opera-
tions with maturities of more than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or 
similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 
0.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value 
of Treasury securities held outright in the System 
Open Market Account that are available for such 
operations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue roll-
ing over maturing Treasury securities at auction 
and to continue reinvesting principal payments 
on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in December suggests 
that labor market conditions improved further 
even as economic growth slowed late last year.  

Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2016 Page 17_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

Household spending and business fixed invest-
ment have been increasing at moderate rates in 
recent months, and the housing sector has im-
proved further; however, net exports have been 
soft and inventory investment slowed.  A range 
of recent labor market indicators, including 
strong job gains, points to some additional de-
cline in underutilization of labor resources.  Infla-
tion has continued to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting 
declines in energy prices and in prices of non-en-
ergy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation 
compensation declined further; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
are little changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and 
price stability.  The Committee currently expects 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand at 
a moderate pace and labor market indicators will 
continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to 
remain low in the near term, in part because of 
the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 
2 percent over the medium term as the transitory 
effects of declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate and the labor market strengthens fur-
ther.  The Committee is closely monitoring global 
economic and financial developments and is as-
sessing their implications for the labor market and 
inflation, and for the balance of risks to the out-
look. 

Given the economic outlook, the Committee de-
cided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of mon-
etary policy remains accommodative, thereby 
supporting further improvement in labor market 
conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds 
rate, the Committee will assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  This assessment will take into account a 
wide range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expectations, and readings 
on financial and international developments.  In 
light of the current shortfall of inflation from 
2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation 

goal.  The Committee expects that economic con-
ditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; 
the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securities 
and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normali-
zation of the level of the federal funds rate is well 
under way.  This policy, by keeping the Commit-
tee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable 
levels, should help maintain accommodative fi-
nancial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer, 
Esther L. George, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, 
Eric Rosengren, and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors took no action to change the 
interest rates on reserves or discount rates. 

Potential Enhancements to the Summary of 
Economic Projections  
Next, participants considered a proposal by the subcom-
mittee on communications to add to the SEP several 
charts that would illustrate the uncertainty that attends 
participants’ macroeconomic projections.  A staff brief-
ing reviewed the subcommittee’s proposal, noting that 
these so-called fan charts could be constructed largely 
from information on historical errors from government 
and private-sector forecasts that is already provided in 
the SEP, thereby making it easy to explain the new charts 
to the public; in addition, the inclusion of a fan chart for 
the federal funds rate could help convey to the public 
that the future path of monetary policy is uncertain and 
will depend on economic and financial developments.  
The subcommittee had considered other approaches but 
opted to recommend a simple method similar to that fol-
lowed by some foreign central banks. 

Participants expressed a range of views regarding the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of including fan charts in the 
SEP.  On the one hand, these charts would enhance the 

Page 18 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

Committee’s communications by providing a visual rep-
resentation of the uncertainty surrounding the median 
projections for each variable, although it was noted that 
the meeting minutes and the SEP already provide infor-
mation about participants’ assessments of the uncer-
tainty regarding the economic outlook.  In addition, fan 
charts would help illustrate that the dispersion of partic-
ipants’ projections was usually modest relative to the un-
certainty that attends macroeconomic forecasts.  More-
over, a number of participants noted that the simple ap-
proach that the subcommittee was recommending 
would be more straightforward to explain to the public 
than the other options considered by the subcommittee 
and could be modified over time to incorporate greater 
complexity—for instance, by showing that the magni-
tude of uncertainty above the median projection was not 
necessarily equal to the magnitude of uncertainty below 
it.  On the other hand, some participants thought that 
the proposed fan charts still could be challenging for the 
general public to interpret.  It was also noted that other 
central banks that employ fan charts typically display un-
certainty around a staff forecast or policymakers’ con-
sensus forecast, but that the median SEP projections do 
not necessarily represent the Committee’s collective 
view.  Moreover, the typical magnitude of the historical 
forecast errors used to construct the proposed fan charts 
could well differ from participants’ judgments about un-
certainty going forward—information that is already in-
cluded in the SEP—and this difference could be difficult 
to explain. 

With regard to including a fan chart to illustrate the un-
certainty surrounding the path of the policy interest rate, 

a fan chart for the federal funds rate might be helpful in 
explaining that future monetary policy is necessarily un-
certain and will depend upon economic and financial de-
velopments.  However, participants raised several ques-
tions, including whether the band around the federal 
funds rate path should extend below zero, how any fu-
ture forward guidance would be represented in this 
framework, and whether it would be appropriate to in-
clude a fan chart for the federal funds rate in light of the 
Committee’s role in setting the policy target. 

At the end of the discussion, the Chair noted that further 
work might be helpful to address participants’ concerns 
and asked the subcommittee on communications to con-
tinue to investigate the possibility of incorporating a 
graphical depiction of uncertainty into the SEP. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 15–16, 
2016.  The meeting adjourned at 12:25 p.m. on 
January 27, 2016. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on January 5, 2016, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on December 16–17, 2015.
