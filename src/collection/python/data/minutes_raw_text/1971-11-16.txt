By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Govern

ment securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during 

the period October 19 through November 15, 1971, were approved, 

ratified, and confirmed.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the 

Committee, to executive transactions in the System Account in 

accordance with the following current economic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
that real output of goods and services expanded mod
estly in the third quarter, but greater growth appears 
in prospect for the current quarter. Although the 
unemployment rate has declined recently, it remains 
high. Available data indicate that the 90-day freeze 
effectively limited increases in price and wages, and 
basic policies for the post-freeze stabilization program 
have been announced. The narrowly defined money stock 
declined further in October, but inflows of consumer
type time and savings deposits to banks expanded consid
erably and the broadly defined money stock increased 
moderately. Expansion in the bank credit proxy slowed 
substantially as the volume of large-denomination CD's 
outstanding rose less than in September and as U.S. Gov
ernment deposits were reduced. Interest rates on both 
short- and long-term market securities have continued 
to decline in recent weeks and Federal Reserve discount 
rates were reduced by one-quarter of a percentage point to 
4-3/4 per cent. The U.S. foreign trade balance was 
raised in September by a sharp acceleration of export 
shipments in advance of an East Coast port strike. In 
recent weeks net outflows of short-term capital appar
ently have diminished further, market exchange rates 
for foreign currencies against the dollar on average 
have not changed much, and foreign official reserve 
holdings have increased less than they did in September.  
In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy 
of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial 
conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental 
program, including sustainable real economic growth and



11/16/71

increased employment, abatement of inflationary 
pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium 
in the country's balance of payments.  

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks 
to promote somewhat greater growth in monetary and credit 

aggregates over the months ahead. System open market 
operations until the next meeting of the Committee 
shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank 
reserve and money market conditions consistent with 
that objective.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open 

Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 14, 1971, 

at 9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
