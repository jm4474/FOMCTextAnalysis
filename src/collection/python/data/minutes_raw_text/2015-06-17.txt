Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Mar-
ket Account (SOMA) reported on developments in do-
mestic and foreign financial markets.  The manager also 
discussed System open market operations conducted by 
the Open Market Desk during the period since the Com-
mittee met on April 28–29.  The Desk’s overnight re-
verse repurchase agreement (RRP) operations continued 
to provide a soft floor for money market interest rates.  
The manager updated the Committee on plans for term 
RRP operations at the end of the second quarter and 
noted that testing of the Federal Reserve’s Term Deposit 
Facility continued.  The manager also reviewed the rein-
vestment policy for maturing Treasury securities.  Spe-
cifically, at Treasury auctions, the Desk rolls over the 
maturing securities held in the SOMA into newly issued 
securities in proportion to the issue amounts of the new 
securities, and the Federal Reserve receives the interest 
rate determined competitively in the public auction of 
the newly issued securities.  

The manager updated the Committee on tentative plans 
to improve the calculation of the effective federal funds 
rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York.  The effective federal funds rate, currently defined 
as the volume-weighted mean of interest rates on federal 
funds transactions, would be redefined as the volume-
weighted median.  Staff analysis suggested that the      
volume-weighted median would usually differ little from 
the volume-weighted mean, but that the median would 
be a more robust statistic when some trades occur at in-
terest rates that are unrepresentative of general market 
conditions or when there are data problems such as re-
porting errors.  The change in approach would be imple-
mented next year in conjunction with the transition to 
the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420) 
as the data source for the calculation of the effective fed-
eral funds rate.  A volume-weighted median would also 
be used to construct a representative measure of condi-
tions in the broader set of markets covered by the new

overnight bank funding rate.4  The manager noted that 
additional background information on these changes 
would be published by the Desk shortly following the 
release of the minutes from this meeting.  Participants 
expressed no objections to the proposal. 

The staff also provided an update to the Committee on 
a review of the current system of primary dealers and the 
Desk’s overall framework for establishing, maintaining, 
and publishing information on the Federal Reserve’s 
counterparty relationships for operations in both do-
mestic and foreign financial markets.  While the current 
sets of counterparties were performing well and meeting 
the Desk’s needs, the staff noted that it would report 
back to the Committee in the future should potential en-
hancements to the counterparty framework be identi-
fied.  The Desk anticipated that it would conduct regular 
reviews of the counterparty framework approximately 
every three years in the future. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open 
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet-
ing period.  There were no intervention operations in 
foreign currencies for the System’s account over the in-
termeeting period. 

The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discus-
sion of developments in financial markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s balance sheet. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the June 16–17 meeting 
suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was 
increasing moderately in the second quarter after edging 
down in the first quarter.  Labor market conditions im-
proved somewhat further in recent months.  Consumer 
price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent and was restrained sig-
nificantly by earlier declines in energy prices and de-
creases in prices of non-energy imports.  Survey 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained 
stable, while market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation were still low. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a faster 
pace in April and May than in the first quarter.  The un-
employment rate was 5.5 percent in May, about the same 

                                                 
4 On February 2, 2015, in addition to announcing preliminary 
plans to improve the calculation of the effective federal funds 
rate, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated that it 
planned to begin to publish an additional interest rate, the 
overnight bank funding rate, which will be based on both fed-
eral funds transactions and the Eurodollar transactions of 
U.S.-managed banking offices. 

as its first-quarter average.  The labor force participation 
rate and the employment-to-population ratio rose a bit 
over April and May, and the share of workers employed 
part time for economic reasons edged down on net.  The 
rate of private-sector job openings moved up a little, on 
balance, in March and April, while the rates of hiring and 
quits were essentially unchanged. 

Industrial production decreased during April and May 
after declining in the first quarter.  The output of both 
the manufacturing and mining sectors fell over the past 
two months, likely reflecting the continuing effects of 
earlier increases in the foreign exchange value of the dol-
lar and lower crude oil prices.  Automakers’ assembly 
schedules suggested that light motor vehicle production 
would increase at a solid pace in the near term, but 
broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as 
the readings on new orders from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, generally pointed to modest 
gains in factory output in the coming months. 

Growth in real personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) appeared to pick up early in the second quarter 
from its modest pace in the previous quarter.  The com-
ponents of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bu-
reau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of 
PCE increased in May, and the data for sales in the pre-
vious two months were revised up.  Sales of light motor 
vehicles were much higher in May than in April.  Among 
the factors that influence household spending, real dis-
posable income rose in April and gains in households’ 
net worth were supported by further advances in home 
values.  Moreover, consumer sentiment in the University 
of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in early June re-
mained near its highest level since prior to the most re-
cent recession. 

Activity in the housing sector improved somewhat in re-
cent months but continued to be slow.  Starts and build-
ing permits of both new single-family homes and multi-
family units increased, on balance, in April and May.  
Sales of new homes rose in April; existing home sales 
moved down, although pending home sales increased. 

 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 16–17, 2015 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property products appeared to re-
main relatively slow in the second quarter.  Nominal 
shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air-
craft rose in April.  Forward-looking indicators, such as 
new orders for these capital goods along with national 
and regional surveys of business conditions, pointed to 
only modest increases in business equipment spending 
in the near term.  Firms’ nominal spending for nonresi-
dential structures excluding drilling and mining rose in 
April.  In contrast, the number of oil rigs in operation 
continued to fall through early June, suggesting a further 
decline in real business spending for drilling and mining 
structures in the second quarter. 

Nominal federal spending data for April and May 
pointed toward a further decline in real federal govern-
ment purchases in the second quarter.  Real state and 
local government purchases appeared to be rising in the 
second quarter, with increases in both payrolls and nom-
inal construction spending in recent months. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially 
in March but narrowed in April, leaving the deficit mod-
estly wider than in February.  After decreasing for four 
straight months, exports increased in both March and 
April, as shipments to Asia picked up following the res-
olution in February of labor disputes at West Coast 
ports.  Imports rebounded in March from the depressed 
levels in January and February but fell back in April, 
close to the first-quarter average.  While real net exports 
made a large negative contribution to the change in real 
GDP in the first quarter of 2015, April data suggested 
that net exports might be a considerably smaller drag on 
GDP growth in the second quarter of the year. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, only edged up over the 12 months ending in 
April, held down primarily by earlier large declines in en-
ergy prices.  Core PCE inflation, which excludes food 
and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same           
12-month period, restrained in part by declines in the 
prices of non-energy imports.  Measures of expected 
longer-run inflation from a number of surveys, including 
the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Fore-
casters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, re-
mained stable.  However, market-based measures of in-
flation compensation were still low, although somewhat 
higher than early in the year.  Measures of labor com-
pensation rose at moderate rates, outpacing the rise in 
consumer prices over the past year.  The employment 
cost index increased 2¾ percent over the four quarters 
ending in the first quarter, while compensation per hour 

in the nonfarm business sector rose 1¾ percent over the 
same period.  Average hourly earnings for all employees 
increased 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in May.  
There were some tentative signs that these labor com-
pensation measures were accelerating a little in the first 
quarter. 

Economic growth in many foreign economies slowed in 
the first quarter.  Real GDP contracted in Canada, where 
lower oil prices depressed investment, and in Brazil, 
where business and consumer confidence weakened and 
high inflation prompted a significant tightening of mon-
etary policy.  In addition, real GDP growth slowed in 
China and Mexico.  By contrast, the euro-area economy 
continued its recovery, and real GDP growth in Japan 
increased sharply.  Inflation rates turned positive in re-
cent months in many foreign economies following the 
trough in oil prices earlier this year. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Over the intermeeting period, longer-term Treasury 
yields increased notably amid heightened volatility, ap-
parently boosted by a rise in yields on core euro-area 
sovereign bonds and, to a lesser extent, stronger-than-
anticipated news about the U.S. labor market late in the 
period.  The sharp rise in yields on core euro-area sov-
ereign bonds seemed to reflect a notable rise in term pre-
miums from significantly compressed levels as well as an 
increase in the path of expected future short-term rates 
following some positive data for the European econ-
omy. 

The nominal Treasury yield curve steepened appreciably, 
on net, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields ending the inter-
meeting period about 15 to 35 basis points higher.  Most 
of the increase in nominal yields was attributable to a rise 
in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation 
were relatively stable. 

Various measures typically used to assess liquidity in 
Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets 
were little changed over the intermeeting period; they 
have generally pointed to relatively stable market func-
tioning over the past several years.  However, the major-
ity of respondents to the June Senior Credit Officer 
Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms indicated 
that, over the past five years, liquidity and functioning in 
these markets, especially in Treasury markets, have dete-
riorated.  Respondents attributed the deterioration pri-
marily to securities dealers’ decreased willingness to pro-
vide balance sheet resources for market making as a re-
sult of both regulatory changes and changes in internal 
risk-management practices. 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



On balance, the expected path of the federal funds rate 
implied by futures contracts steepened noticeably be-
yond 2015, with a portion of this shift coming after the 
May employment report.  Some evidence suggested that 
a significant part of the increase may have reflected 
higher term premiums.  By contrast, Federal Reserve 
communications following the April FOMC meeting 
were characterized by investors as generally in line with 
expectations and elicited limited market reaction. 

Results from the June Survey of Primary Dealers and the 
June Survey of Market Participants indicated little 
change since the April survey in modal forecasts of the 
federal funds rate through 2018.  Respondents again saw 
the September 2015 FOMC meeting as the most likely 
time for the first increase in the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate.  The expected pace of tightening after 
the initial increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate, whenever that might occur, was similar to 
that reported in the April survey. 

Over the intermeeting period, most broad U.S. equity 
price indexes moved down a bit, on net, amid mixed 
macroeconomic news and little information on earnings.  
Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index over the 
next month increased, on balance, but remained near the 
lower end of its historical range.  Spreads on 10-year    
triple-B-rated corporate bonds over comparable- 
maturity Treasury securities widened somewhat, on net, 
while spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds nar-
rowed slightly. 

Financing conditions for large nonfinancial businesses 
continued to be accommodative.  Gross corporate bond 
issuance remained quite strong, and institutional lever-
aged loan issuance picked up significantly.  Commercial 
and industrial loans on banks’ balance sheets continued 
to increase at a solid pace.  Meanwhile, financing condi-
tions for small businesses continued to improve, though 
the growth of small business loans on banks’ books re-
mained subdued, partly reflecting still-tepid demand for 
credit from owners of small businesses. 

Financing for commercial real estate remained broadly 
available, although the expansion of commercial real es-
tate loans on banks’ books slowed in April and May, re-
portedly because of sales of loans secured by nonfarm 
nonresidential properties into pools of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities.  Measures of residential 
mortgage credit availability continued to improve grad-
ually over the intermeeting period.  Nevertheless, credit 
remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores.  
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased 
about 30 basis points, broadly in line with MBS yields 

and other longer-term rates.  Financing conditions in 
consumer credit markets stayed accommodative in 
March and April.  Auto and student loans expanded at a 
robust pace through April, while revolving credit picked 
up in March and April after a slow start at the beginning 
of the year. 

Sovereign bond yields in foreign economies rose notably 
during the intermeeting period, especially in the ad-
vanced economies, led by a substantial increase in Ger-
man bund yields.  A number of factors may have con-
tributed to the increase in yields, including a reappraisal 
of term premiums, which appeared to have fallen to very 
low levels in April.  The rise in yields was also supported 
by the release of some stronger-than-expected inflation 
data in the euro area and by European Central Bank 
communications that volatility in yields was to be ex-
pected.  Against this backdrop and with a step-up in con-
cerns about developments in Greece, equity prices de-
clined in most countries.  Stock prices in Japan and es-
pecially in China were the main exceptions.  The foreign 
exchange value of the dollar increased a bit, on balance, 
during the intermeeting period against the currencies of 
major U.S. trading partners.  While the dollar declined 
against the euro and other European currencies, it rose 
against the Canadian dollar, the yen, and many emerging 
market currencies, boosted in part by the strong U.S. 
employment report for May. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second 
half of this year was expected to step up from its pace in 
the first half.  However, economic growth in the second 
half was projected to be a little lower than in the projec-
tion prepared for the April meeting, largely reflecting a 
small downward revision to the forecast for household 
spending.  The staff’s medium-term projection for real 
GDP growth was essentially unrevised from the previ-
ous forecast.  The staff continued to project that real 
GDP would expand at a faster pace than potential out-
put in 2016 and 2017, supported primarily by increases 
in consumer spending, even as the normalization of the 
stance of monetary policy was assumed to proceed.  The 
expansion in economic output over the medium term 
was anticipated to trim resource slack; the unemploy-
ment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff’s 
estimate of its longer-run natural rate. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was lit-
tle changed, and it was unrevised over the medium term.  
Energy prices and non-oil import prices were expected 
to begin steadily rising next year, but the staff projected 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 16–17, 2015 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



that inflation would continue to be below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent over 2016 and 
2017.  However, inflation was anticipated to reach 2 per-
cent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer 
run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s ob-
jective and slack in labor and product markets projected 
to have waned. 

The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its 
June projections for real GDP growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the 
past 20 years.  The risks to the forecasts for real GDP 
growth and inflation were seen as tilted a little to the 
downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither 
monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to 
help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks.  
At the same time, the staff saw the risks around its out-
look for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-
flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 
2015 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional 
on each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary 
policy.5  The longer-run projections represent each par-
ticipant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants viewed the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as indicating that 
economic activity was expanding moderately after little 
change in the first quarter of the year.  Early in 2015, a 
number of factors—including unfavorable weather in 
parts of the country and labor disputes at West Coast 
ports—temporarily held down real GDP; several analy-
ses also suggested that difficulties with seasonal adjust-
ment likely contributed to an underestimate of first-

                                                 
5 The incoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Phil-
adelphia assumed office after the June FOMC meeting, on 
July 1, and a new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas has yet to be selected.  Blake Prichard and Helen E. 
Holcomb, first vice presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Philadelphia and Dallas, respectively, submitted economic 
projections. 

quarter real GDP.  The unemployment rate was un-
changed over the period between the April and June 
meetings, but payroll employment posted solid gains, 
and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators sug-
gested that underutilization of labor resources dimin-
ished somewhat.  Although participants marked down 
their expectations for the rate of increase in real GDP 
over the first half of the year, their projections for eco-
nomic growth in the second half of 2015 and over 2016 
and 2017 were broadly similar to those prepared for the 
March meeting.  Under their respective assumptions 
about appropriate monetary policy, participants gener-
ally expected real GDP to expand at a rate sufficient to 
continue to move labor market conditions toward levels 
judged consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  
Inflation readings available since the April meeting con-
tinued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objec-
tive, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and 
continued decreases in prices of non-energy imports.  
However, energy prices appeared to have stabilized.  
Participants continued to project a gradual rise in infla-
tion toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor 
market improved further and the transitory effects of 
earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated. 

In discussing how to interpret the reported weakness in 
real GDP during the first quarter, participants consid-
ered alternative estimates of real economic activity based 
on various data-filtering models maintained by Board 
and Reserve Bank staff.  These models yielded a range 
of estimates, but, overall, they suggested that real activity 
in the first quarter was likely stronger than the then- 
current official estimate of real GDP.  Some participants 
indicated that the higher alternative estimates seemed 
more consistent with the increases in real gross domestic 
income and private domestic final purchases in the first 
quarter as well as the strength in employment and hours 
worked.  However, the alternative estimates left open the 
question of when and to what extent the seasonal adjust-
ment and other measurement issues associated with of-
ficial estimates of GDP in the first quarter might un-
wind.

While participants generally saw the risks to their projec-
tions of economic activity and the labor market as bal-
anced, they gave a number of reasons to be cautious in 
assessing the outlook.  Some pointed to the risk that the 
weaker-than-anticipated rise in economic activity over 
the first half of the year could reflect factors that might 
continue to restrain sales and production, and that eco-
nomic activity might not have sufficient momentum to 
sustain progress toward the Committee’s objectives.  In 
particular, they were concerned that consumers could re-
main cautious or that the drag on sectors affected by 
lower energy prices and the higher dollar could persist.  
Others, however, viewed the strength in the labor mar-
ket in recent months as potentially signaling a stronger-
than-expected bounceback in economic activity.  Several 
mentioned their uncertainty about whether Greece and 
its official creditors would reach an agreement and about 
the likely pace of economic growth abroad, particularly 
in China and other emerging market economies.  Other 
concerns were related to whether the apparent weakness 
in productivity growth recently would be reversed or 
continue.  On the one hand, a rebound in productivity 
growth in coming quarters might restrain hiring and slow 
the improvement in labor market conditions.  On the 
other hand, if productivity growth remained weak, the 
labor market might tighten more quickly and inflation 
might rise more rapidly than anticipated. 

At the time of the April meeting, the increase in con-
sumer spending was estimated to have been unexpect-
edly weak in the first quarter following strong gains in 
the second half of 2014.  The additional information that 
had become available since then, including more com-
plete estimates of outlays for services and revised data 
on retail sales, indicated that consumer spending was 
somewhat better than previously reported, rising at a 
moderate pace in the first quarter.  In addition, the 
strong rebound in motor vehicle sales and the solid gain 
in retail sales in May suggested that the pace of consumer 
spending was picking up in the current quarter.  Moreo-
ver, a number of fundamental factors determining con-
sumer spending remained positive, including the boost 
to real income from the earlier decline in energy prices, 
low interest rates, sustained moderate gains in wage and 
salary income, stronger household balance sheets, and  
the high levels of households’ confidence about the eco-
nomic outlook and about their income prospects.  Many 
participants anticipated that these factors would support 
a solid pace of consumer spending going forward.  How-
ever, others remained concerned that consumers had 
not increased their spending as much as expected in re-
sponse to the drop in energy prices, and that the rise in 

the saving rate since last fall may signal more cautious 
behavior among households that might last for some 
time. 

A number of participants noted that housing starts and 
permits rose considerably in recent months, and indica-
tors of sales activity turned more positive.  Nonetheless, 
home construction was still below the trend that would 
appear consistent with population growth, sales re-
mained at low levels, and credit availability was still rela-
tively tight. 

Reports on manufacturing in a number of regions of-
fered some signs that the sector was no longer weaken-
ing, with a couple of Districts’ diffusion indexes turning 
up.  Still, cutbacks in spending on drilling and mining 
equipment, slow demand for other business equipment, 
and the drag on exports from slow foreign demand and 
previous increases in the dollar continued to weigh on 
industrial production.  Motor vehicle production was 
highlighted as a bright spot.  In those Districts in which 
activity had been adversely affected by the drop in en-
ergy prices, drilling activity was either contracting less 
rapidly or was stabilizing.  Higher oil production could 
continue to hold down energy prices in the near term, 
but industry contacts anticipated some recovery in prices 
over the coming year, which should stem layoffs and 
cuts in capital spending in the energy sector.  Agricultural 
production in several Districts appeared likely to benefit 
from wet weather, but weak farm income continued to 
weigh on the sector.  Several participants reported that 
the services sector was a relative source of strength in 
their Districts.  In general, business contacts continued 
to express optimism about stronger sales and production 
in the second half of the year. 

In their discussion of labor market conditions, partici-
pants offered their views on recent developments and 
the progress that had occurred in reducing underutiliza-
tion of labor resources.  They generally agreed that labor 
market conditions had improved somewhat over the in-
termeeting period, variously citing solid increases in pay-
roll employment and job openings; low levels of unem-
ployment insurance claims; and, despite an unchanged 
unemployment rate, some further reduction in broader 
measures of underutilization, particularly among those 
not actively searching for jobs, but available and inter-
ested in work.  Several participants pointed to some fa-
vorable trends that had developed over a longer period, 
such as the flattening out of the labor force participation 
rate and a shift in the flow of workers into more stable 
and higher-skilled jobs.  A number of participants noted 
that the outlook for continued job gains was evident in

reports on hiring intentions from business contacts in 
their Districts who indicated that more firms planned 
additions to their payrolls over the coming year than a 
year earlier.  While the cumulative improvements in la-
bor market conditions over the past year had been sub-
stantial, most participants judged that further progress 
would be required to eliminate underutilization of labor 
resources; some of them anticipated that the utilization 
gap would close around the end of the year.  Several 
other participants indicated that, in their view, labor 
market slack had already been largely eliminated. 

The ongoing rise in labor demand appeared to have be-
gun to result in a firming of wage increases.  Recent read-
ings on the employment cost index, hourly compensa-
tion, and average hourly earnings of employees sug-
gested some acceleration in wages.  According to busi-
ness contacts in a number of Districts, many firms look-
ing for new workers said they had been raising wages 
selectively to attract them; some had also begun to raise 
wages more generally.  However, several participants 
pointed out that, even with the recent upturn, wage in-
creases remain subdued. 

Participants discussed how the incoming information re-
garding inflation influenced their expectations for reach-
ing the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective over the 
medium term.  Total PCE inflation continued to run be-
low the Committee’s objective.  However, participants 
noted that the apparent stabilization of crude oil prices 
and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would re-
duce the downward pressure on inflation from falling 
prices of energy and imported goods.  Core PCE price 
inflation, as measured on a 12-month change basis, had 
slowed slightly from an already low rate.  However, sev-
eral participants pointed out that the 3-month change in 
that index had firmed recently, signaling some improve-
ment in the inflation outlook.  In addition, some cited 
alternative measures of inflation, such as the trimmed 
mean and median consumer price indexes (CPIs) and 
the trimmed mean PCE, which continued to run at 
higher levels than overall PCE inflation.  Survey 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained 
stable, and market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation, while still low, were higher than earlier in the year.  
Nonetheless, a couple of participants continued to be 
concerned that the extended period of low inflation 
might persist and feed through to inflation expectations, 
citing estimates from various inflation forecasting mod-
els and the downtrend in the 10-year CPI projections in 
the Survey of Professional Forecasters.  Participants 
continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary 

policy, inflation would move up to or toward the Com-
mittee’s objective over the medium term.  Among the 
factors influencing the trajectories of their inflation fore-
casts were their outlooks for the pace of real activity, la-
bor market conditions and wage developments, and in-
flation expectations. 

In their discussion of financial market developments 
over the intermeeting period, several participants com-
mented on the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, which 
accompanied a steeper run-up in the 10-year German 
yield.  The sharp rise in German yields appeared to re-
flect a retracing of the earlier decline in German rates to 
unsustainably low levels.  It was noted that the increase 
in U.S. yields was not especially large in a historical con-
text and that volatility in U.S. fixed-income markets was 
still somewhat below pre-crisis levels.  However, many 
participants expressed concern that a failure of Greece 
and its official creditors to resolve their differences could 
result in disruptions in financial markets in the euro area, 
with possible spillover effects on the United States.  And 
some participants reiterated the importance of effective 
Committee communications in reducing the likelihood 
of an outsized financial market reaction around the time 
that policy normalization begins. 

During their discussion of economic conditions and 
monetary policy, participants commented on a number 
of considerations associated with the timing and pace of 
policy normalization.  Most participants judged that the 
conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved; 
a number of them cautioned against a premature deci-
sion.  Many participants emphasized that, in order to de-
termine that the criteria for beginning policy normaliza-
tion had been met, they would need additional infor-
mation indicating that economic growth was strengthen-
ing, that labor market conditions were continuing to im-
prove, and that inflation was moving back toward the 
Committee’s objective.  Other concerns that were men-
tioned were the potential erosion of the Committee’s 
credibility if inflation were to persist below 2 percent and 
the limited ability of monetary policy to offset downside 
shocks to inflation and economic activity when the fed-
eral funds rate was at its effective lower bound.  Some 
participants viewed the economic conditions for increas-
ing the target range for the federal funds rate as having 
been met or were confident that they would be met 
shortly.  They identified several possible risks associated 
with delaying the start of policy firming.  One such risk 
was the possibility that the Committee might need to 
tighten more rapidly than financial markets currently an-
ticipate—an outcome that could be associated with a sig-
nificant rise in longer-term interest rates or heightened

financial market volatility.  Another was that prolonging 
a high degree of monetary policy accommodation might 
result in an undesirable increase in inflation or might 
have adverse consequences for financial and macroeco-
nomic stability.  It was also pointed out that a prompt 
start to normalization would likely convey the Commit-
tee’s confidence in prospects for the economy.  During 
the discussion, a number of participants recommended 
that, around the time of the first increase in the target 
range, the Committee consider how it would update its 
communications regarding the likely path of the federal 
funds rate, with several indicating that the Committee 
should remain data dependent in making adjustments to 
the target range. 

Participants also discussed plans for publishing opera-
tional details regarding the implementation of monetary 
policy around the time of the first increase in the target 
range.  All participants supported a staff proposal for the 
Federal Reserve to issue an implementation note that 
would communicate separately from the Committee’s 
postmeeting policy statement the specific measures to be 
employed to implement the FOMC’s decision about the 
stance of policy.  Following scheduled FOMC meetings, 
this implementation note would be released at the same 
time as the Committee’s postmeeting statement; it would 
convey operational details regarding the settings of the 
policy tools and the changes in administered rates being 
employed to achieve the Committee’s desired stance of 
policy, and it would include the FOMC’s domestic policy 
directive to the Desk.  If adjustments to policy tools or 
administered rates subsequently proved necessary to im-
plement an unchanged policy stance, the implementa-
tion note could be revised without altering the Commit-
tee’s policy statement.  Participants agreed that this strat-
egy provided a number of advantages, including focus-
ing the Committee’s postmeeting statement on infor-
mation about economic conditions and the stance of 
monetary policy; communicating the details of policy-
makers’ operational decisions, including the FOMC’s 
domestic policy directive, in one place; reducing the risk 
that Federal Reserve communications regarding any 
technical adjustments to the operation of its policy tools 
after the commencement of policy firming might be mis-
taken as conveying information about the stance of pol-
icy; and emphasizing that operational decisions regard-
ing the Federal Reserve’s policy tools will be made in 
concert by the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC 
with the aim of maintaining the federal funds rate in the 
range established by the FOMC.  Participants also dis-
cussed how the language of the domestic policy directive 
could be revised when the first increase in the target 

range for the federal funds rate becomes appropriate.  It 
was noted that the Committee might, in addition to 
providing specific instructions to the Desk regarding op-
erations at that time, update other language in the di-
rective. 

Committee Policy Action 
In its discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, 
the Committee agreed that the weakness in the first 
quarter was at least in part the result of transitory factors, 
and members anticipated that economic growth would 
resume in the second quarter.  Although they expressed 
some uncertainty about the extent of the likely near-term 
pickup, members expected moderate economic growth 
over the medium term.  Labor market conditions had 
improved somewhat further, and members anticipated 
further progress in coming months.  Ongoing gains in 
employment and wages along with a high level of con-
sumer confidence were expected to provide support to 
household spending.  Signs of stronger housing activity 
were encouraging.  However, the outlook for business 
investment remained soft, and net exports were likely to 
continue to be restrained by the earlier appreciation of 
the dollar.  Inflation had been well below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective, but, with oil prices and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar stabilizing, mem-
bers expected that inflation would gradually rise toward 
2 percent over the medium term.  Members thus saw 
economic conditions as continuing to approach those 
consistent with warranting a start to the normalization 
of the stance of monetary policy.  In these circum-
stances, members agreed to continue making decisions 
about the appropriate target range for the federal funds 
rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis, with their decisions 
depending on the implications of economic and financial 
developments for the prospects for labor markets and 
inflation. 

With respect to its objective of maximum employment, 
the Committee judged that, on balance, a range of labor 
market indicators suggested that underutilization of la-
bor resources had diminished somewhat over the inter-
meeting period.  Most members saw room for additional 
progress in reducing labor market slack, while a couple 
of members indicated that they viewed the unemploy-
ment rate as very close or essentially identical to its  
mandate-consistent level.  Many expected that labor 
market underutilization would be largely eliminated 
around year-end if economic activity strengthened as 
they expected.  However, some members were more un-
certain about the extent of progress in the labor market 
to date or were concerned that if the pace of economic 
growth remained slow, labor market conditions might

improve only gradually.  Most agreed that they would 
need more information on developments in the labor 
market to establish a solid basis for assessing whether 
labor market conditions had improved sufficiently to in-
itiate tightening. 

Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  Most members agreed that the re-
cent stability in crude oil prices had increased their con-
fidence that the downward pressure on inflation from 
earlier declines in energy prices was abating, and some 
noted the recent stability of the foreign exchange value 
of the dollar, which could eventually stem the decline in 
prices of imports.  Market-based measures of inflation 
compensation remained low, but they had risen some 
from their levels earlier in the year, and survey measures 
of inflation expectations continued to be stable.  How-
ever, core inflation was still well below 2 percent.  The 
Committee agreed to continue to monitor inflation de-
velopments closely.  In considering the Committee’s cri-
teria for beginning policy normalization, all members 
but one indicated that they would need to see more evi-
dence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and 
labor market conditions had firmed enough to return in-
flation to the Committee’s longer-run objective over the 
medium term; one member was already reasonably con-
fident of such an outcome. 

The Committee concluded that, although it had seen 
some progress, the conditions warranting an increase in 
the target range for the federal funds rate had not yet 
been met, and that additional information on the out-
look, particularly for labor markets and inflation, would 
be necessary before deciding to implement such an in-
crease.  One member, however, indicated a readiness to 
take that step at this meeting but also expressed a will-
ingness to wait another meeting or two for additional 
data before raising the target range. 

In considering how to communicate the rationale for the 
Committee’s policy decision, members discussed the im-
portance of adjusting the language in the postmeeting 
statement to acknowledge the evolution of progress to-
ward the Committee’s objectives.  The Committee 
judged it appropriate to communicate that it had seen 
some further improvement in labor market conditions 
over the intermeeting period, stating that a range of la-
bor market indicators suggested that underutilization of 
labor resources diminished somewhat.  It also decided 
to indicate the likelihood that energy prices might soon 
exert less downward influence on inflation, saying that 
energy prices appeared to have stabilized, and to restate 
its expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 

2 percent over the medium term as the labor market im-
proves further and the transitory effects of earlier de-
clines in energy and import prices dissipate.  

The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm 
in the statement that the Committee’s decision about 
how long to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of ac-
tual and expected progress toward its objectives of max-
imum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Members 
continued to judge that their evaluation of progress on 
their objectives would take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor market condi-
tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments.  Members agreed to retain the indication 
that the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate 
to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when 
it has seen further improvement in the labor market and 
is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 
its 2 percent objective over the medium term. 

The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from agency debt and agency mort-
gage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s hold-
ings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should 
help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  The 
Committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even 
after employment and inflation are near mandate- 
consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some 
time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 
¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk 
to undertake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain such conditions.  The 
Committee directs the Desk to maintain its 
policy of rolling over maturing Treasury

securities into new issues and its policy of 
reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities 
in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in 
dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the 
Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.  The System Open 
Market Account manager and the secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 
sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in April suggests that 
economic activity has been expanding moder-
ately after having changed little during the first 
quarter.  The pace of job gains picked up while 
the unemployment rate remained steady.  On 
balance, a range of labor market indicators 
suggests that underutilization of labor re-
sources diminished somewhat.  Growth in 
household spending has been moderate and 
the housing sector has shown some improve-
ment; however, business fixed investment and 
net exports stayed soft.  Inflation continued 
to run below the Committee’s longer-run ob-
jective, partly reflecting earlier declines in en-
ergy prices and decreasing prices of non- 
energy imports; energy prices appear to have 
stabilized.  Market-based measures of infla-
tion compensation remain low; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  The Committee ex-
pects that, with appropriate policy accommo-
dation, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace, with labor market indicators 
continuing to move toward levels the Com-
mittee judges consistent with its dual man-
date.  The Committee continues to see the 
risks to the outlook for economic activity and 
the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation 
is anticipated to remain near its recent low 

level in the near term, but the Committee ex-
pects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 per-
cent over the medium term as the labor mar-
ket improves further and the transitory effects 
of earlier declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate.  The Committee continues to mon-
itor inflation developments closely. 

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that the 
current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In de-
termining how long to maintain this target 
range, the Committee will assess progress—
both realized and expected—toward its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indica-
tors of inflation pressures and inflation expec-
tations, and readings on financial and interna-
tional developments.  The Committee antici-
pates that it will be appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate when it 
has seen further improvement in the labor 
market and is reasonably confident that infla-
tion will move back to its 2 percent objective 
over the medium term. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treas-
ury securities at auction.  This policy, by keep-
ing the Committee’s holdings of longer-term 
securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

When the Committee decides to begin to re-
move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-
anced approach consistent with its longer-run 
goals of maximum employment and inflation 
of 2 percent.  The Committee currently antic-
ipates that, even after employment and infla-
tion are near mandate-consistent levels, eco-
nomic conditions may, for some time, warrant 
keeping the target federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run.”

Summary of Economic Projections
 
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 16–17, 2015, meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each 
year from 2015 to 2017 and over the longer run.1 Each 
participant’s projection was based on information avail-
able at the time of the meeting together with his or her 
assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assump-
tions about the factors likely to affect economic out-
comes.  The longer-run projections represent each par-
ticipant’s assessment of the value to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” 
is defined as the future path of policy that each partici-
pant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic 
activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual 
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of 
maximum employment and stable prices.  

________________ 
1 The incoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Phil-
adelphia assumed office after the June FOMC meeting, on 
July 1, and a new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas has yet to be selected.  Blake Prichard and Helen E. 
Holcomb, first vice presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Philadelphia and Dallas, respectively, submitted economic 
projections. 

FOMC participants generally expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, growth of real gross domestic 
product (GDP) in 2015 would be somewhat below their 
individual estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer-run 
normal growth rate but would increase in 2016 before 
slowing to or toward its longer-run rate in 2017 (table 1 
and figure 1).   Participants generally expected that the 
unemployment rate would continue to decline in 2015 
and 2016, and that the unemployment rate would be at 
or below their individual judgments of its longer-run 
normal level by the end of 2017.  Participants anticipated 
that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), would be appreciably below 2 percent 
this year but expected it to step up next year, and a sub-
stantial majority of participants projected that inflation 
would be at or close to the Committee’s goal of 2 per-
cent in 2017.  

As shown in figure 2, all but two participants anticipated 
that further improvement in economic conditions and 
the economic outlook would make it appropriate to 
begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate 
in 2015.  The economic outlooks of individual partici-
pants implied that it likely would be appropriate to raise 
the target federal funds rate fairly gradually over the pro-
jection period in order to promote labor market condi-
tions and inflation the Committee judges most con-

    NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian 
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  
Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee 
on March 17–18, 2015.

to 1/4 percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In March 2015, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged
that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015 and 2016 were, respectively, 15 and 2. In
the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1/8 percentage point) of an individual
participant’s judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate
target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

sistent with attaining its mandated objectives of maxi-
mum employment and stable prices.  Most participants 
continued to expect that it would be appropriate for the 
federal funds rate to stay appreciably below its longer-
run level for some time after inflation and unemploy-
ment are near mandate-consistent levels, reflecting the 
effects of remaining headwinds holding back the eco-
nomic expansion, and other factors. 

Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with 
their outlooks for economic growth and the unemploy-
ment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the 
past 20 years.  Most participants also judged the level of 
uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the 
average level of the past 20 years, although some partic-
ipants viewed it as higher.  In addition, most participants 
continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly bal-
anced, though some viewed the risks to economic 
growth as weighted to the downside.  A majority of par-
ticipants saw the risks to inflation as balanced; of the five 
who did not see inflation risks as balanced, four saw risks 
as tilted to the downside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
Participants generally projected that, conditional on their 
individual assumptions about appropriate monetary pol-
icy, real GDP would grow slowly in the first half of 2015, 
but that this near-term weakness would give way to 
growth in 2016 that exceeds their estimates of its longer-
run normal rate; most participants expected real GDP 
growth to slow in 2017 to rates at or near their individual 
estimates of the longer-run rate.  Participants generally 
regarded the weakness in economic activity in the first 
half of this year to be temporary and pointed to a num-
ber of factors that they expected would contribute to 
solid output growth through 2016, including improving 
labor market conditions, strengthened household and 
business balance sheets, waning effects of the earlier in-
creases in the exchange value of the dollar, a boost to 
consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing 
restraint from fiscal policy, and still-accommodative 
monetary policy. 

Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) contributions in March, all participants revised 
down their projections of real GDP growth for 2015, 
but many expected the economy to make up at least 
some of the shortfall over the remainder of the forecast 
period.  Beyond the near term, changes in participants’ 
forecasts were small.  The central tendencies of partici-
pants’ current projections for real GDP growth were 
1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2015, 2.4 to 2.7 percent in 2016, and 

2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2017.  The central tendency of the 
projections of GDP growth in the longer run was un-
changed from March at 2.0 to 2.3 percent. 

Most participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would continue to decline through 2016, and nearly all 
projected that by the fourth quarter of 2017, the unem-
ployment rate would be at or below their individual judg-
ments of its longer-run normal level.  The central 
tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemploy-
ment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.2 to 
5.3 percent in 2015, and 4.9 to 5.1 percent in both 2016 
and 2017.  Compared with the March SEP, participants’ 
projections for the unemployment rate edged up in 2015 
but were little different over the medium term.  Several 
participants indicated that the differences from their 
March projections for the unemployment rate over the 
medium term were modest in part because of the mon-
etary policy response that they incorporated into their 
forecasts to mitigate an otherwise weaker trajectory for 
expenditures. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of partici-
pants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate through 2017 and in 
the longer run.  Some of the diversity of views reflected 
participants’ individual assessments of a number of fac-
tors, including the effects of lower oil prices on con-
sumer spending and business investment, the extent to 
which dollar appreciation would affect real activity, the 
rate at which the forces that have been restraining the 
pace of the economic recovery would continue to abate, 
the trajectory for growth in consumption as labor mar-
ket slack diminishes, and the appropriate path of mone-
tary policy.  Relative to the March SEP, the dispersion 
of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2015 
narrowed considerably, reflecting in part the release of 
the national income and product accounts data for the 
first quarter of this year, which were not available when 
the FOMC met in March. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
All participants projected headline PCE inflation to 
come in at or below 1 percent this year—mostly due to 
the temporary effects of earlier declines in energy prices 
and decreases in non-energy import prices—but to 
climb to 1½ percent or more in 2016.  A sizable majority 
of participants expected that headline inflation would be 
at or close to the Committee’s goal in 2017.  Most par-
ticipants projected only a slight decline in core PCE in-
flation this year and anticipated a gradual rise over the 
remainder of the forecast period.  Relative to the March 
SEP, participants’ projections for PCE inflation changed

very little.  The central tendencies for PCE inflation were 
0.6 to 0.8 percent in 2015, 1.6 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 
1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017; for core PCE inflation, the 
central tendencies were 1.3 to 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.6 to 
1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017.  Fac-
tors cited by participants as likely to contribute to infla-
tion rising toward 2 percent included stable longer-term 
inflation expectations, steadily diminishing resource 
slack, a pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of de-
clines in energy prices, and still-accommodative mone-
tary policy.   

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The range of projections for PCE inflation in 2015 
narrowed, albeit mostly on the basis of the lowering of 
just one projection; otherwise, the ranges of participants’ 
projections for both headline and core PCE inflation 
were nearly identical to what was reported in March.   

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Participants judged that it would be appropriate to begin 
normalization of monetary policy as labor market indi-
cators and inflation moved to or toward values the Com-
mittee regards as consistent with the attainment of its 
mandated objectives of maximum employment and 
price stability.  As shown in figure 2, all but two partici-
pants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin 
raising the target range for the federal funds rate during 
2015.  However, a sizable majority projected that the ap-
propriate level of the federal funds rate would remain 
below their individual estimates of its longer-run normal 
level through 2017. 

All but a few participants projected that the unemploy-
ment rate would be at or somewhat above their estimates 
of its longer-run normal level at the end of the year in 
which they judged the initial increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate would be warranted, and all 
participants projected that unemployment would decline 
further after the commencement of normalization.  All 
participants projected that inflation would be below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective that year, but they also 
saw inflation rising notably closer to 2 percent in the fol-
lowing year. 

Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2015 to 2017 and over the longer run.  Relative to their 
March projections, most participants considered a lower 
level of the federal funds rate to be appropriate over 
some part of the projection period.  The median projec-
tion for the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 was 

unchanged from March at 0.63 percent; however, the 
mean federal funds rate projection of 0.58 percent for 
that date was 19 basis points lower than in March.  The 
median projections for the ends of 2016 and 2017 were 
1.63 percent and 2.88 percent, respectively—both 25 ba-
sis points lower than in March.    Compared with the 
March SEP, the dispersion of the projections for the ap-
propriate level of the federal funds rate was a bit nar-
rower over 2015 and 2016, and about the same as in 
March for 2017. 

A sizable majority of participants judged that it would be 
appropriate for the federal funds rate at the end of 2017 
to remain below its longer-run normal level, with about 
half of all participants projecting the federal funds rate 
at that time to be more than ½ percentage point lower 
than their estimates of its longer-run value.  Participants 
provided a number of reasons why they thought it would 
be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain below 
its longer-run normal level for some time after inflation 
and the unemployment rate were near mandate- 
consistent levels.  These reasons included the expecta-
tion that headwinds that have been holding back the re-
covery would continue to exert some restraint on eco-
nomic activity, that weak real activity abroad and the re-
cent appreciation of the dollar were likely to persist and 
temper spending and production in the United States, 
that residual slack in the labor market would still be evi-
dent in some measures of labor utilization other than the 
unemployment rate, and that the risks to the economic 
outlook were asymmetric in part because of the con-
straints on monetary policy associated with the effective 
lower bound on the federal funds rate. 

Relative to the March SEP, participants made at most 
modest adjustments to their estimates of the longer-run 
level of the federal funds rate.  These changes left the 
median estimate of the longer-run normal federal funds 
rate unchanged from March at 3.75 percent; the central 
tendency for the federal funds rate in the longer run was 
3.5 to 3.75 percent, also the same as in March. 

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary 
policy were informed by their judgments about the state 
of the economy, including their estimates of the values 
of the unemployment rate and other labor market indi-
cators that would be consistent with maximum employ-
ment, the extent to which labor market conditions were 
currently perceived to be falling short of maximum em-
ployment, and the prospects for inflation to return to the 
Committee’s longer-term objective of 2 percent over the 
medium term.  Also noted by participants were the im-
plications of international developments for the domes-

GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly 
similar to the norms of the previous 20 years (figure 4).2  
As in March, most participants saw the risks to their out-
looks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, al-
though some participants again viewed the risks to real 
GDP growth as weighted to the downside.  Those par-
ticipants who viewed the risks as weighted to the down-
side cited, for example, concern about the limited ability 
of monetary policy to respond to negative shocks to the 
economy when the federal funds rate is at its effective 
lower bound, a fragile foreign economic outlook, and 
weak readings on productivity growth.  A large majority 
of participants judged the risks to the outlook for the 
unemployment rate to be broadly balanced. 

Participants generally agreed that the levels of uncer-
tainty associated with their inflation forecasts were 
broadly similar to historical norms.  A few policymakers 
indicated that their confidence in the likelihood of infla-
tion moving toward the policy objective of 2 percent in-
flation had increased.  In all, 11 participants viewed the 
risks to their inflation forecast as balanced, up from 8 in 
the March SEP.  The risks were still seen as tilted to the 
downside by 5 participants who cited the possibility that 
the effects of the high exchange value of the dollar on 
domestic inflation could persist for longer than antici-
pated, that longer-term inflation expectations might co-
alesce on a lower level of inflation than assumed, or that, 
in current circumstances, it could be difficult for the 
Committee to respond effectively to low-inflation out-
comes.  Conversely, 1 participant saw risks to inflation 
as weighted to the upside, citing uncertainty about the 
timing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of 
monetary policy accommodation.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the 
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform 
discussions of monetary policy among policy-
makers and can aid public understanding of the 
basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-
tainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relation-
ships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the 
real world, and the future path of the economy 
can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-
ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely eco-
nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-
tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-
ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they oc-
cur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-
tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate 
the considerable uncertainty associated with 
economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively,        
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that ex-
perienced in the past and the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported in table 2 would imply a probability of 
about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-
pand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the 

current year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second 
year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year.  The 
corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals 
for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent 
in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the 
second and third years. 

Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, 
participants provide judgments as to whether 
the uncertainty attached to their projections of 
each variable is greater than, smaller than, or 
broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-
certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-
ipants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the up-
side, are weighted to the downside, or are 
broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge 
whether each variable is more likely to be above 
or below their projections of the most likely out-
come.  These judgments about the uncertainty 
and the risks attending each participant’s projec-
tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-
pants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks 
associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of differ-
ent projections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-
certainty arises primarily because each partici-
pant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  
If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected 
manner, then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change 
from that point forward.
