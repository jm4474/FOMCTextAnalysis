Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) discussed U.S. and global financial develop-
ments.  In global markets, strains in emerging market 
economies (EMEs) contributed to volatility in currency 
and equity markets over the period.  In addition, con-
cerns about trade tensions between the United States 
and China were the focus of a great deal of attention 
among market participants.  Such concerns led the 
Shanghai Composite index to drop as much as 8 percent 
at one point over the intermeeting period before recov-
ering somewhat.  The renminbi, however, was relatively 
stable, reportedly in part because investors believed that 
Chinese authorities were prepared to take measures to 
counter significant renminbi depreciation. 

Regarding domestic financial markets, the manager 
noted that U.S. equity markets had posted strong gains, 
spurred by optimism regarding the U.S. economic out-
look and rising corporate earnings.  Longer-term Treas-
ury yields moved higher, and market-based measures of 
the expected path of the funds rate edged up.  According 
to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers 
and Survey of Market Participants, a 25 basis point in-
crease in the target range for the federal funds rate at the 
September meeting was widely expected; moreover, in-
vestors appeared to be placing high odds on a further 
quarter-point policy firming at the December meeting. 
In U.S. money markets, the spread between the three-
month London interbank offered rate and three-month 
overnight index swap (OIS) rates continued to narrow. 
The widening in that spread earlier in the year appeared 
to reflect an especially rapid run-up in Treasury bill sup-
ply.  Treasury bill supply remained elevated and report-
edly continued to contribute to upward pressure on 
overnight repurchase agreement (repo) rates.  The rela-
tively high level of repo rates was associated with con-
tinued very modest take-up in the Federal Reserve’s 
overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) op-
erations.  Elevated repo rates may also have contributed 
to the relatively tight spread between the interest on ex-
cess reserves (IOER) rate and the effective federal funds 
rate.  That spread stood at 3 basis points over much of 
the period and seemed likely to narrow to 2 basis points 
in the near future.  As yet, there were no signs that the 
upward pressure on the federal funds rate relative to the 
IOER rate was due to scarcity of aggregate reserves in 
the banking system.  The level of reserves in the banking 
system temporarily dipped sharply in mid-September in 
connection with a sizable inflow of tax receipts to the

Treasury’s account at the Federal Reserve; however, that 
reduction in reserves in the banking system did not seem 
to have any effect on the federal funds market or the 
effective federal funds rate. 

In reviewing Federal Reserve operations, the manager 
noted that market reaction to the ongoing reduction in 
the System’s holdings of Treasury and agency securities 
had been muted to date.  With the increase in the caps 
on redemptions to be implemented beginning in Octo-
ber, reinvestment of Treasury securities would occur al-
most exclusively in the middle month of each quarter in 
connection with the Treasury’s midquarter refunding 
auctions.  Under the baseline path for interest rates, the 
Federal Reserve’s reinvestments of principal payments 
on agency mortgage-backed securities would likely fall to 
zero beginning in October; however, prepayments could 
rise somewhat above the redemption cap in some 
months in the future given the uncertainties surrounding 
prepayment projections. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the September 25–26 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin-
ued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross 
domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a 
strong rate in the third quarter, similar to its pace in the 
first half of the year.  The flooding and damage from 
Hurricane Florence, which made landfall on Septem-
ber 14, seemed likely to have a modest, transitory effect 
on national economic growth in the second half of the 
year.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 
12-month percentage change in the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained near
2 percent in July.  Survey-based measures of longer-run
inflation expectations were little changed on balance.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a strong 
pace, on average, in July and August.  The national un-
employment rate decreased to 3.9 percent in July and re-
mained at that level in August, while the labor force par-
ticipation rate and the employment-to-population ratio 
moved down somewhat, on balance, over those two 
months.  The unemployment rates for African Ameri-
cans, Asians, and Hispanics in August were below their 
levels at the end of the previous expansion.  The share 
of workers employed part time for economic reasons de-
clined further to below its level in late 2007.  The rate of 

private-sector job openings continued to be elevated in 
June and July, while the rate of quits moved higher on 
balance; initial claims for unemployment insurance ben-
efits were at a historically low level in mid-September.  
Total labor compensation per hour in the nonfarm busi-
ness sector increased 3.3 percent over the four quarters 
ending in the second quarter, and average hourly earn-
ings for all employees rose 2.9 percent over the 
12 months ending in August. 

Industrial production expanded at a solid pace in July 
and August.  Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested 
that light motor vehicle production would be roughly 
flat in the fourth quarter, although broader indicators of 
manufacturing production, such as the new orders in-
dexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, 
pointed to further solid gains in factory output in the 
near term. 

Real PCE appeared to be rising strongly in the third 
quarter.  Retail sales increased somewhat in August, and 
the data for July were revised up to show a sizable gain. 
However, the rate of light motor vehicle sales moved 
down in July and August from the robust pace in the 
second quarter.  The staff’s preliminary assessment was 
that the consequences of Hurricane Florence would 
have a slight negative effect on aggregate real PCE 
growth in the third quarter but that spending would 
bounce back in the fourth quarter.  More broadly, recent 
readings on key factors that influence consumer spend-
ing—including gains in employment, real disposable 
personal income, and households’ net worth—contin-
ued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the 
near term.  Moreover, consumer sentiment, as measured 
by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, 
remained upbeat in August and early September. 

Real residential investment looked to be declining fur-
ther in the third quarter.  Starts for new single-family 
homes and multifamily units were, on average, below 
their second-quarter rates in July and August.  The issu-
ance of building permits for both types of housing 
stepped down, on net, over those two months, which 
suggested that starts might move lower in coming 
months.  Sales of both new and existing homes declined 
somewhat in July, and existing home sales were flat in 
August. 

Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property appeared to be moderat-
ing a little in the third quarter following strong gains in 
expenditures in the first half of the year.  Nominal ship-
ments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft 
rose briskly in July, although spending for transportation

equipment investment moved down in recent months.  
Forward-looking indicators of business equipment 
spending—such as increases in new and unfilled capital 
goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business 
sentiment from national and regional surveys—pointed 
to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term.  
Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc-
tures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined 
in July, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs 
in operation—an indicator of business spending for 
structures in the drilling and mining sector—held about 
steady in recent weeks. 

Total real government purchases looked to be rising fur-
ther in the third quarter.  Nominal defense spending in 
July and August was consistent with continued increases 
in real federal purchases.  Real expenditures by state and 
local governments appeared to be roughly flat, as state 
and local government payrolls decreased slightly in July 
and August, while nominal construction spending by 
these governments rose modestly in July. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in 
June and July, with declining exports and rising imports.  
The decline in exports largely reflected lower exports of 
capital goods, while greater imports of industrial supplies 
boosted overall imports.  The available data suggested 
that the change in net exports would be a notable drag 
on real GDP growth in the third quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months 
ending in July.  Core PCE price inflation, which excludes 
changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 
2.0 percent over that same period.  The consumer price 
index (CPI) rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending 
in August, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent.  Re-
cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations—including those from the Michi-
gan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and 
the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of 
Market Participants—were little changed on balance. 

Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, 
as a pickup in growth for the advanced foreign econo-
mies (AFEs) was more than offset by slower growth in 
the EMEs.  Incoming indicators for the AFEs pointed 
to some moderation in the pace of growth in the third 
quarter, especially for Canada and Japan, while indica-
tors for the EMEs suggested a pickup in many countries 
from the unusually slow pace of the second quarter.  
Foreign inflation had risen a bit recently, boosted by 
higher oil prices and, in the EMEs, higher food prices 
and recent currency depreciation. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Nominal Treasury yields increased over the intermeeting 
period, as market reactions to domestic economic data 
releases that were, on balance, slightly stronger than ex-
pected appeared to outweigh ongoing concerns about 
trade policy and negative developments in some EMEs.  
FOMC communications over the period were largely in 
line with expectations and elicited little market reaction.  
Domestic stock prices rose, buoyed in part by positive 
news about corporate earnings, while foreign equity in-
dexes declined and the broad dollar index moved up.  Fi-
nancing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and 
households remained supportive of economic activity 
on balance. 

Global financial markets were volatile during the inter-
meeting period amid significant stress in some EMEs, 
ongoing focus on Brexit and on fiscal policy in Italy, and 
continued trade tensions.  On balance, the dollar was lit-
tle changed against AFE currencies and appreciated 
against EME currencies, as financial pressures on some 
EMEs weighed on broader risk sentiment.  Turkey and 
Argentina experienced significant stress, and other 
countries with similar macroeconomic vulnerabilities 
also came under pressure.  There were small outflows 
from dedicated emerging market funds, and EME sov-
ereign bond spreads widened.  Trade tensions weighed 
on foreign equity prices, as the United States continued 
its trade negotiations with Canada and placed additional 
tariffs on Chinese products. 

FOMC communications elicited limited price reactions 
in financial markets over the intermeeting period, and 
market-implied measures of monetary policy expecta-
tions were little changed.  The probability of an increase 
in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at 
the September FOMC meeting, as implied by quotes on 
the federal funds futures contracts, increased to near cer-
tainty.  The market-implied probability of an additional 
rate increase at the December FOMC meeting rose to 
about 75 percent.  The market-implied path for the fed-
eral funds rate beyond 2018 increased a touch. 

Evolving trade-related risks and other international de-
velopments reportedly weighed somewhat on market 
sentiment.  However, domestic economic data releases 
came in a bit above market expectations, on net, with the 
stronger-than-expected average hourly earnings in the 
August employment report notably boosting Treasury 
yields.  Nominal Treasury yields moved up over the in-
termeeting period, with the 10-year yield rising above 
3 percent.  Measures of inflation compensation derived 
from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities over the

next 5 years ticked up and were little changed 5 to 
10 years ahead. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 4 per-
cent since the August FOMC meeting, as positive news 
about corporate earnings and the domestic economy 
outweighed negative international developments.  Stock 
prices increased for many sectors in the S&P 500 index, 
as the second-quarter earnings reports for firms that re-
ported later in the earnings cycle came in strong.  How-
ever, concerns about economic prospects abroad—par-
ticularly with respect to trade policy and China—ap-
peared to weigh on stocks in the energy and basic mate-
rials sectors, which declined.  Option-implied volatility 
on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon—the 
VIX—moved down but remained somewhat above the 
extremely low levels seen in late 2017.  Spreads of invest-
ment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed a bit on 
net. 

Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly over 
the intermeeting period.  An elevated level of Treasury 
bills outstanding, following heavy issuance this summer, 
continued to put upward pressure on money market 
rates and reduced the attractiveness of the Federal Re-
serve’s ON RRP facility.  Take-up at the facility averaged 
$2.9 billion per day over the intermeeting period.  
Spreads of unsecured funding rates over comparable-
maturity OIS rates continued to retrace the rise in 
spreads recorded earlier this year. 

On balance, financing conditions for large nonfinancial 
firms remained accommodative in recent months.  De-
mand for corporate borrowing appeared to have de-
clined, in part because of strong earnings, rising interest 
rates, and seasonal factors.  In July and August, gross 
issuance of corporate bonds was relatively weak, while 
commercial and industrial loan growth moderated.  
Meanwhile, the pace of equity issuance was solid in July 
but fell in August, reflecting seasonal factors.  Financing 
conditions for small businesses remained favorable, and 
survey-based measures of credit demand among small 
business owners showed signs of strengthening, al-
though demand was still weak relative to pre-crisis levels.  
Gross issuance of municipal bonds continued to be 
solid. 

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions also remained accommodative.  Although 
CRE loan growth at banks moderated in July and Au-
gust, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) was robust.  CMBS spreads were little changed 

over the intermeeting period and stayed near their post-
crisis lows. 

Residential mortgage financing conditions remained ac-
commodative on balance.  For borrowers with low 
credit scores, however, conditions were still somewhat 
tight despite continued easing in credit availability.  Re-
financing activity continued to be muted in recent 
months, and the growth in purchase mortgage origina-
tions slowed a bit relative to year-earlier levels, in part 
reflecting the notable increase in mortgage rates earlier 
this year. 

On net, financing conditions in consumer credit markets 
were little changed in recent months and remained 
largely supportive of growth in household spending.  
However, the supply of credit to consumers with sub-
prime credit scores remained tight.  More broadly, al-
though interest rates for credit cards and auto loans con-
tinued to rise, consumer credit expanded at a solid pace. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared for the Septem-
ber FOMC meeting, real GDP was projected to increase 
in the second half of this year at a rate that was just a 
little slower than in the first half of the year.  The staff’s 
preliminary assessment was that the effects of Hurricane 
Florence would lead to a slight reduction in real GDP 
growth in the third quarter and a small addition to 
growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity re-
turned to more normal levels and some disrupted activ-
ity was made up.  Over the 2018–20 period, output was 
projected to rise at a rate above or at the staff’s estimate 
of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 
2021.  The unemployment rate was projected to decline 
further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natu-
ral rate but to bottom out in 2020 and begin to edge up 
in 2021.  Relative to the forecast prepared for the previ-
ous meeting, the projection for real GDP growth this 
year was revised up a little, primarily in response to 
stronger-than-expected incoming data on household 
spending and business investment.  The projection for 
the medium term was not materially changed, in part be-
cause the recently enacted tariffs on Chinese goods and 
the retaliatory actions of China were judged to have only 
a small net effect on U.S. real GDP growth over the next 
few years.  In addition, the staff continued to anticipate 
that supply constraints might restrain output growth 
somewhat in the medium term.  The unemployment rate 
was projected to be a little lower over the medium term 
than in the previous forecast, partly in response to the 
staff’s assessment that the natural rate of unemployment 
was a bit lower than previously assumed.  With labor 
market conditions already tight, the staff continued to

assume that projected employment gains would manifest 
in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unem-
ployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure 
on the labor force participation rate. 

The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 
was revised up slightly, mainly because of a faster-than-
expected increase in consumer energy prices in the sec-
ond half.  The staff continued to project that total PCE 
inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective over the medium term and that core PCE price 
inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation 
over that period because of a projected decline in con-
sumer energy prices in 2019 through 2021. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.  On the 
upside, household spending and business investment 
could expand faster than the staff projected, supported 
in part by the tax cuts enacted last year.  On the down-
side, trade policies and foreign economic developments 
could move in directions that have significant negative 
effects on U.S. economic growth.  Risks to the inflation 
projection also were seen as balanced.  The upside risk 
that inflation could increase more than expected in an 
economy that was projected to move further above its 
potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that 
longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than 
was assumed in the staff forecast. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections are described 
in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which 
is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received since the FOMC met in August indicated that 

the labor market continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity rose at a strong rate.  Job gains were 
strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate stayed low.  Recent data suggested that house-
hold spending and business fixed investment grew 
strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation 
and inflation for items other than food and energy re-
mained near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term infla-
tion expectations were little changed on balance. 

Meeting participants noted that a number of communi-
ties suffered devastating losses associated with Hurri-
cane Florence.  Despite the magnitude of the storm- 
related destruction, participants expected the imprint on 
the level of overall economic activity at the national level 
to be relatively modest, consistent with the experience 
following several previous major storms. 

Based on recent readings on spending, employment, and 
inflation, almost all participants saw little change in their 
assessment of the economic outlook, although a few of 
them judged that recent data pointed to a pace of eco-
nomic activity that was stronger than they had expected 
earlier this year.  Participants noted a number of favora-
ble economic factors that were supporting above-trend 
GDP growth; these included strong labor market condi-
tions, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, ac-
commodative financial conditions, solid household bal-
ance sheets, and continued high levels of household and 
business confidence.  A number of participants observed 
that the stimulative effects of the changes in fiscal policy 
would likely diminish over the next several years.  A cou-
ple of participants commented that recent strong growth 
in GDP may also be due in part to increases in the 
growth rate of the economy’s productive capacity.  

In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
generally characterized consumption growth as strong, 
and they judged that robust increases in disposable in-
come, high levels of consumer confidence, and solid 
household balance sheets had contributed to the 
strength in spending.  Several participants noted that the 
household saving rate had been revised up significantly 
in the most recent estimates published by the Bureau of 
Economic Activity.  A few of those participants re-
marked that the upward revision in the saving rate could 
be viewed as evidence of the strength of the financial 
position of the household sector and could be a factor 
that would further support solid expansion of consump-
tion spending.  However, a couple of participants noted 
that the higher saving rate may not be a precursor to 
higher future consumption growth.  For example, the 
higher saving rate may indicate some greater caution on 
the part of consumers, greater inequality of income and

wealth—which would imply a lower aggregate propen-
sity to spend—or changing consumer behavior in a low 
interest rate environment.  With regard to residential in-
vestment, a few participants noted weak residential con-
struction activity at the national or District level, which 
was attributed in part to higher interest rates or supply 
constraints. 

Participants noted that business fixed investment had 
grown strongly so far this year.  A few commented that 
recent changes in federal tax policy had likely bolstered 
investment spending.  Contacts in most sectors re-
mained optimistic about their business prospects, and 
surveys of manufacturing activity were broadly favora-
ble.  Despite this optimism, a number of contacts cited 
factors that were causing them to forego production or 
investment opportunities in some cases, including labor 
shortages and uncertainty regarding trade policy.  In par-
ticular, tariffs on aluminum and steel were cited as re-
ducing new investment in the energy sector.  Contacts 
also suggested that firms were attempting to diversify the 
set of countries with which they trade—both imports 
and exports—as a result of uncertainty over tariff policy.  
Contacts in the agricultural industry reported that tariffs 
imposed by China had resulted in lower crop prices, fur-
ther depressing incomes in that sector, although a new 
federal program was expected to offset some income 
losses.   

In their discussion of labor markets, participants gener-
ally agreed that conditions continued to strengthen.  
Contacts in many Districts reported tight labor markets, 
with difficulty finding qualified workers.  In some cases, 
firms were coping with labor shortages by increasing sal-
aries, benefits, or workplace amenities in order to attract 
and retain workers.  Other business contacts facing labor 
shortages were responding by increasing training for 
less-qualified workers.  For the economy overall, partic-
ipants generally agreed that, on balance, recent data sug-
gested some acceleration in labor costs, but that wage 
growth remained moderate by historical standards, 
which was due in part to tepid productivity growth. 

Regarding inflation, participants noted that on a  
12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for 
items other than food and energy remained near 2 per-
cent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 
were little changed on balance.  In general, participants 
viewed recent consumer price developments as con-
sistent with their expectation that inflation was on a tra-
jectory to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective on a sustained basis.  Several participants com-
mented that inflation may modestly exceed 2 percent for 
a period of time.  Reports from business contacts and 

surveys in a number of Districts also indicated some 
firming in inflationary pressures.  In particular, some 
contacts indicated that input prices had been bolstered 
by strong demand or import tariffs.  Moreover, several 
participants reported that firms in their Districts that 
were facing higher input prices because of tariffs per-
ceived that they had an increased ability to raise the 
prices of their products.  A couple of participants em-
phasized that because inflation had run below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent objective for the past several years, 
some measures of trend inflation or longer-term infla-
tion expectations were below levels consistent with the 
2 percent objective; these participants judged that a 
modest increase in inflation expectations would be im-
portant for achieving the inflation objective on a sus-
tained basis.   

In their discussion of developments in financial markets, 
a number of participants noted that financial conditions 
remained accommodative:  The rise in interest rates and 
appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period 
had been offset by increases in equity prices, and broader 
measures continued to point to accommodative financial 
conditions.  Some participants commented about the 
continued growth in leveraged loans, the loosening of 
terms and standards on these loans, or the growth of this 
activity in the nonbank sector as reasons to remain 
mindful of vulnerabilities and possible risks to financial 
stability. 

Participants commented on a number of risks and un-
certainties associated with their outlook for economic 
activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium 
term.  Participants generally agreed that risks to the out-
look appeared roughly balanced.  Some participants 
commented that trade policy developments remained a 
source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic 
growth and inflation.  The divergence between domestic 
and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary 
policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because 
of the potential for further strengthening of the U.S. dol-
lar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a 
few EMEs could pose additional risks if they were to 
spread more broadly through the global economy and 
financial markets.  With regard to upside risks, partici-
pants variously noted that high consumer confidence, 
accommodative financial conditions, or greater-than- 
expected effects of fiscal stimulus could lead to stronger-
than-expected economic outcomes.  Tightening re-
source utilization and an increasing ability of firms to 
raise output prices were cited as factors that could lead 
to higher-than-expected inflation, while lower-than- 
expected growth, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or

inflation expectations persistently running below 2 per-
cent were mentioned as risks that could lead to lower 
inflation. 

A few participants offered perspectives on the term 
structure of interest rates and what a potential inversion 
of the yield curve might signal about economic pro-
spects in light of the historical regularity that an inverted 
yield curve has often preceded the onset of recessions in 
the United States.  On the one hand, an inverted yield 
curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on 
the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent 
years—reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases—
could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve 
as an indicator of future economic activity.  In addition, 
the recent rise and possible further increases in longer-
term interest rates might diminish the likelihood that the 
yield curve would invert in the near term. 

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants generally judged that the economy was 
evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activ-
ity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions con-
tinuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s 
objective.  Based on their current assessments, all partic-
ipants expressed the view that it would be appropriate 
for the Committee to continue its gradual approach to 
policy firming by raising the target range for the federal 
funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Almost all 
considered that it was also appropriate to revise the 
Committee’s postmeeting statement in order to remove 
the language stating that “the stance of monetary policy 
remains accommodative.”  Participants discussed a 
number of reasons for removing the language at this 
time, noting that the Committee would not be signaling 
a change in the expected path for policy, particularly as 
the target range for the federal funds rate announced af-
ter the Committee’s meeting would still be below all of 
the estimates of its longer-run level submitted in the Sep-
tember SEP.  In addition, waiting until the target range 
for the federal funds rate had been increased further to 
remove the characterization of the policy stance as “ac-
commodative” could convey a false sense of precision in 
light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding all es-
timates of the neutral federal funds rate. 

With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting, participants generally anticipated that fur-
ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sus-
tained economic expansion, strong labor market condi-
tions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium 
term.  This gradual approach would balance the risk of 
tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead 

to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation mov-
ing below the Committee’s objective, against the risk of 
moving too slowly, which could engender inflation per-
sistently above the objective and possibly contribute to 
a buildup of financial imbalances. 

Participants offered their views about how much addi-
tional policy firming would likely be required for the 
Committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of max-
imum employment and 2 percent inflation.  A few par-
ticipants expected that policy would need to become 
modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that 
it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal 
funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level 
in order to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting 
of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective or the 
risk posed by significant financial imbalances.  A couple 
of participants indicated that they would not favor 
adopting a restrictive policy stance in the absence of 
clear signs of an overheating economy and rising infla-
tion. 

Participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for 
the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the 
evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out-
look relative to the Committee’s statutory objectives.  
Many of them noted that future adjustments to the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate will depend on the 
evaluation of incoming information and its implications 
for the economic outlook.  In this context, estimates of 
the level of the neutral federal funds rate would be only 
one among many factors that the Committee would con-
sider in making its policy decisions. 

Building on comments expressed at previous meetings, 
a couple of participants indicated that it would be desir-
able to assess the Committee’s strategic approach to the 
conduct of policy and to hold a periodic and systematic 
review of the strengths and weaknesses of the Commit-
tee’s monetary policy framework. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in August indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and that economic 
activity had been rising at a strong rate.  Job gains had 
been strong, on average, in recent months, and the un-
employment rate had stayed low.  Household spending 
and business fixed investment had grown strongly.  On 
a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for 
items other than food and energy remained near 2 per-
cent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 
were little changed on balance.

Members viewed the recent data as consistent with an 
economy that was evolving about as they had expected.  
Consequently, members expected that further gradual 
increases in the target range for the federal funds rate 
would be consistent with sustained expansion of eco-
nomic activity, strong labor market conditions, and in-
flation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive over the medium term.  Members continued to 
judge that the risks to the economic outlook remained 
roughly balanced. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate to 2 to 2¼ percent.  Members agreed that the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of 
realized and expected economic conditions relative to 
the Committee’s maximum-employment objective and 
symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  They reiterated 
that this assessment would take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and in-
flation expectations, and readings on financial and inter-
national developments. 

With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to remove the sentence indicating that “the 
stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.”  
Members made various points regarding the removal of 
the sentence from the statement.  These points included 
that the characterization of the stance of policy as “ac-
commodative” had provided useful forward guidance in 
the early stages of the policy normalization process, that 
this characterization was no longer providing meaning-
ful information in light of uncertainty surrounding the 
level of the neutral policy rate, that it was appropriate to 
remove the characterization of the stance from the 
Committee’s statement before the target range for the 
federal funds rate moved closer to the range of estimates 
of the neutral policy rate, and that the Committee’s ear-
lier communications had helped prepare the public for 
this change. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective September 27, 2018, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 

to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 2 to 2¼ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during Septem-
ber that exceeds $24 billion, and to continue re-
investing in agency mortgage-backed securities 
the amount of principal payments from the 
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities received 
during September that exceeds $16 billion.  Ef-
fective in October, the Committee directs the 
Desk to roll over at auction the amount of prin-
cipal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of Treasury securities maturing during each 
calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to 
reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities 
the amount of principal payments from the 
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities received 
during each calendar month that exceeds 
$20 billion.  Small deviations from these 
amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. 

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in August indicates that 
the labor market has continued to strengthen 
and that economic activity has been rising at a 
strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on av-
erage, in recent months, and the unemployment 
rate has stayed low.  Household spending and 
business fixed investment have grown strongly.  
On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and

inflation for items other than food and energy 
remain near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-
term inflation expectations are little changed, on 
balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that 
further gradual increases in the target range for 
the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective over the medium term.  Risks to the eco-
nomic outlook appear roughly balanced. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.” 

Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael 
Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Esther L. George, Loretta 
J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles.

                                                 
5 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab-
lish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Fed-
eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Rich-
mond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and 
San Francisco.  This vote also encompassed approval by the 
Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2.75 percent 
primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, 
effective on the later of September 27, 2018, and the date such 
Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Ms. George voted as alternate member at this meeting. 

To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances to 2.20 percent, effective 
September 27, 2018.  The Board of Governors also 
voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point in-
crease in the primary credit rate (discount rate) to 
2.75 percent, effective September 27, 2018.5  

Following the vote, Chairman Powell noted that he had 
asked Governor Clarida to serve as chair of a subcom-
mittee on communications issues.  The other members 
of the subcommittee will include Governor Brainard, 
President Kaplan, and President Rosengren.  The role of 
the subcommittee will be to help prioritize and frame 
communications issues for the Committee.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, Novem- 
ber 7–8, 2018.  The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on 
September 26, 2018. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on August 21, 2018, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 25–26, 2018, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.1  
Each participant’s projections were based on infor-
mation available at the time of the meeting, together with 
his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-
run value—and assumptions about other factors likely 
to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the 
value to which each variable would be expected to con-
verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and 
in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Ap-
propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos-
ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that 
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the 
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability. 

All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that, in 2018, real GDP would expand at a pace 
exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run 
growth rate of real GDP.  All participants anticipated 
that real GDP growth would moderate in the coming 
years, and a majority of participants projected growth in 
2021 to be below their estimates of the longer-run rate.  
All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that the unemployment rate would run below 
their estimates of its longer-run level throughout the 
projection period.  Participants generally projected that 
inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), would be at or near the Committee’s 
2 percent objective at the end of 2018 and would con-
tinue at close to that rate through 2021.  Compared with 
the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from 
June, a solid majority of participants marked up their 
projections of real GDP growth and most increased 
their forecast of the unemployment rate in 2018, with 

                                                 
1 Four members of the Board of Governors, one more than 
in June 2018, were in office at the time of the September 2018 
meeting and submitted economic projections.  The office of

participants indicating that these revisions mostly re-
flected incoming data.  Participants’ projections of infla-
tion were largely unchanged from June.  Table 1 and fig-
ure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, almost all participants continued 
to expect that the evolution of the economy, relative to 
their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation, would likely warrant further gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate.  The medians of participants’ 
projections of the federal funds rate through 2020 were 
unchanged relative to their June projections, and the me-
dian of participants’ projections for 2021 was the same 
as that for 2020.  The median projection for the longer-
run federal funds rate rose slightly, with several partici-
pants citing increases in model-based estimates of the 
longer-run real federal funds rate and strong economic 
data as reasons for the revision.  A substantial majority 
of participants expected that the year-end 2020 and 2021 
federal funds rate would be above their estimates of the 
longer-run rate. 

In general, participants continued to view the uncer-
tainty around their economic projections as broadly sim-
ilar to the average of the past 20 years.  Risks to their 
outlooks were viewed as balanced, although a couple 
more participants than in June saw risks to their inflation 
projections as weighted to the upside.   

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The medians of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess-
ments of appropriate monetary policy, were 3.1 percent 
for 2018, 2.5 percent for 2019, and 2.0 percent for 2020.  
For this SEP, participants also submitted projections for 
economic variables in 2021 for the first time.  Partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2021 were al-
most all below participants’ projections of growth in 
2020 and, for a majority of participants, below their 
longer-run projections of real GDP growth.  Some par-
ticipants cited the waning of fiscal stimulus, less accom-
modative monetary policy, or anticipated appreciation of 
the dollar as factors contributing to their forecasts for a 
moderation of real GDP growth over the course of the 
projection period.   

was vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; First Vice Pres-
ident Mark A. Gould submitted economic projections. 
2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate.

While most participants made slight upward revisions to 
their unemployment rate projections for this year, their 
projections in subsequent years and in the longer run 
were largely unchanged.  A substantial majority of par-
ticipants expected the unemployment rate to bottom out 
in 2019 or 2020 at levels below their estimates of the un-
employment rate in the longer run, and then to rise a 
little in 2021.    

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer 
run.  The distribution of individual projections for real 
GDP growth for this year shifted noticeably to the right 
relative to that in the June SEP; the distribution for pro-
jected real GDP growth for 2019 also shifted to the 
right, albeit only a little.  The distributions of individual 
projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 
shifted up a little relative to the distributions in June, 
while the distributions of the projections for the unem-
ployment rate in the longer run were largely unchanged.   

The Outlook for Inflation 
The medians of projections for total PCE price inflation 
were 2.1 percent in 2018, 2.0 percent in 2019, and 
2.1 percent in 2020 and 2021.  The medians of projec-
tions for core PCE price inflation were 2.0 percent in 
2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019, 2020, and 2021.  For the 
entire period between 2018 and 2020, these medians 
were very similar to the June SEP.  Figures 3.C and 3.D 
provide information on the distributions of participants’ 
views about the outlook for inflation.  Relative to the 
June SEP, a number of participants revised slightly down 
their projections for total PCE inflation this year and 
next.  Most participants projected total PCE price infla-
tion in the range of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2018 and 2019 
and 2.1 to 2.2 percent in 2020 and 2021.  Most partici-
pants projected that core PCE inflation would run at 
1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2018 and at 2.1 to 2.2 percent in 
2019, 2020, and 2021.  Relative to the June SEP, a larger 
number of participants projected that core PCE inflation 
in 2019 and 2020 would fall in the 2.1 to 2.2 percent 
range.     

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate for the end 
of each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.  
The distribution of projected policy rates for year-end 
2018 was higher than in the June SEP, with projections 
clustered around 2.4 percent.  The distributions of par-
ticipants’ views  of  the  appropriate federal funds rate at

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the 

root mean squared error of projections for 1998 through 2017 that 
were released in the fall by various private and government forecasters.  
As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assump-
tions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for 
real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate 
will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made 
in the past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter 
Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Us-
ing Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,”

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 

that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to 
fourth quarter basis. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury 
bills.  Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, 
in the fourth quarter. 

 

the ends of 2019 and 2020 were relatively wide, as was 
the case in the June SEP.   

In discussing their projections, almost all participants 
continued to express the view that the appropriate tra-
jectory of the federal funds rate would likely involve 
gradual increases.  This view was predicated on several 
factors, including a judgment that a gradual path of pol-
icy firming would appropriately balance the risk of a 
buildup of inflationary pressures or other imbalances as-
sociated with high levels of resource utilization, against 
the risk that factors such as diminishing fiscal stimulus 
and adverse developments in foreign economies could 
become a significant drag on real GDP growth.  As al-
ways, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate 
would depend on incoming economic data and their im-
plications for participants’ economic outlooks and as-
sessments of risks. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of 
possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those 
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of var-
ious private and government forecasts over the past

20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and total PCE price inflation.  Those measures are rep-
resented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts dis-
play the median SEP projections for the three variables 
surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived 
from the forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the de-
gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar 
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the 
risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then 
future outcomes of these variables would have about a 
70 percent probability of being within these confidence 
intervals.  For all three variables, this measure of uncer-
tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore-
cast horizon lengthens. 

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer-
tainty attached to their economic projections for real 
GDP growth and inflation as broadly similar to the av-
erage of the past 20 years.3  A couple more participants 
than in June viewed the uncertainty around the unem-
ployment rate as higher than average. 

Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec-
tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants assessed the 
risks to their projections of real GDP growth and the 
unemployment rate as broadly balanced—in other 
words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  

                                                 
3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur-
rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach 

Those participants who did not judge the risks to their 
real GDP growth and unemployment rate projections as 
balanced were roughly evenly split between those who 
viewed the risks as being weighted to the upside and 
those who viewed the risks as being weighted to the 
downside.  Risks around both total and core inflation 
projections were judged to be broadly balanced by a 
solid majority of participants; however, those partici-
pants who saw the risks as uneven saw them as weighted 
to the upside.   

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, many participants pointed to up-
side risks to real GDP growth from fiscal stimulus or 
stronger-than-expected effects of business optimism.  
Many participants also pointed to downside risks for the 
economy and inflation stemming from factors such as 
trade policy, stresses in emerging market economies, or 
stronger-than-anticipated appreciation of the dollar.   

Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate were also subject to considera-
ble uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the fed-
eral funds rate in response to actual and prospective de-
velopments over time in real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the 
projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re-
flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco-
nomic variables along with other factors.  Figure 5 pro-
vides a graphical representation of this uncertainty, plot-
ting the median SEP projection for the federal funds rate 
surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the re-
sults presented in table 2.  As with the macroeconomic 
variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the ap-
propriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and 
increases for longer horizons.

pants’ projections.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the members of 

the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.8 to 4.2 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 
4.8 percent in the second year, 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the third 
year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the 
third and fourth years.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate 
these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric 
and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projec-
tions for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion.  However, in some instances, the risks around the pro-
jections may not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemploy-
ment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around 
a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or 
the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart 
would be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro-
jection. 

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur- 

rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-
tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 

If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
