By unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the removal of the 

reference to the intermeeting federal funds range in the operational 

paragraph of the domestic policy directive.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was 

authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 

execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 

domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
a weakening in economic activity. Total nonfarm 
payroll employment declined further in October, 
reflecting sizable job losses in manufacturing and 
construction; the civilian unemployment rate held 
steady at 5.7 percent. Industrial production declined 
sharply in October after rising moderately during the 
summer. Consumer spending is estimated to have 
flattened out in real terms over August and September 
when a surge in energy prices caused a substantial 
drop in real disposable income. Advance indicators of 
business capital spending point to considerable 
softening in investment in coming months. Residential 
construction weakened further in the third quarter.



The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened 
substantially in July-August from its average rate in 
the second quarter as imports strengthened. Markedly 
higher oil prices have boosted consumer and producer 
prices in recent months. The latest data on labor 
costs suggest some slight improvement from earlier 
trends.  

Most interest rates have fallen somewhat since 
the Committee meeting on October 2. In foreign 
exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has 
declined considerably further over the intermeeting 
period.  

In October, M2 grew only slightly after two 
months of relatively rapid expansion, while M3 was 
about unchanged. Through October, expansion of M2 was 
estimated to be somewhat below the middle of the 
Committee's range for the year and growth of M3 near 
the lower end of its range. Expansion of total 
domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near 
the midpoint of its monitoring range.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster price 
stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable 
basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of 
international transactions. In furtherance of these 
objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July 
reaffirmed the range it had established in February 
for M2 growth of 3 to 7 percent, measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990.  
The Committee in July also retained the monitoring 
range of 5 to 9 percent for the year that it had set 
for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. With 
regard to M3, the Committee recognized that the on
going restructuring of thrift depository institutions 
had depressed its growth relative to spending and 
total credit more than anticipated. Taking account of 
the unexpectedly strong M3 velocity, the Committee 
decided in July to reduce the 1990 range to 1 to 5 
percent. For 1991, the Committee agreed on pro
visional ranges for monetary growth, measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991, 
of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent 
for M3. The Committee tentatively set the associated 
monitoring range for growth of total domestic non
financial debt at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1991.  
The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue 
to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price 
level stability, movements in their velocities, and 
developments in the economy and financial markets.



In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the 
existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.  
Taking account of progress toward price stability, the 
strength of the business expansion, the behavior of 
the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign 
exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly 
greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser 
reserve restraint would be acceptable in the inter
meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions 
are expected to be consistent with growth of both M2 
and M3 over the period from September through December 
at annual rates of about 1 to 2 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on Tuesday, December 18, 1990.  

The meeting adjourned.
