By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized 

and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions 

in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 

that economic activity grew at a moderate pace in the 
third quarter. In September total nonfarm payroll 

employment grew somewhat further, although employment 

in manufacturing fell after changing little in August.  

The civilian unemployment rate moved back up to 7.0 
percent in September, close to its average level earlier 

in the year. Industrial production rose slightly further 

in September and posted a moderate gain over the third 

quarter. Consumer spending has remained strong in 

recent months, with gains in retail sales in August 

and especially in September paced by a sharp rise in 

auto sales. Housing starts fell in September, but 

residential investment increased further in the third 

quarter as a whole. Business capital spending appears 

to have remained sluggish; equipment spending picked 

up in the third quarter and new orders were strong in

September, but outlays for nonresidential construction 
continued to decline. Real net exports of goods and 
services dropped further in the third quarter, reflecting 
in large part a surge in the volume of oil imports.  
Increases in labor compensation have slowed over the 
course of the year, while broad measures of prices have 
firmed somewhat recently due to developments in food 
and energy markets.  

Growth of M2 moderated further in September, but 
appears to have picked up in October, while growth of 
M3 has tended to slow. Expansion of these two aggre
gates for the year through September has been at the 
upper end of their respective ranges established by 
the Committee for 1986. Growth of M1 slowed in the 
September-October period from the very rapid pace 
experienced since early spring. Expansion in total 
domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above 
the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Most 
interest rates have declined somewhat since the 
September 23 meeting of the Committee. Although 
the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major 
foreign currencies continued to decline for several 
weeks after the September meeting, it subsequently 
recovered and has risen somewhat on balance.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
and financial conditions that will foster reasonable 
price stability over time, promote growth in output 
on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved 
pattern of international transactions. In furtherance 
of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July 
meeting to reaffirm the ranges established in February 
for growth of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3, measured 
from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter 
of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized 
that, based on the experience of recent years, the 
behavior of that aggregate is subject to substantial 
uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices, 
depending among other things on the responsiveness of M1 
growth to changes in interest rates. In light of these 
uncertainties and of the substantial decline in velocity 
in the first half of the year, the Committee decided 
that growth of M1 in excess of the previously established 
3 to 8 percent range for 1986 would be acceptable.  
Acceptable growth of M1 over the remainder of the year 
will depend on the behavior of velocity, growth in the 
other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy 
and financial markets, and price pressures. Given its 
rapid growth in the early part of the year, the Committee



11/5/86

recognized that the increase in total domestic non
financial debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range 
of 8 to 11 percent, but felt an increase in that range 
would provide an inappropriate benchmark for evaluating 
longer-term trends in that aggregate.  

For 1987 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges 
of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter 
of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987, of 5-1/2 to 
8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3. While a range of 3 to 
8 percent for M1 in 1987 would appear appropriate in 
the light of most historical experience, the Committee 
recognized that the exceptional uncertainties surrounding 
the behavior of M1 velocity over the more recent period 
would require careful appraisal of the target range at 
the beginning of 1987. The associated range for growth 
in total domestic nonfinanical debt was provisionally 
set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action 
is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 
over the period from September to December at annual 
rates of 7 to 9 percent. While growth in M1 over the 
same period is expected to moderate from its exceptional 
pace during the previous several months, growth in this 

aggregate will continue to be judged in the light of 
the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors. Slightly 
greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve 
restraint might be acceptable depending on the behavior 
of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of 
the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange 
markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in 
domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman 
may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the 
Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions 
during the period before the next meeting are likely 
to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently 
outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on December 15-16, 1986.  

The meeting adjourned.
