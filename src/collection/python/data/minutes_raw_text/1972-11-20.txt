11/20-21/72

to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with 

the following current economic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting, including 
recent data for industrial production, employment, and retail 
sales, suggests that real output of goods and services 
is growing more rapidly in the current quarter than in 
the third quarter. However, the unemployment rate has 
remained substantial. The increase in wages has been 
larger in recent months than earlier this year. Consumer 
prices rose considerably in September, but the October 
rise in wholesale prices was small. In recent weeks, the 
current account deficit of the U.S. balance of payments 
has been offset in large part by capital inflows; while 
the reserves of Japan have increased substantially further, 
those of other industrial countries have changed little.  
In September the excess of U.S. merchandise imports over 
exports remained large.  

In October rates of growth in the monetary aggregates 
changed relatively little from preceding months, with 
expansion in the narrowly defined money stock again quite 
moderate. Since mid-October interest rates generally have 
declined.  

In light of the foregoing developments, it is the 
policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster 
financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic 
growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary 
pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the 
country's balance of payments.  

To implement this policy, while taking account of the 
effects of recent bank regulatory changes, the Committee 

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions 
that will support more moderate growth in monetary aggre
gates over the months ahead than recorded in the third 
quarter.  

It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of 

Government securities from the System Open Market Account should be

retained at this time.



11/20-21/72

It was agreed that the 

Market Committee would be held 

9:30 a.m.

next meeting of the Federal Open 

on Tuesday, December 19, 1972, at

The meeting adjourned.
