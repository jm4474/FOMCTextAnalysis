Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets over the period since the March 
FOMC meeting.  Yields on U.S. Treasury securities de-
clined, and the broad index of the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar fell modestly.  These changes report-
edly reflected revisions to investors’ expectations for fis-
cal and other economic policies; some increase in geo-
political tensions; economic and inflation indicators that, 
on balance, were weaker than anticipated; and monetary 
policy communications.  In response to political devel-
opments abroad, spreads on some European sovereign 
debt securities narrowed noticeably.  Measures of im-
plied volatility in equity markets declined, on net, to lev-
els that were historically very low.  Market pricing and 
survey evidence indicated that investors anticipated no 
change in the target range for the federal funds rate at 
this meeting but saw a substantial probability of an in-
crease at the June FOMC meeting; market expectations 
for the path of the federal funds rate further ahead fell 
somewhat.  Federal funds continued to trade well within 
the FOMC’s target range.  Reinvestment of principal 
payments from Treasury and mortgage-backed securities 
held in the SOMA proceeded smoothly.  The manager 
updated the Committee on various small-value tests of 
System operations. 

The manager also briefed the Committee on develop-
ments regarding certain reference interest rates.  
Changes in the practices of some domestic and foreign 
banks for booking certain types of liabilities, as well as 
the effects of recent changes in the regulation of money 
market funds, had resulted in a reduction in the volume 
of Eurodollar transactions reported on the Federal Re-
serve’s Report of Selected Money Market Rates 
(FR 2420).  The staff was in the process of analyzing 
possible revisions to the report that would guard against 
a further erosion of reported transactions and support 
the robustness of the overnight bank funding rate calcu-
lated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Such

revisions might be implemented in conjunction with the 
periodic renewal of authorization for the report, which 
is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2018.  
The manager also noted that aspects of plans to publish 
reference interest rates for market repurchase agree-
ments (repos) were being modified to incorporate a 
newly available source of data on cleared bilateral repo 
transactions; the modifications were expected to extend 
the time frame for publication of the new rates by several 
months.  

The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip-
rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada 
and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ-
ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the 
North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  In ad-
dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the 
dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements 
with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank 
of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na-
tional Bank.  The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s 
participation in these standing arrangements are taken 
annually at the April or May FOMC meeting. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the May 2–3 meeting in-
dicated that the labor market strengthened further in 
March but that growth of real gross domestic product 
(GDP) slowed in the first quarter, with the slowing likely 
reflecting transitory factors.  The 12-month change in 
overall consumer prices was close to the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent in recent months; ex-
cluding food and energy, consumer prices declined in 
March, and the 12-month change in core consumer 
prices remained somewhat below 2 percent.  Survey-
based measures of inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, but 
the gain was smaller than in recent months, likely reflect-
ing both warmer-than-usual temperatures in February 
that probably caused some hiring to be moved forward 
and a major winter storm in the Northeast in March that 
probably held down hiring somewhat; nevertheless, the 
increase in employment for the first quarter as a whole 
was solid.  The unemployment rate decreased to 4.5 per-
cent in March, and the labor force participation rate was 
unchanged.  The share of workers employed part time 

for economic reasons declined.  The rates of private- 
sector job openings, hiring, and quits were all little 
changed in January and February.  The four-week mov-
ing average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits remained at a very low level through mid-April.  
Measures of labor compensation accelerated modestly.  
The employment cost index for private workers in-
creased 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in 
March, and average hourly earnings for all employees in-
creased 2¾ percent over the same period; both increases 
were somewhat larger than those over the 12 months 
ending in March 2016. 

The average unemployment rate for whites in the first 
quarter of this year was ½ percentage point lower than 
its annual average for 2015, while the unemployment 
rates for Hispanics and for African Americans were 
about 1 percentage point and 1¾ percentage points 
lower, respectively.  The larger improvements in the 
rates for Hispanics and for African Americans mirrored 
the larger increases in those rates during the most recent 
recession.  As of the first quarter, the unemployment 
rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained 
above the rate for whites both overall and for people 
with similar educational backgrounds.  Unemployment 
rates for Asians remained below those for whites. 

Total industrial production rose in February and March, 
primarily reflecting a further expansion of mining output 
as well as a net increase in the output of utilities.  Manu-
facturing production declined in March after advancing 
in each of the previous six months; about half of the de-
cline in March was due to a decrease in the output of 
motor vehicles and parts.  Automakers’ assembly sched-
ules suggested that motor vehicle production would in-
crease in the second quarter despite somewhat elevated 
levels of vehicle inventories.  Broader indicators of man-
ufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes 
from national and regional manufacturing surveys, 
pointed to modest gains in factory output over the near 
term. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 
only modestly in the first quarter, although monthly data 
indicated some improvement late in the quarter.  Indeed, 
after declining in January and February, real PCE in-
creased in March, partly reflecting a rebound in spending 
on energy services, which had been held down by unsea-
sonably warm weather through February, as well as an 
increase in outlays for a variety of consumer goods.  Mo-
tor vehicle sales picked up in April after declining in 
March, although sales remained somewhat below their 
average pace in the first quarter and noticeably below the

high levels seen in the fourth quarter.  Recent readings 
on key factors that influence consumer spending pointed 
to solid growth in real PCE in coming quarters, includ-
ing further gains in employment, real disposable per-
sonal income, and households’ net worth.  Moreover, 
consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat in 
March and April. 

Residential investment increased at a brisk pace in the 
first quarter.  Starts for both new single-family homes 
and multifamily units moved up, and issuance of build-
ing permits for new single-family homes—which tends 
to be a reliable indicator of the underlying trend in resi-
dential construction—also rose.  Sales of both new and 
existing homes in the first quarter were above their levels 
in the previous quarter. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property increased at a solid pace in the first 
quarter after a moderate gain in the fourth quarter.  
Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense cap-
ital goods excluding aircraft both rose over the three 
months ending in March, and the level of new orders 
remained higher than that of shipments, pointing to fur-
ther near-term gains in shipments.  In addition, indica-
tors of business sentiment were upbeat in recent 
months.  Real business expenditures for nonresidential 
structures increased briskly in the first quarter, and the 
number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of 
spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, 
continued to rise through mid-April.  Business inventory 
investment slowed sharply last quarter and held down 
real GDP growth significantly. 

Real federal purchases declined in the first quarter, as 
defense expenditures decreased and nondefense spend-
ing rose at a slower pace than in the final quarter of 2016.  
Real state and local government purchases also declined 
in the first quarter, with a sharp decrease in real con-
struction spending by these governments more than off-
setting a modest expansion in state and local govern-
ment payrolls. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in Febru-
ary.  Exports rose and imports fell sharply, with imports 
of automotive products and consumer goods declining 
after robust increases in January.  Preliminary data on 
trade in goods suggested that the trade deficit was about 
unchanged in March.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis 
estimated that real net exports added slightly to growth 
of real GDP in the first quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1¾ percent over the 12 months 
ending in March.  Core PCE price inflation, which ex-
cludes changes in food and energy prices, was about 
1½ percent over those same 12 months.  Over the 
12 months ending in March, total consumer prices as 
measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 
2½ percent, while core CPI inflation was 2 percent.  On 
a month-over-month basis, both the PCE price index 
and the CPI decreased in March, partly reflecting de-
clines in some categories of prices that appeared unlikely 
to be repeated.  The median of longer-run inflation ex-
pectations from the Michigan survey edged down a bit, 
on balance, in recent months, while the medians from 
the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of 
Market Participants were little changed. 

Foreign real GDP growth appeared to have strength-
ened in the first quarter after slowing somewhat in the 
fourth quarter.  In the advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs), indicators for the first quarter pointed to faster 
economic growth in Canada and solid growth in the euro 
area and Japan.  By contrast, real GDP growth in the 
United Kingdom slowed significantly.  More recent in-
dicators were consistent with moderate economic 
growth in most AFEs.  In the emerging market econo-
mies (EMEs), growth picked up in China and some 
Asian economies in the first quarter but slowed moder-
ately in Mexico.  Recent data also suggested that eco-
nomic activity improved in parts of South America, most 
notably in Brazil where positive growth likely resumed 
in the first quarter.  Inflation in the AFEs continued to 
rise, largely because of the pass-through of earlier in-
creases in crude oil prices into retail energy prices.  In 
the EMEs, inflation fell in China in the first quarter, re-
flecting a sharp drop in food prices, but was pushed up 
in Mexico by fuel price hikes and pass-through from past 
currency depreciation. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial market conditions remained gener-
ally accommodative over the intermeeting period.  Prices 
of risky assets increased a bit on net, Treasury yields de-
clined, and the dollar depreciated.  The decline in Treas-
ury yields reportedly was driven in part by investor ex-
pectations of a somewhat slower pace of policy rate in-
creases following FOMC communications after the 
March meeting and some waning of investor optimism 
about prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies. 

FOMC communications over the intermeeting period 
reportedly were interpreted as indicating a somewhat 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

slower pace of policy rate increases than previously ex-
pected but an earlier change to the Committee’s rein-
vestment policy.  Although the Committee’s decision to 
raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the 
March meeting was widely anticipated, some of the ac-
companying communications were viewed as more ac-
commodative than expected.  Investors reportedly also 
took note of the discussion in the March FOMC minutes 
of the Committee’s reinvestment policy as well as state-
ments from some FOMC participants and appeared to 
pull forward their expectations for when the FOMC will 
either announce or start to implement a change to that 
policy.  Overall, however, the market reaction to news 
related to potential changes in reinvestment policy ap-
peared to be fairly limited.  Quotes on overnight index 
swap (OIS) rates pointed to a flattening of the expected 
path of the federal funds rate through 2020, but a staff 
model suggested that a reduction in term premiums ac-
counted for about half the decline in OIS rates. 

Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treas-
ury securities decreased 20 to 35 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.  Investors’ interpretations of 
FOMC communications, market perceptions of a re-
duced likelihood of domestic fiscal and regulatory policy 
changes, weaker-than-expected domestic economic data 
releases, and geopolitical factors and foreign political de-
velopments all reportedly placed downward pressure on 
yields.  A staff term structure model attributed about 
one-third of the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield to 
a decrease in the average expected future short-term rate 
and the remaining two-thirds to a lower term premium.  
While inflation compensation based on Treasury  
Inflation-Protected Securities decreased at near-term 
horizons, partly reflecting the lower-than-expected 
March CPI release, far-term inflation compensation was 
little changed on net. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased slightly, on 
net, since the March FOMC meeting.  One-month-
ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—
the VIX—rose appreciably in mid-April, reflecting in 
part increased investor concerns about geopolitical fac-
tors and foreign political developments, but ended the 
period slightly lower, as investor concerns appeared to 
ease after the first round of the French presidential elec-
tion.  Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields on 
investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corpo-
rate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities 
narrowed a bit on net.  Private-sector analysts continued 
to project robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over 

2017 even as first-quarter earnings, on a seasonally ad-
justed basis, were estimated to be a bit lower than in the 
fourth quarter. 

Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Reflecting the FOMC’s 
policy action in March, yields on a broad set of money 
market instruments moved higher.  Treasury bills out-
standing, which had declined before the reimposition of 
the federal debt ceiling on March 15, moved higher 
thereafter, partly in connection with the Treasury’s steps 
to rebuild its cash balance.  Take-up at the System’s over-
night reverse repurchase agreement facility, which had 
risen ahead of the debt ceiling date, remained high 
through March and then fell to relatively low levels after 
quarter-end. 

Financing conditions for large nonfinancial firms stayed 
accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds and 
leveraged loans remained strong in March, with a large 
share of lower-rated debt issued for refinancing pur-
poses.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses in-
creased in the first quarter but remained noticeably be-
low the pace of the same time last year.  According to 
the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices (SLOOS), a modest share of domestic 
banks reported weaker demand for commercial and in-
dustrial (C&I) loans, on net, in the first quarter, mainly 
citing several factors that pertained to customers’ re-
duced needs for financing.  C&I lending continued to be 
soft early in the second quarter. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
were broadly unchanged on net.  Spreads on commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) widened slightly 
over the period since the March FOMC meeting but re-
mained near the lower end of the range seen since the 
financial crisis.  CMBS issuance picked up in March, re-
portedly reflecting a return to a more normal pace after 
the adoption of a credit risk retention rule in late De-
cember caused some issuance to be shifted from January 
and February into the fourth quarter.  Growth of CRE 
loans on banks’ books slowed in the first quarter but 
continued to be robust overall.  Domestic respondents 
to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their 
lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand 
across all major CRE loan categories during the first 
quarter. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Credit 
availability continued to be relatively tight for house-
holds with low credit scores or harder-to-document in-

comes but relatively accommodative for other house-
holds.  Mortgage rates declined in line with yields on 
longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed 
securities, but they remained elevated compared with the 
very low levels of the third quarter of 2016.  Consistent 
with these developments, refinance originations slowed 
considerably since the third quarter.  In the April 
SLOOS, banks reported roughly unchanged standards 
on residential real estate (RRE) loans on average.  Banks 
also reported that demand for some categories of RRE 
loans weakened during the first quarter, including those 
insured or guaranteed by government agencies.  In line 
with lower reported demand, growth in RRE loans on 
banks’ balance sheets declined. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained accommodative, on balance, in early 2017.  Con-
sumer credit appeared to be broadly available even as in-
terest rates charged on credit card balances and new auto 
loans drifted up in line with their benchmark shorter-
term interest rates.  Growth in consumer loan balances 
moderated a bit further from the relatively strong pace 
seen during the past few years, although year-over-year 
growth in credit card balances, student loans, and auto 
loans stayed in the 6 to 7 percent range through Febru-
ary.  In the April SLOOS, banks reported tightening 
standards on auto loans and easing standards on credit 
card loans; banks also reported facing weaker demand 
for both auto and credit card loans. 

Over the intermeeting period, movements in foreign fi-
nancial markets were driven by central bank communi-
cations in the United States and abroad, geopolitical 
risks, and changes in investors’ perceptions about future 
U.S. fiscal and other government policies.  Concerns 
about the outcome of the French presidential election 
and tensions in the Korean peninsula pushed down 
10-year sovereign yields in the advanced economies for 
several weeks.  Sentiment improved following the out-
come of the first round of the French presidential elec-
tion on April 23, which led to a partial retracement in 
yields.  At their meetings on April 27, the European Cen-
tral Bank and the Bank of Japan each left their policy 
stance unchanged.  On net, foreign yields declined some-
what less than U.S. yields, contributing to a modest de-
preciation of the dollar against both the AFE and EME 
currencies.  Equity indexes in most advanced and emerg-
ing economies rose.  Flows to emerging market mutual 
funds remained strong, and spreads on emerging market 
debt were little changed. 

The staff provided its latest report on the potential risks 
to financial stability; it continued to characterize the fi-
nancial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as 
moderate on balance.  This overall assessment reflected 
the staff’s judgment that leverage as well as vulnerabili-
ties from maturity and liquidity transformation in the fi-
nancial sector were low, that leverage in the nonfinancial 
sector was moderate, and that asset valuation pressures 
in some markets were notable.  Although these assess-
ments were unchanged from January’s assessment, vul-
nerabilities appeared to have increased for asset valua-
tion pressures, though not by enough to warrant raising 
the assessment of these vulnerabilities to elevated. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for 
the May FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was pro-
jected to bounce back in the second quarter from its 
weak first-quarter reading.  The staff judged that the 
weakness in first-quarter real GDP was probably not at-
tributable to residual seasonality and that it instead re-
flected transitorily soft consumer expenditures and in-
ventory investment.  Importantly, PCE growth was ex-
pected to pick up to a stronger pace in the spring, which 
would be more consistent with ongoing gains in employ-
ment, real disposable personal income, and households’ 
net worth.  In addition, the sharp decrease in the contri-
bution to GDP growth from the change in inventory in-
vestment in the first quarter was not expected to be re-
peated.  Beyond the near term, the forecast for real GDP 
growth was a little stronger, on net, than in the previous 
projection, mostly due to the effect of a somewhat lower 
assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar.  The 
staff continued to project that real GDP would expand 
at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 
2017 through 2019, supported in part by the staff’s 
maintained assumption that fiscal policy would become 
more expansionary in the coming years.  The unemploy-
ment rate was projected to decline gradually over the 
next couple of years and to run somewhat below the 
staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this pe-
riod; the staff’s estimate of the natural rate was revised 
down slightly in this forecast. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as 
measured by changes in the PCE price index, was re-
vised down marginally for 2017 as a whole after incor-
porating the soft data on consumer prices for March, but 
it was essentially unrevised thereafter.  Inflation was still 
expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, 
reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and  
non-energy imports as well as a slightly faster increase in 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

energy prices.  The staff continued to project that infla-
tion would increase gradually in 2018 and 2019 and that 
it would be marginally below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to 
the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment 
that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to 
respond to large positive shocks to the economic out-
look than to substantial adverse ones.  However, the 
staff viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced 
than late last year, with both somewhat diminished risks 
to the foreign outlook and an increase in U.S. consumer 
and business confidence.  Consistent with the downside 
risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to 
its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the 
upside.  The risks to the projection for inflation were 
judged to be roughly balanced.  The downside risks from 
the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations 
may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate 
substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by 
the upside risk that inflation could increase more than 
expected in an economy that was projected to continue 
operating above its longer-run potential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that the infor-
mation received over the intermeeting period indicated 
that the labor market had continued to strengthen even 
as growth in economic activity slowed in the first quar-
ter.  Job gains remained solid, on average, in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate declined.  House-
hold spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals 
underpinning the continued growth of consumption re-
mained solid.  Business fixed investment firmed in the 
first quarter after increasing only slowly over the previ-
ous two years.  Inflation measured on a 12-month basis 
recently had been running close to the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective; consumer prices, both 
including and excluding prices of energy and food items, 
declined in March, and core inflation continued to run 
somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation remained low; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed on balance. 

Although the incoming data showed that aggregate 
spending in the first quarter had been weaker than par-
ticipants had expected, they viewed the slowing as likely 
to be transitory.  They continued to expect that, with 
further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace, labor market conditions would strengthen some-
what further, and inflation would stabilize around 2 per-
cent over the medium term. 

Participants generally indicated that their assessments of 
the medium-term economic outlook had changed little 
since the March meeting, and they discussed various rea-
sons why the softness in consumer spending in the first 
quarter was likely to be transitory.  Some participants 
judged that the low reading on GDP growth also could 
partly reflect residual seasonality and so would likely be 
followed by stronger GDP growth in subsequent quar-
ters, repeating a pattern evidenced in recent years.  A few 
emphasized the uncertainty with regard to the reasons 
for the unexpected weakness in consumer spending but 
considered it too early to judge the implications for the 
outlook.  Many pointed to the recent firming of the 
housing market and business fixed investment as wel-
come developments. 

Overall, participants continued to see the near-term risks 
to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.  Many par-
ticipants saw the risks stemming from global economic 
and financial developments as having receded further 
over the intermeeting period.  They pointed to the en-
couraging tone of recent data on economic growth 
abroad, which suggested some upside risks to foreign 
economic activity.  However, several noted that down-
side risks to the global outlook remained, either because 
of geopolitical developments and foreign political fac-
tors or because monetary policy normalization in the 
United States could lead to financial strains in EMEs.  
Many participants continued to view the possibility of 
expansionary fiscal policy changes in the United States 
as posing upside risks to their forecasts for U.S. eco-
nomic growth, although they also noted that prospects 
for enactment of a more expansionary fiscal program, as 
well as its size, composition, and timing, remained highly 
uncertain.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, a couple 
of participants expressed concern that a substantial un-
dershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-
ment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation.  
However, several others continued to see downside risks 
to the inflation outlook, particularly given the low read-
ings on inflation over the intermeeting period and the 
still-low measures of inflation compensation and infla-

tion expectations.  Participants agreed that the Commit-
tee should continue to closely monitor inflation indica-
tors and global economic and financial developments. 

While recent data suggested a significant slowdown of 
growth in consumption spending early in the year, par-
ticipants expected to see a rebound in consumer spend-
ing in coming months in light of the solid fundamentals 
underpinning household spending, including ongoing 
job gains, rising household income and wealth, im-
proved household balance sheets, and buoyant con-
sumer sentiment.  It was noted that much of the recent 
slowing likely reflected transitory factors, such as low 
consumer spending for energy services induced by an 
unusually mild winter and a decline in motor vehicle 
sales from an unsustainably high fourth-quarter pace.  
Nevertheless, contacts expected that demand for motor 
vehicles would be well maintained.  District reports on 
the service sector were generally positive, although one 
District’s contacts in the tourism industry reported a 
falloff in international visitors.  One participant noted 
that retail contacts reported upbeat projections for 
online sales and associated package delivery services, in 
part reflecting structural shifts in the retail industry. 

Several participants discussed the pickup in residential 
investment in the first quarter.  Starts and permits for 
single-family housing continued to post moderate in-
creases, while sales of new homes rose strongly from 
their level in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Business con-
tacts in some Districts reported that residential construc-
tion activity had not kept pace with demand, resulting in 
shortages in housing supply and upward pressure on 
prices. 

Business fixed investment increased at a solid pace in the 
first quarter, led by a rebound in drilling for oil and nat-
ural gas.  Several participants noted that rising orders for 
capital goods suggested further gains in business equip-
ment investment over coming quarters.  Business con-
tacts reported increases in activity in the manufacturing 
and energy sectors.  Contacts in many Districts were said 
to be generally optimistic about business prospects.  Sev-
eral participants noted that surveys of business condi-
tions in their Districts continued to indicate expanding 
activity.  A few participants commented that firms en-
gaged in international trade were benefiting from im-
provements in global demand conditions.  Several par-
ticipants reported that firms in their Districts planned to 
increase capital expenditures, although in another Dis-
trict, uncertainty about changes in trade and regulatory 
policies was said to be weighing on capital spending.  

Conditions in the agricultural sector remained weak, 
partly as a result of low commodity prices. 

Labor market conditions strengthened further in recent 
months.  At 4.5 percent, the unemployment rate had 
reached or fallen below levels that participants judged 
likely to be normal over the longer run.  Increases in 
nonfarm payroll employment averaged almost 
180,000 per month during the first quarter, a pace that, 
if maintained, would be expected to result in further in-
creases in labor utilization over time.  Labor market con-
ditions in many Districts were reported to have contin-
ued to improve.  Contacts in several Districts reported a 
pickup in wage increases, shortages of workers in se-
lected occupations, or pressures to train workers for 
hard-to-fill jobs.  Even so, several other participants sug-
gested some margins may remain along which labor mar-
ket utilization could increase further without giving rise 
to inflationary pressures.  In that regard, they noted that 
the recent rise in the labor force participation rate in the 
face of a downward trend from demographic factors was 
a positive development.  However, a couple of partici-
pants pointed out that uncertainty about both the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment and labor 
force trends made it difficult to assess the scope for ad-
ditional sustainable increases in labor utilization.  Gen-
erally, participants continued to expect that if economic 
growth stayed moderate, as they projected, the unem-
ployment rate would remain, for the next few years, be-
low their estimates of its longer-run normal level.  A few 
participants continued to anticipate a substantial under-
shooting of the longer-run normal level of the unem-
ployment rate. 

Readings on headline and core PCE price inflation in 
March had come in lower than expected.  On a 
12-month basis, headline PCE price inflation had edged 
above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in February, 
but this measure dropped back to 1.8 percent in March, 
in part reflecting the effects of lower energy prices on 
the headline index.  Core PCE price inflation, which his-
torically has been a good predictor of future headline in-
flation, moved down to 1.6 percent over the 12 months 
ending in March.  However, it was noted that some of 
this slowing reflected idiosyncratic factors such as a large 
drop in the measure of quality-adjusted prices for wire-
less telephone services.  Several participants emphasized 
that inflation measured on a 12-month basis had been 
running very close to the Committee’s 2 percent target.  
Overall, most participants viewed the recent softer infla-
tion data as primarily reflecting transitory factors, but a 
few expressed concern that progress toward the Com-
mittee’s objective may have slowed. Market-based

measures of longer-term inflation compensation re-
mained low, with five-year, five-year-forward CPI infla-
tion compensation a bit below 2 percent—unchanged 
from the time of the March FOMC meeting but some-
what above levels registered last year.  In addition, the 
median measure of inflation expectations over the next 
5 to 10 years in the Michigan survey edged down from 
2.5 percent in February to 2.4 percent in March and 
April.  The three-year-ahead measure of inflation expec-
tations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 
Survey of Consumer Expectations decreased from 
3.0 percent to 2.7 percent in March and rose to 2.9 per-
cent in April.   

In light of these developments, participants generally 
continued to expect that inflation would stabilize around 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium 
run as the effects of transitory factors waned and condi-
tions in the labor market and the overall economy im-
proved further.  Participants noted that import prices 
had begun to increase, supporting their expectation that 
inflation would gradually rise.  A few participants, how-
ever, expressed uncertainty about the reasons for the re-
cent unexpected weakness in inflation measures and 
about its implications for the inflation outlook. 

In their discussion of recent developments in financial 
markets, some participants commented on changes in fi-
nancial conditions in the wake of the Committee’s deci-
sion to increase the target range for the federal funds rate 
in March.  They noted variously that the decline in 
longer-term interest rates and the modest depreciation 
of the dollar over the intermeeting period would provide 
some stimulus to aggregate demand, that the Commit-
tee’s recent policy actions had not resulted in a tighten-
ing of financial conditions, or that some of the decline 
in longer-term yields reflected investors’ perceptions of 
diminished odds of significant fiscal stimulus and an in-
crease in some geopolitical and foreign political risks. 

With regard to financial stability, several participants em-
phasized that higher requirements for capital and liquid-
ity in the banking system and other prudential standards 
had contributed to increased resilience in the financial 
system since the financial crisis.  However, they ex-
pressed concerns that a possible easing of regulatory 
standards could increase risks to financial stability.  In 
addition, it was noted that real estate values were ele-
vated in some sectors of the CRE market, that a sharp 
decline in such valuations could pose risks to financial 
stability, and that potential reforms in the housing fi-
nance sector could have implications for such valua-
tions.   

In their consideration of monetary policy, participants 
judged that it was appropriate to leave the target range 
for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  Al-
though the data on aggregate spending and inflation re-
ceived over the intermeeting period were, on balance, 
weaker than participants expected, they generally saw the 
outlook for the economy and inflation as little changed 
and judged that a continued gradual removal of mone-
tary policy accommodation remained appropriate.  A 
couple of participants indicated that increasing the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the current meeting 
would be warranted by their economic outlook, but they 
also noted that maintaining the current stance of policy 
for now would be consistent with the Committee’s grad-
ual approach or that the Committee’s recent communi-
cations had not pointed to an increase at this meeting.  
Most participants judged that if economic information 
came in about in line with their expectations, it would 
soon be appropriate for the Committee to take another 
step in removing some policy accommodation.  A num-
ber of participants pointed out that clarification of pro-
spective fiscal and other policy changes would remove 
one source of uncertainty for the economic outlook.  
Participants generally agreed that the current stance of 
monetary policy remained accommodative, supporting 
some additional strengthening in labor market condi-
tions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. 

Participants generally reiterated their support for a con-
tinued gradual approach to raising the federal funds rate.  
Some participants noted that core PCE price inflation 
had been running below the Committee’s objective for 
overall inflation for the past eight years and that it was 
important to return inflation to 2 percent, or that the 
public’s longer-term inflation expectations may have 
fallen somewhat, and that a gradual approach to tighten-
ing could help return expectations and inflation to 2 per-
cent.  One participant cited results of a District survey 
of businesses indicating that more than one-third of re-
spondents saw the Federal Reserve as more likely to ac-
cept inflation below its 2 percent objective than above; 
that participant interpreted the survey results as suggest-
ing that the Committee’s communications about the 
symmetry of its inflation objective had not completely 
taken hold, a concern also mentioned by a couple of 
other participants.  Another participant observed that a 
gradual approach was appropriate because the neutral 
rate of interest had declined and considerable uncer-
tainty prevailed about its longer-run level.  Several par-
ticipants, however, pointed to conditions under which 
the Committee might need to consider a somewhat 
more rapid removal of monetary accommodation—for

instance, if the unemployment rate fell appreciably fur-
ther than currently projected, if wages increased more 
rapidly than expected, or if highly stimulative fiscal pol-
icy changes were to be enacted.  In contrast, a couple of 
others judged that the Committee could withdraw mon-
etary accommodation even more gradually than re-
flected in the medians of forecasts in the March Sum-
mary of Economic Projections, noting that slack might 
remain in the labor market or that inflation was not very 
sensitive to declines in the unemployment rate below its 
estimated longer-run normal level. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in March indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen even as growth in 
economic activity had slowed.  Job gains had remained 
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had declined.  Household spending had risen 
only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the 
continued growth of consumption remained solid, while 
business fixed investment had firmed. 

Inflation, measured as the 12-month change in the head-
line PCE price index, had been running close to the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  Core infla-
tion continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.  Both 
headline and core consumer price indexes fell in March.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation had 
remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations had changed little on bal-
ance. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members agreed that the 
slowing in growth during the first quarter was likely to 
be transitory and continued to expect that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic 
activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market 
conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and in-
flation would stabilize around 2 percent over the me-
dium term.  Members continued to judge that there was 
significant uncertainty about the effects of possible 
changes in fiscal and other government policies but that 
near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared 
roughly balanced.  A couple of members noted that the 
outlook for global growth appeared to have brightened 
and that downside risks from abroad had waned.  Mem-
bers agreed that they would continue to closely monitor 
inflation indicators and global economic and financial 
developments. 

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers agreed to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¾ to 1 percent.  They noted that the stance 
of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby 
supporting some further strengthening in labor market 
conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. 

Members generally judged that it would be prudent to 
await additional evidence indicating that the recent slow-
ing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory 
before taking another step in removing accommodation.  
Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size 
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to its objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This as-
sessment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  Members also agreed to continue to carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation developments rel-
ative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal, with 
one member viewing further progress of inflation to-
ward the 2 percent objective as necessary before taking 
another step to remove policy accommodation.  Mem-
bers expected that economic conditions would evolve in 
a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate.  Members agreed that the federal 
funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below 
levels that they expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, they noted that the actual path of the federal 
funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as 
informed by incoming data. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting all principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securi-
ties in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling 
over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Members 
anticipated doing so until normalization of the level of 
the federal funds rate was well under way, and they noted 
that this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.:

“Effective May 4, 2017, the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee directs the Desk to undertake 
open market operations as necessary to main-
tain the federal funds rate in a target range of 
¾ to 1 percent, including overnight reverse re-
purchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 0.75 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per- 
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in March indicates that 
the labor market has continued to strengthen 
even as growth in economic activity slowed.  
Job gains were solid, on average, in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate declined.  
Household spending rose only modestly, but 
the fundamentals underpinning the continued 
growth of consumption remained solid.  Busi-
ness fixed investment firmed.  Inflation meas-
ured on a 12-month basis recently has been run-
ning close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-
run objective.  Excluding energy and food, con-
sumer prices declined in March and inflation 
continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion remain low; survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee views the 
slowing in growth during the first quarter as 
likely to be transitory and continues to expect 

that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand 
at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will 
strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will 
stabilize around 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook 
appear roughly balanced.  The Committee con-
tinues to closely monitor inflation indicators 
and global economic and financial develop-
ments. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¾ to 1 percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a sustained re-
turn to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.”

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kash-
kari, and Jerome H. Powell. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-
changed at 1 percent and voted unanimously to approve 
establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) 
at the existing level of 1½ percent.6  

System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy 
Participants continued their discussion of issues related 
to potential changes to the Committee’s policy of rein-
vesting principal payments from securities held in the 
SOMA.  The staff provided a briefing that summarized 
a possible operational approach to reducing the System’s 
securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.  
Under the proposed approach, the Committee would 
announce a set of gradually increasing caps, or limits, on 
the dollar amounts of Treasury and agency securities that 
would be allowed to run off each month, and only the 
amounts of securities repayments that exceeded the caps 
would be reinvested each month.  As the caps increased, 
reinvestments would decline, and the monthly reduc-
tions in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings would 
become larger.  The caps would initially be set at low 
levels and then be raised every three months, over a set 
period of time, to their fully phased-in levels.  The final 
values of the caps would then be maintained until the 
size of the balance sheet was normalized. 

Nearly all policymakers expressed a favorable view of 
this general approach.  Policymakers noted that prean-
nouncing a schedule of gradually increasing caps to limit 
the amounts of securities that could run off in any given 
month was consistent with the Committee’s intention to 
reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in a 

gradual and predictable manner as stated in the Commit-
tee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  Limit-
ing the magnitude of the monthly reductions in the Fed-
eral Reserve’s securities holdings on an ongoing basis 
could help mitigate the risk of adverse effects on market 
functioning or outsized effects on interest rates.  The ap-
proach would also likely be fairly straightforward to 
communicate.  Moreover, under this approach, the pro-
cess of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities hold-
ings, once begun, could likely proceed without a need for 
the Committee to make adjustments as long as there was 
no material deterioration in the economic outlook. 

Policymakers agreed that the Committee’s Policy Nor-
malization Principles and Plans should be augmented 
soon to provide additional details about the operational 
plan to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings 
over time.  Nearly all policymakers indicated that as long 
as the economy and the path of the federal funds rate 
evolved as currently expected, it likely would be appro-
priate to begin reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings this year.  Policymakers agreed to continue in 
June their discussion of plans for a change to the Com-
mittee’s reinvestment policy. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 13–14, 
2017.  The meeting adjourned at 11:45 a.m. on May 3, 
2017.  

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on April 4, 2017, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on March 14–15, 2017.
