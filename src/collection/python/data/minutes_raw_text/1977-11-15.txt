By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed 

by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account 

in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting 
suggests that growth in real output of goods 
and services is picking up in the current 
quarter from the reduced pace in the third 
quarter. The dollar value of total retail 
sales, which had been unchanged in September, 
rose substantially in October. Industrial pro
duction and employment increased somewhat.  
The unemployment rate, at 7.0 per cent, remained 
in the narrow range prevailing since April. The 
wholesale price index for all commodities rose 
sharply in October, as average prices of farm 
products and foods increased after having 
declined appreciably over the preceding 4 months.  
Prices of industrial commodities rose at about 
the average rate of the preceding 12 months.  
The index of average hourly earnings increased 
sharply in September and has advanced at a some
what faster pace so far this year than it had 
on the average during 1976.  

The trade-weighted value of the dollar 
against major foreign currencies has declined 
further since mid-October. In September the 
U. S. foreign trade deficit was reduced some
what, in part as a result of temporary factors.  

M-1 and M-2 increased substantially in 
October, but growth slowed sharply in early 
November. In October inflows to banks of the 
total of savings deposits and small-denomina
tion time deposits fell off, but banks expanded 
the outstanding volume of large-denomination 
CD's substantially as credit demands strengthened.

Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed 
somewhat in October from the strong pace of 
the preceding 2 months. Following a sub
stantial rise in member bank borrowings, 
Federal Reserve discount rates were increased 
from 5-3/4 to 6 per cent in late October.  
Market interest rates have fluctuated moderately 
since mid-October and most recently have tended 
to decline.  

In light of the foregoing developments, it 
is the policy of the Federal Open Market 
Committee to foster bank reserve and other 
financial conditions that will encourage con
tinued economic expansion and help resist 
inflationary pressures, while contributing to 
a sustainable pattern of international trans
actions.  

At its meeting on October 18, 1977, the 
Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and 
M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 
to 9 per cent, and 8 to 10-1/2 per cent, 
respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to 
the third quarter of 1978 appears to be con
sistent with these objectives. These ranges are 
subject to reconsideration at any time as 
conditions warrant.  

At this time, the Committee seeks to main
tain about the prevailing money market conditions 
during the period immediately ahead, provided 
that monetary aggregates appear to be growing 
at approximately the rates currently expected, 
which are believed to be on a path reasonably 
consistent with the longer-run ranges for 
monetary aggregates cited in the preceding 
paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks 
to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds 
rate at about the current level, so long as 
M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the 
November-December period at annual rates within 
ranges of 1 to 7 per cent and 5 to 9 per cent, 
respectively. If, giving approximately equal 
weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth

rates over the 2-month period are approaching 
or moving beyond the limits of the indicated 
ranges, the operational objective for the 
weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be 
modified in an orderly fashion within a range 
of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 per cent.  

If it appears during the period before the 
next meeting that the operating constraints 
specified above are proving to be significantly 
inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify 
the Chairman who will then decide whether the 
situation calls for supplementary instructions 
from the Committee.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 

would be held on Tuesday, December 20, 1977, beginning at 

9:30 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.
