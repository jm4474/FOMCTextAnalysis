Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation 
Framework 
Committee participants continued their discussion of 
potential long-run frameworks for monetary policy im-
plementation, a topic last discussed at the July 2016 
FOMC meeting.  The staff provided briefings that sum-
marized considerations regarding potential choices of 
policy rates, operating regimes, and balance sheet poli-
cies and highlighted tradeoffs associated with these 
choices. 

The staff noted that if the long-run implementation 
framework was such that the supply of reserve balances 
was quite abundant, then operational tools that help es-
tablish a floor under short-term interest rates, such as 
the payment of interest on reserves and the overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, would 
remain important elements of the operating regime.  Re-
serve requirements would probably not be necessary in 
this case, and the Federal Reserve could likely maintain 
control of short-term interest rates without needing to 
conduct frequent open market operations to adjust the 
supply of reserves.  Such an approach could also be ef-
fective with an appreciably smaller balance sheet and 
supply of reserves than at present.  In contrast, if in the 
long run the supply of reserves was quite small, such as 
was the situation before the financial crisis, either reserve

requirements or voluntary reserve targets would proba-
bly be needed to help stabilize the demand for reserves 
and increase its predictability.  The Federal Reserve 
would likely need to conduct frequent open market op-
erations in this case to maintain adequate control of 
short-term interest rates, and banks would probably 
trade actively in the federal funds market.  Some short-
term interest rates could display greater volatility under 
this approach than one in which the level of reserve bal-
ances was relatively high, and operational tools to limit 
both downward and upward pressure on such rates 
would probably be needed.  Regardless of the level of 
reserves, the policy rate in either of these cases could be 
an unsecured overnight market rate or an interest rate 
administered by the Federal Reserve.  The FOMC might 
instead target an overnight Treasury repurchase agree-
ment rate and use standing facilities to keep repurchase 
agreement rates close to the target level.  

The staff noted the importance of having effective ar-
rangements to provide liquidity in times of stress.  
Stigma associated with borrowing from the discount 
window has likely prevented it from effectively enhanc-
ing control of short-term interest rates and improving 
liquidity conditions in various situations. Possible op-
tions to provide appropriate liquidity when necessary 
while mitigating such stigma were mentioned.   

The staff discussed the possibility that changes in the 
size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet, including the duration of its securities holdings, 
could be used to help achieve policymakers’ macroeco-
nomic goals when short-term interest rates had declined 
to their effective lower bound—and conceivably when 
short-term interest rates were above that bound.  The 
staff also described the possibility of using balance sheet 
policies to promote financial stability. 

In the discussion that followed the staff presentations, 
policymakers agreed that decisions regarding the long-
run implementation framework were not necessary at 
this time.  They indicated that the current framework 
was working well and that, with the supply of reserve 
balances expected to remain large for a while, the present 
approach to policy implementation would likely remain 
appropriate for some time.  Moreover, policymakers ex-
pected to benefit from accruing additional information 
before making judgments about a future implementation 
framework.  For example, they acknowledged that re-
cent changes in financial regulations were likely to con-
tinue to be an important factor in the ongoing evolution 
of financial markets.  Policymakers also underscored the 

importance of taking account of the possibility that neu-
tral short-term interest rates could remain quite low.  For 
these reasons, policymakers emphasized that their cur-
rent views regarding the long-run policy implementation 
framework were preliminary and they expected that fur-
ther deliberations would be appropriate before decisions 
were made. 

Meeting participants commented on the advantages of 
using an approach to policy implementation in which ac-
tive management of the supply of reserves would not be 
required.  Such an approach could be compatible with a 
balance sheet that was much smaller than at present, 
though likely at least somewhat larger than in the years 
before the financial crisis, reflecting trend growth of bal-
ance sheet items such as currency as well as a larger sup-
ply of reserves.  In addition, such an approach was seen 
as likely to be relatively simple and efficient to adminis-
ter, relatively straightforward to communicate, and ef-
fective in enabling interest rate control across a wide 
range of circumstances.  A number of policymakers 
stated that they continued to view expansion of the bal-
ance sheet through large-scale asset purchases as an im-
portant tool to provide macroeconomic stimulus in sit-
uations in which short-term interest rates were at their 
effective lower bound.  Most participants did not indi-
cate support for using the balance sheet as an active tool 
in other situations or for other purposes, although a few 
expressed support for undertaking further study of this 
possibility.  Policymakers noted the merits of relying on 
a policy rate that would be robust to shifts in financial 
market structure, practices, and regulations as well as to 
changes in premiums for credit risk.  Other important 
considerations for the choice of policy rate included the 
volatility of the rate, the breadth of the set of Federal 
Reserve counterparties that would be required to ensure 
adequate control of short-term interest rates, and the 
role of the policy rate in FOMC communications.   

At the end of the discussion, the Chair reiterated that 
additional experience with the Federal Reserve’s current 
monetary policy implementation framework would help 
inform policymakers’ future deliberation of issues re-
lated to a long-run framework and that decisions regard-
ing these issues would not be required for some time.  
The Chair also noted that the Federal Reserve would 
proceed cautiously and would communicate any in-
tended changes to its approach to implementing mone-
tary policy well in advance of making the changes.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open  
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in financial markets 
during the period since the Committee met on Septem-
ber 20–21, 2016, including changes in market expecta-
tions for U.S. monetary policy, adjustments to foreign 
central bank monetary policies, and the evolution of in-
vestors’ views about risk factors in global financial mar-
kets.  The deputy manager followed with a briefing on 
open market operations and developments in money 
markets.  The implementation on October 14 of reforms 
to the money market fund (MMF) industry generally 
proceeded smoothly, although the shift in investments 
from prime to government-only money funds had been 
substantial and left an imprint on levels of some money 
market interest rates.  Largely reflecting this shift, usage 
of the System’s ON RRP facility rose somewhat further 
in the most recent intermeeting period.  Federal funds 
generally continued to trade close to the middle of the 
FOMC’s target range of ¼ to ½ percent.  The deputy 
manager also updated the Committee on implementa-
tion of the new framework for investment of foreign 
currency reserves and on a proposal to publish data se-
ries on interest rates in the market for general collateral 
repurchase agreements.  

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the November 1–2 meet-
ing indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) ex-
panded at a faster pace in the third quarter than in the 
first half of the year and that labor market conditions 
continued to strengthen in recent months.  Consumer 
price inflation increased further above its pace early in 
the year but was still running below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by 
earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-
energy imports.  Most survey-based measures of longer-
run inflation expectations were little changed, on bal-
ance, while market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation moved up but remained low. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid 
pace in September, and the unemployment rate was little 
changed at 5.0 percent.  The labor force participation 
rate and the employment-to-population ratio both edged 
up in September.  The share of workers employed part 

time for economic reasons was still slightly elevated rel-
ative to its level before the recession.  The rate of pri-
vate-sector job openings edged down in August, and the 
rates of hiring and of quits were unchanged.  The four-
week moving average of initial claims for unemployment 
insurance benefits remained low.  Measures of labor 
compensation continued to rise at a moderate pace.  The 
employment cost index for private industry workers in-
creased 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in Sep-
tember, and average hourly earnings for all employees 
increased 2½ percent over the same 12-month period. 

The unemployment rates for African Americans and for 
Hispanics remained above the rate for whites but were 
close to the levels seen just prior to the most recent re-
cession.  The labor force participation rate for white in-
dividuals aged 25 to 54 continued to be higher than for 
African Americans and for Hispanics, but the rates for 
all three groups appeared to have either moved sideways 
or edged up recently. 

Total industrial production increased slightly in Septem-
ber after little change, on net, in July and August.  Mining 
output continued to rise, on balance, in recent months, 
but manufacturing production was little changed.  Over 
the previous two years, manufacturing output was rela-
tively flat, reflecting the effects of weak export demand, 
spillovers from the earlier declines in crude oil and nat-
ural gas drilling, and slow domestic capital investment 
more generally.  Automakers’ assembly schedules sug-
gested that motor vehicle production would be about 
unchanged in the near term, and broader indicators of 
manufacturing production, such as the new orders in-
dexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, 
pointed toward only tepid gains, at best, in factory out-
put in the coming months. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in-
creased at a moderate pace in the third quarter, sup-
ported by continued gains in employment, real disposa-
ble personal income, and households’ net worth.  Con-
sumer spending increased in September, partly because 
of an increase in outlays for motor vehicles.  Indeed, unit 
sales of light motor vehicles rose sharply in September 
and moved higher in October, supported in part by siz-
able sales incentives.  In addition, consumer sentiment 
as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers remained relatively upbeat in October. 

Housing market activity was weak in the third quarter.  
Real residential investment spending decreased, partly 
reflecting a decline in total housing starts.  The most re-
cent construction data were mixed, with starts for new 
single-family homes increasing in September and starts 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

for multifamily units declining sharply.  Building permit 
issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to 
be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construc-
tion—was little changed, on balance, in recent months 
and had remained essentially flat since late last year.  
Sales of new homes decreased, on net, in August and 
September, but sales of existing homes increased mod-
estly. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property were about flat in the third quarter.  
New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding air-
craft were little changed over August and September, but 
orders were somewhat above the level of shipments, 
suggesting a modest pickup in business spending for 
equipment in the near term.  Real business expenditures 
for nonresidential structures increased in the third quar-
ter, and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an 
indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and 
mining sector, continued to edge up in October.  Real 
inventory investment was positive in the third quarter 
after subtracting substantially from real GDP growth in 
the second quarter.  Except in the energy sector, inven-
tories generally seemed well aligned with the pace of 
sales. 

Real federal purchases increased in the third quarter, as 
defense expenditures turned up and nondefense spend-
ing continued to rise.  Real state and local government 
purchases decreased, reflecting a decline in real con-
struction spending by these governments that more than 
offset a net expansion in state and local government pay-
rolls during the third quarter. 

Net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth 
in the third quarter, largely because of the strength of 
soybean exports.  The nominal U.S. international trade 
deficit widened in August relative to July, as imports rose 
more than exports.  Import growth was driven by higher 
imports of capital goods and services, while export 
growth was led in part by higher exports of industrial 
supplies and automotive products.  The Census Bureau’s 
advance trade estimates for September suggested a nar-
rowing of the trade deficit, with further growth in ex-
ports and a decline in imports relative to August. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased about 1¼ percent over the 
12 months ending in September, partly restrained by re-
cent decreases in consumer food prices and earlier de-
clines in consumer energy prices.  Core PCE price infla-
tion, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, 
was about 1¾ percent over those same 12 months, held 
down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy 

imports over part of this period and by the pass-through 
of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of 
other goods and services.  Over the 12 months ending 
in September, total consumer prices as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI) rose 1½ percent, while core 
CPI inflation was around 2¼ percent.  The Michigan 
survey measure of median longer-run inflation expecta-
tions moved down in October to a new historical low, 
and the longer-run measure from the Blue Chip Eco-
nomic Indicators also declined slightly.  Measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations from the Desk’s Sur-
vey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partici-
pants were unchanged in October. 

Foreign real GDP growth appeared to pick up signifi-
cantly in the third quarter following weak growth in the 
second quarter that primarily reflected contractions in 
Canada and Mexico.  The recovery of oil production in 
Canada boosted economic activity there, and a pickup in 
U.S. economic activity and strong household spending 
in Mexico supported a sharp rebound in Mexican GDP 
growth.  The improvements in these economies more 
than offset some moderation of growth in China.  In the 
euro area and Japan, economic growth continued at a 
modest pace.  Inflation generally remained subdued in 
both the emerging market economies and the advanced 
foreign economies (AFEs).  A notable exception was the 
United Kingdom, where inflationary pressures in-
creased, partly as a result of a substantial depreciation of 
the pound in recent months. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial markets were relatively calm over the 
period since the September FOMC meeting.  Asset 
prices were little changed, and volatility was mostly low.  
Market expectations for an increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate before the end of the year rose 
modestly.  Nominal Treasury yields edged up on net.  No 
significant market disruptions were observed around the 
October 14 compliance deadline for MMF reform.  Fi-
nancing conditions for nonfinancial firms and house-
holds remained accommodative, on balance, and the 
credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to 
show signs of stabilization after having deteriorated in 
earlier quarters. 

Federal Reserve communications immediately following 
the September meeting, notably the Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections, were interpreted by market partici-
pants as slightly more accommodative than expected.  
Subsequent Federal Reserve communications and U.S. 
economic data releases over the intermeeting period 

Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2016 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

were generally interpreted as in line with market expec-
tations.  The expected path for the federal funds rate im-
plied by quotes on overnight index swap rates steepened 
slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Market-
based estimates of the probability of a rate increase be-
fore the end of the year rose modestly to about 65 per-
cent.  Consistent with market-based estimates, respond-
ents to the Desk’s November surveys of primary dealers 
and market participants on average assigned a probabil-
ity of about 60 percent to a rate increase by the end of 
this year.  Based on the median responses, the most likely 
path of the target federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018 
was little changed from that reported in the September 
surveys. 

Nominal Treasury yields edged up, on net, since the Sep-
tember FOMC meeting.  Yields declined early in the pe-
riod following the September FOMC communications 
and amid concerns about developments potentially af-
fecting profitability in the European banking sector, but 
they subsequently rose.  Although those market con-
cerns ebbed somewhat, they remained significant.  
Nominal yields were pushed up by an increase in infla-
tion compensation, which appeared attributable to a 
combination of factors, including the recent rise in oil 
prices and a decline in investors’ concerns about the risk 
of very low inflation outcomes, as implied by quotes on 
inflation caps and floors. 

Broad stock price indexes were little changed, on net, 
since the September FOMC meeting.  Realized and im-
plied volatility in equity markets remained relatively low.  
Spreads of yields on nonfinancial investment-grade and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds over those of compa-
rable-maturity Treasury securities declined a bit, with 
both spreads finishing the period at levels close to their 
medians during the economic expansions of the past two 
decades.  Based on available reports and analysts’ esti-
mates, aggregate corporate earnings per share appeared 
to continue to rebound in the third quarter, reflecting 
improvements across a wide range of industries, includ-
ing the energy sector. 

Foreign equity indexes broadly increased over the inter-
meeting period.  Nonetheless, foreign financial markets 
were sensitive to news about upcoming negotiations be-
tween the United Kingdom and the European Union 
(EU) over the U.K. exit from the EU as well as to ongo-
ing developments in the European banking sector.  Over 
the period, the dollar appreciated against most AFE cur-
rencies; the appreciation against the pound was particu-
larly pronounced, reflecting increased concerns that ne-
gotiations between U.K. and European officials would 

result in an outcome featuring less economic integration 
than anticipated earlier.  Concerns about U.K.–EU ne-
gotiations and higher U.K. inflation compensation also 
drove up 10-year gilt yields.  In contrast, the dollar de-
preciated against the currencies of most commodity-ex-
porting countries, including the Mexican peso and Rus-
sian ruble, consistent with the increase in oil prices. 

Money market reform continued to affect several short-
term funding markets in the weeks leading up to the Oc-
tober 14, 2016, compliance deadline, as investors con-
tinued to shift from prime funds to government funds.  
However, these flows slowed significantly in the days 
just before October 14 and remained subdued afterward.  
Measures of the liquidity of institutional prime funds, 
which had increased substantially ahead of the compli-
ance deadline, subsequently declined.  The rise in total 
assets of government funds over the intermeeting period 
appeared to contribute to moderately elevated take-up at 
the System’s ON RRP facility.  Overnight Eurodollar de-
posit volumes fell substantially in the weeks preceding 
the MMF reform compliance deadline and remained low 
as prime funds pulled back from lending in this market.  
Despite these volume changes, there was little effect on 
overnight money market rates, although the spread be-
tween the three-month London interbank offered rate 
and the overnight index swap rate remained elevated. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
generally accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate 
bonds was robust in September amid strong global de-
mand for bonds and low yields.  Growth of commercial 
and industrial (C&I) loans slowed overall in the third 
quarter but picked up in September.  Demand and lend-
ing standards for C&I loans remained unchanged, on 
net, in the third quarter, according to the October Senior 
Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac-
tices (SLOOS). 

The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations, which 
had deteriorated somewhat over the past few quarters, 
continued to show signs of stabilization.  The volume of 
bond downgrades only slightly outpaced that of up-
grades in September.  Default rates and expected year-
ahead default rates for nonfinancial firms both edged 
down, although they remained elevated compared with 
their ranges in recent years. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
also remained largely accommodative but showed some 
signs of tightening.  Growth of CRE loans on banks’ 
books continued to be strong in the third quarter, even 
though a significant number of banks reported in the 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

October SLOOS that they had tightened lending stand-
ards on CRE loans.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) picked up in the third quarter 
relative to its pace in the first half of the year.  Spreads 
on CMBS were little changed over the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

In the municipal bond market, gross issuance of bonds 
was brisk and yields on general obligation bonds, on bal-
ance, edged up.  The credit quality of state and local gov-
ernments was generally stable. 

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
were little changed since the September FOMC meeting, 
and credit remained readily available for most borrow-
ers.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edged 
up but stayed at a low level.  In the October SLOOS, 
several large banks noted a continued easing of stand-
ards for home-purchase loans eligible for purchase by 
the government-sponsored enterprises.  Indicators sug-
gested that refinancing activity continued to increase and 
reached its highest level since 2013 in response to the 
low level of mortgage rates. 

Conditions in consumer credit markets were little 
changed, on balance, against a backdrop of largely stable 
credit quality.  Growth in both revolving and nonrevolv-
ing loans remained robust.  While auto credit standards 
were broadly unchanged, respondents to the October 
SLOOS indicated that they had tightened credit card 
standards for subprime customers.  Yield spreads for se-
curities backed by credit card and auto loans over Treas-
ury securities of comparable maturities were little 
changed on balance.  Issuance of consumer asset-backed 
securities picked up somewhat in the third quarter from 
the levels seen earlier this year. 

In its latest report on potential risks to the stability of the 
U.S. financial system, the staff continued to judge that 
overall vulnerabilities remained moderate.  Vulnerabili-
ties associated with maturity and liquidity transformation 
appeared to have been reduced, reflecting the effects of 
newly implemented rules for prime MMFs.  Vulnerabil-
ities emanating from leverage in the financial sector re-
mained low, as the largest U.S. banks had strong regula-
tory capital and liquidity positions.  Valuation pressures 
across major asset categories remained at a moderate 
level:  Although some metrics for CRE transactions in-
dicated notable valuation pressures, CRE lending stand-
ards had tightened somewhat over the previous year, and 
valuations for domestic corporate equity and bonds 
were, on balance, in the middle of their historical ranges 
in relation to still-low Treasury yields.  Vulnerabilities 
from leverage in the private nonfinancial sector were 

seen as moderate overall, reflecting the combination of 
relatively high aggregate leverage in the corporate sector, 
a sharp slowdown in the expansion of the riskiest forms 
of corporate debt, and a continued modest rise in aggre-
gate household debt that accrued almost exclusively to 
borrowers with very high credit scores. 

Monetary policy announcements by foreign central 
banks had limited effects on asset prices.  At its Septem-
ber monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
announced that it will purchase Japanese government 
bonds (JGBs) to keep the yield on 10-year JGBs around 
zero; the BOJ also announced that it will continue to ex-
pand the monetary base until consumer price inflation 
exceeds the 2 percent target and stays above the target 
in a stable manner.  No further changes were announced 
following the BOJ’s October meeting.  The European 
Central Bank kept its policy stance unchanged at its Oc-
tober meeting while signaling that further changes to its 
asset purchase program could be announced at its next 
meeting. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the November FOMC meeting, the pace of real 
GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second 
half of this year than in the first half, as business invest-
ment was anticipated to turn up and the drag from in-
ventory investment was expected to end.  However, the 
forecast for the second half was lower than in the Sep-
tember projection, primarily reflecting softer-than-ex-
pected data on consumer spending.  The staff’s forecast 
for real GDP growth over the next couple of years was 
also slightly lower than in the previous projection, pri-
marily reflecting the effects of higher assumed paths for 
the dollar and for crude oil prices.  Nonetheless, the staff 
projected that real GDP would expand at a modestly 
faster pace than potential output in 2017 and 2018, sup-
ported by solid gains in consumer spending and, to a 
lesser degree, by pickups in both residential and business 
investment; in 2019, GDP was projected to expand at 
the same rate as its potential.  The unemployment rate 
was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 
2018 and then flatten out in 2019; the path for the un-
employment rate was a little higher than in the previous 
projection but was still projected to run below the staff’s 
estimate of its longer-run natural rate. 

The near-term forecast for consumer price inflation was 
somewhat higher than in the previous projection, re-
flecting incoming data on core prices and energy prices.  
Beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was gener-

ally little revised.  The staff continued to project that in-
flation would increase over the next several years, as 
food and energy prices along with the prices of non-en-
ergy imports were expected to begin rising steadily this 
year.  However, inflation was projected to be marginally 
below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 per-
cent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to 
the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that both 
monetary and fiscal policy appeared to be better posi-
tioned to offset large positive shocks than adverse ones.  
In addition, the staff continued to see the risks to the 
forecast from developments abroad as skewed to the 
downside.  Consistent with the downside risks to aggre-
gate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for 
the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks 
to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly bal-
anced.  The possibility that longer-term inflation expec-
tations may have edged down was roughly counterbal-
anced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this 
year could be more persistent than expected, particularly 
in an economy that was projected to continue operating 
above its long-run potential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that 
growth of economic activity had picked up from the 
modest pace seen in the first half of the year.  Job gains 
had been solid in recent months, although the unem-
ployment rate was little changed.  Household spending 
had been rising moderately, but business fixed invest-
ment had remained soft.  Inflation had increased some-
what since earlier this year but remained below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting 
earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-en-
ergy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
had changed little, on balance, in recent months.  Do-
mestic and global asset markets remained relatively calm 
over the intermeeting period, and U.S. financial condi-
tions continued to be broadly accommodative. 

Participants generally indicated that their economic fore-
casts had changed little over the intermeeting period.  

They continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  Infla-
tion was expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term, as the transitory effects of past declines in energy 
and import prices continued to dissipate and the labor 
market strengthened further.  A substantial majority 
viewed the near-term risks to the economic outlook as 
roughly balanced, although a few participants judged 
that significant downside risks remained, citing various 
factors including the low value of the neutral federal 
funds rate and its proximity to the effective lower bound, 
the possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in for-
eign economies, the continued uncertainty associated 
with the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, or finan-
cial fragilities in some countries.  Participants agreed that 
the Committee should continue to closely monitor infla-
tion indicators and global economic and financial devel-
opments. 

Participants noted that although real GDP growth in the 
third quarter was appreciably above the slow pace of the 
first half, it had been boosted in part by transitory fac-
tors, including a surge in agricultural exports and a 
bounceback in inventory investment.  Excluding these 
factors, underlying economic growth had been relatively 
modest:  Growth of consumer spending had slowed 
from its brisk pace earlier in the year, residential invest-
ment had fallen again, and business fixed investment had 
remained soft.  Retailers in a few Districts reported weak 
to moderate activity, although some contacts thought 
that holiday sales were likely to peak late in the season.  
Real economic activity was expected to advance at a 
moderate pace in coming quarters, primarily reflecting 
solid growth in consumer spending, consistent with on-
going employment gains, increases in household wealth, 
and low interest rates. 

Participants continued to expect economic activity in the 
coming quarters to be supported by a pickup in business 
investment.  Recent increases in oil and gas drilling ac-
tivity in response to higher energy prices were seen as a 
positive development for the investment outlook; how-
ever, a few participants reported that uncertainty about 
prospects for government policy, shorter investment 
time horizons for businesses, or the potential for ad-
vances in technology to disrupt existing business models 
were likely weighing on capital spending plans.  A few 
participants noted weakness in nonresidential construc-
tion.  District reports on residential construction activity 
were mixed.  One participant reported generally strong 
conditions in the District’s housing markets but also 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

cited various factors that were restraining residential 
construction in some locales, including constraints on 
builder financing, limitations on the supply of buildable 
lots, and shortages of skilled labor. 

In their discussion of business activity in their Districts, 
participants provided mixed reports on manufacturing, 
with a few areas that had been adversely affected by the 
downturn in energy prices reporting a modest pickup in 
output.  In the agricultural sector, low crop prices were 
said to continue to weigh on farm income and farm 
spending. 

Participants noted that economic growth in many for-
eign economies remained subdued, and that inflation 
rates abroad generally were still quite low.  Some partic-
ipants observed that important international downside 
risks remained, including constraints on monetary poli-
cies in the low interest rate environments of some coun-
tries; investors’ concerns about developments poten-
tially affecting profitability in the European banking sec-
tor; the possible consequences of upcoming negotiations 
and eventual terms of the United Kingdom’s exit from 
the EU; potential deleterious effects from rapid credit 
growth in China; and the potential for further dollar ap-
preciation, which could restrain U.S. inflation for a con-
siderable time. 

Participants generally agreed that labor market condi-
tions had continued to improve over the intermeeting 
period.  Reports from some Districts pointed to a tight-
ening in labor markets, evidenced by shortages of quali-
fied workers in some occupations, increases in overtime 
hours, or a pickup in wage inflation.  In several of these 
Districts, business contacts had undertaken workforce 
development and worker training to address a shortage 
of labor with the necessary skills. 

Many participants commented on the rise in the labor 
force participation rate since late 2015.  A few of them 
noted that the increase had largely reflected a diminution 
in the flow of individuals leaving the workforce rather 
than an increase of new entrants into the labor force and 
had been more prevalent among workers with relatively 
less education.  Participants expressed uncertainty about 
how long the participation rate could be expected to 
continue rising, particularly in light of the downward 
structural trend in this series.  On the one hand, the par-
ticipation rate for prime-age males remained significantly 
below its level before the financial crisis, suggesting that 
it could rise further over time.  In addition, there was 
some uncertainty around estimates of the longer-run 
trend rate of labor force participation and it could be 
higher than previously thought, reflecting, for example, 

a shift toward later retirement.  On the other hand, from 
a business cycle perspective, the increase in the partici-
pation rate in recent months was consistent with a tight-
ening labor market and an economy nearing full employ-
ment; furthermore, it was not clear that output growth 
above the economy’s potential growth rate would suc-
ceed in drawing new entrants permanently into the labor 
force.  Overall, while some participants expressed the 
view that the economy was close to or at full employ-
ment, several others judged that appreciable slack could 
remain in the labor market.  Some participants charac-
terized wage pressures as only moderate, although one 
noted that wage growth was similar to its pace at the 
peak of the previous economic expansion. 

Readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had 
come in somewhat higher than expected in recent 
months.  Participants generally regarded this as a positive 
development, consistent with headline inflation rising 
over the medium term to the Committee’s objective of 
2 percent.  A few participants observed that it was diffi-
cult to judge how much of the uptick in core PCE price 
inflation reflected transitory factors, while a couple of 
others saw the incoming data as suggesting that inflation 
could move up to the Committee’s objective more rap-
idly than previously expected.  Participants discussed 
possible policy implications of the risks surrounding the 
outlook for inflation, including the possibility that 
achieving the Committee’s inflation objective sooner 
than previously anticipated could cause a revision in 
market expectations of the path for policy rates and a 
sharp rise in longer-term interest rates, or the possibility 
that a further appreciation of the dollar stemming from 
developments abroad could renew disinflationary pres-
sures and postpone the need for policy firming.  Some 
participants regarded the uptick in market-based 
measures of inflation compensation over the intermeet-
ing period as a welcome suggestion of further progress 
toward the Committee’s inflation goal.  However, sev-
eral cautioned that these measures remained low or that 
the measures still appeared to embed a significant weight 
on undesirably low inflation outcomes.  The median ex-
pectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from 
the Michigan survey edged down in October to a new 
historical low, although it was noted that this drop could 
be explained by a reduction in the number of respon-
dents who had previously expected relatively high infla-
tion outcomes.  Overall, participants judged that survey-
based measures of inflation expectations had been fairly 
stable in recent months. 

Participants discussed a range of issues related to recent 
developments in financial markets and financial stability.  

Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2016 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

MMF reforms that became effective in mid-October had 
resulted in a substantial shift of assets out of prime funds 
and into government-only funds.  It was observed that 
these reforms had contributed to a sizable reduction of 
risk in the shadow banking system.  Participants also dis-
cussed some causes of the low yields on longer-term 
Treasury securities and their embedded term premiums, 
which were below historical average levels.  Among the 
factors cited were a persistent decline in the neutral fed-
eral funds rate, and depressed term premiums likely ow-
ing to the elevated size of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet as well as the reduced likelihood of high inflation 
relative to several decades ago.  Some of these factors 
could endure for some time. 

In connection with the participants’ discussion of the 
long-run monetary policy implementation framework, 
many participants noted that the Committee’s broader 
monetary policy strategy needed both to be considered 
in conjunction with the design of such a framework and 
to receive careful further consideration in its own right.  
In particular, accumulating evidence of slow trend 
productivity and output growth and associated persis-
tently low levels of neutral interest rates, both in the 
United States and abroad, had potential implications for 
the most effective policy implementation framework for 
the Federal Reserve in coming years as well as the mon-
etary policy strategy that would best promote the Com-
mittee’s macroeconomic objectives.  Among other fac-
tors that needed to be taken into account, it was ob-
served that neutral real short-term interest rates could 
decline further if central bank balance sheets contracted 
or the positive effects of quantitative easing on eco-
nomic activity waned over time.  Participants agreed that 
issues associated with monetary policy implementation 
should be discussed within the context of the current 
and potential future economic and financial environ-
ment and the Committee’s strategy for monetary policy. 

Against the backdrop of their views of the economic 
outlook, participants discussed whether the available in-
formation warranted taking another step to reduce pol-
icy accommodation at this meeting.  Based on the rela-
tively limited information received since the September 
FOMC meeting, participants generally agreed that the 
case for increasing the target range for the federal funds 
rate had continued to strengthen.  Participants saw re-
cent information as indicating that labor market condi-
tions had improved further and considered the firming 
in inflation and inflation compensation to be positive de-
velopments, consistent with continued progress toward 
the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  How-
ever, a number of participants expressed the view that 

some modest slack remained in the labor market or 
noted that readings on inflation compensation and infla-
tion expectations remained low.  Moreover, some par-
ticipants suggested that current conditions did not point 
to an immediate need to tighten policy or that some fur-
ther evidence of continued progress toward the Com-
mittee’s objectives would provide greater support for 
policy firming.   

Most participants expressed a view that it could well be-
come appropriate to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate relatively soon, so long as incoming data pro-
vided some further evidence of continued progress to-
ward the Committee’s objectives.  Some participants 
noted that recent Committee communications were con-
sistent with an increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate in the near term or argued that to preserve 
credibility, such an increase should occur at the next 
meeting.  A few participants advocated an increase at this 
meeting; they viewed recent economic developments as 
indicating that labor market conditions were at or close 
to those consistent with maximum employment and ex-
pected that recent progress toward the Committee’s in-
flation objective would continue, even with further grad-
ual steps to remove monetary policy accommodation.  In 
addition, many judged that risks to economic and finan-
cial stability could increase over time if the labor market 
overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an ex-
tended period of low interest rates risked intensifying in-
centives for investors to reach for yield, potentially lead-
ing to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital.  
In contrast, some others judged that allowing the unem-
ployment rate to fall below its longer-run normal level 
for a time could result in favorable supply-side effects or 
help hasten the return of inflation to the Committee’s 
2 percent objective; noted that proximity of the federal 
funds rate to the effective lower bound places potential 
constraints on monetary policy; or stressed that global 
developments could pose risks to U.S. economic activ-
ity.  More generally, it was emphasized that decisions re-
garding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary 
policy would appropriately remain dependent on the 
outlook as informed by incoming data, and participants 
expected that economic conditions would evolve in a 
manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in September indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that 
growth of economic activity had picked up from the 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

modest pace seen in the first half of this year.  Although 
the unemployment rate was little changed in recent 
months, job gains had been solid.  Household spending 
had been rising moderately but business fixed invest-
ment had remained soft.  Inflation had increased some-
what since earlier this year but was still below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting 
earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-en-
ergy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
were little changed, on balance, in recent months. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market conditions would strengthen 
somewhat further.  Almost all of them continued to 
judge that near-term risks to the economic outlook were 
roughly balanced.  Members generally observed that la-
bor market conditions had improved appreciably over 
the past year, a development that was particularly evident 
in the solid pace of monthly payroll employment gains 
and the increase in the labor force participation rate.  It 
was noted that allowing the unemployment rate to mod-
estly undershoot its longer-run normal level could foster 
the return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent objec-
tive over the medium term.  A few members, however, 
were concerned that a sizable undershooting of the 
longer-run normal unemployment rate could necessitate 
a steep subsequent rise in policy rates, undermining the 
Committee’s prior communications about its expecta-
tions for a gradually rising policy rate or even posing 
risks to the economic expansion. 

Members continued to expect inflation to remain low in 
the near term, but most anticipated that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation 
would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over 
the medium term.  Some members observed that the in-
creases in inflation and inflation compensation in recent 
months were welcome, although a couple of them noted 
that inflation was still running below the Committee’s 
objective.  Against this backdrop and in light of the cur-
rent shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, members 
agreed that they would continue to carefully monitor ac-
tual and expected progress toward the Committee’s in-
flation goal. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that 
outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target 

range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this 
meeting.  Members generally agreed that the case for an 
increase in the policy rate had continued to strengthen.  
But a majority of members judged that the Committee 
should, for the time being, await some further evidence 
of progress toward its objectives of maximum employ-
ment and 2 percent inflation before increasing the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  A few members empha-
sized that a cautious approach to removing accommo-
dation was warranted given the proximity of policy rates 
to the effective lower bound, as the Committee had 
more scope to increase policy rates, if necessary, than to 
reduce them.  Two members preferred to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this 
meeting.  They saw inflation as close to the 2 percent 
objective and viewed an increase in the federal funds rate 
as appropriate at this meeting because they judged that 
the economy was essentially at maximum employment 
and that monetary policy was unable to contribute to a 
permanent further improvement in labor market condi-
tions in these circumstances.   

The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its objectives of maxi-
mum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-
ment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  The Committee expected that economic con-
ditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that 
the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the 
longer run.  However, members emphasized that the ac-
tual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the 
economic outlook as informed by incoming data.   

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  Members noted 
that this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank

of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective November 3, 2016, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in September indicates 
that the labor market has continued to 
strengthen and growth of economic activity has 
picked up from the modest pace seen in the first 
half of this year.  Although the unemployment 
rate is little changed in recent months, job gains 
have been solid.  Household spending has been 
rising moderately but business fixed investment 
has remained soft.  Inflation has increased 
somewhat since earlier this year but is still below 
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, 
partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices 
and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation have 
moved up but remain low; most survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
are little changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 
with gradual adjustments in the stance of mon-
etary policy, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market conditions will 
strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation is ex-
pected to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term as the transitory effects of past declines in 
energy and import prices dissipate and the labor 
market strengthens further.  Near-term risks to 
the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  
The Committee continues to closely monitor 
inflation indicators and global economic and fi-
nancial developments. 

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The Committee 
judges that the case for an increase in the federal 
funds rate has continued to strengthen but de-
cided, for the time being, to wait for some fur-
ther evidence of continued progress toward its 
objectives.  The stance of monetary policy re-
mains accommodative, thereby supporting fur-
ther improvement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  In light of the current shortfall of 
inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress 
toward its inflation goal.  The Committee ex-
pects that economic conditions will evolve in a 
manner that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate 
is likely to remain, for some time, below levels 
that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the federal funds 
rate will depend on the economic outlook as in-
formed by incoming data.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer, 
Jerome H. Powell, Eric Rosengren, and Daniel K. Ta-
rullo. 

Voting against this action:  Esther L. George and 
Loretta J. Mester. 

Mses. George and Mester dissented because they pre-
ferred to increase the target range for the federal funds 
rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. 

Ms. George judged that, with the labor market near full 
employment and inflation approaching the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, another step in the gradual adjust-
ment of monetary policy was appropriate.  While a low 
level of the target range for the federal funds rate had 
supported achieving the Committee’s objectives, such 
low levels were no longer warranted and, if maintained, 
could pose a risk to the sustainability of the economic 
expansion with stable inflation.  In particular, she viewed 
the supply-side benefits of allowing labor utilization to 
rise above its neutral level as temporary, and noted that 
monetary policy was unable to affect the longer-run 
growth potential of the economy. 

Ms. Mester judged that the economy was essentially at 
full employment in terms of what can be achieved 
through monetary policy.  The unemployment rate was 
at her estimate of its longer-run normal level, and labor 
market conditions were projected to tighten further.  In 
addition, she noted that inflation was moving up and was 
close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  In these 
circumstances, she believed it appropriate to gradually 
increase the target range for the federal funds rate from 
its current low level, which would allow monetary policy 
to continue to lend support to the economic expansion.  
A gradual path would allow the Committee to better cal-
ibrate policy over time as it learns more about the under-
lying structural aspects of the economy.  Ms. Mester saw 
taking the next step in removing policy accommodation 
as consistent with the Committee’s communications 
about the appropriate path for monetary policy. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors took no action to change the inter-
est rates on reserves or discount rates. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 13–
14, 2016.  The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on No-
vember 2, 2016.  

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on October 11, 2016, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on September 20–21, 2016.
