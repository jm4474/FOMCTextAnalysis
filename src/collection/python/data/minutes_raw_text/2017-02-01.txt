tem Open Market Account (SOMA).  

By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Simon Pot-
ter and Lorie K. Logan to serve at the pleasure of the

Secretary’s note:  Advice subsequently was re-
ceived that the manager and deputy manager 
selections indicated above were satisfactory to 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to reaffirm 
without change the Authorization for Domestic Open 
Market Operations, the Authorization for Foreign Cur-
rency Operations, and the Foreign Currency Directive as 
shown below.  The Guidelines for the Conduct of Sys-
tem Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues 
remained suspended. 

 
AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN 
MARKET OPERATIONS  
(As reaffirmed effective January 31, 2017) 

1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to 
carry out the most recent domestic policy directive 
adopted  by the Committee: 

A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that 
are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin-
cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities 
that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by, any agency of the United 
States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu-
rities”) for the System Open Market Account 
(“SOMA”): 

i. As an outright operation with securities dealers 
and foreign and international accounts maintained 

at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de-
livery basis (including such transactions as are com-
monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) 
at market prices; or 
ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or 
deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se-
curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo 
transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub-
ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo 
transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, 
at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the 
Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, 
after applying reasonable limitations on the volume 
of agreements with individual counterparties; 

B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma-
ture without replacement;  
C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection 
with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in 
the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible 
Securities that are direct obligations of the United 
States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the United States; and 
D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible 
Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United 
States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct 
obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed 
as to principal and interest by that agency. 

2. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graph 1 from time to time for the purpose of testing op-
erational readiness, subject to the following limitations: 

A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 2 
shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-
tee; 
B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au-
thorized in this paragraph 2 that are of the type de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.i shall not exceed $5 billion 
per calendar year; and 
C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.ii shall not exceed $5 billion 
at any given time. 

3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se-
lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu-
rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis 
(except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi-
ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). 

A. Such securities lending must be: 
i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; 
ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the 
objectives of the program; 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total 
amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that 
may be auctioned; and 
iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the 
amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower 
may borrow. 

B. The Selected Bank may: 
i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis-
cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a 
single issue;  
ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral 
for any loan of securities authorized in this para-
graph 3; and 
iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a 
loan of agency securities authorized in this para-
graph 3. 

4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, while assisting in the provision of 
short-term investments or other authorized services for 
foreign central bank and international accounts main-
tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac-
counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec-
tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the 
Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com-
mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on 
terms comparable to those available in the open market:  

A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake 
reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in 
the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 
65 business days or less; and 
B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus-
tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, 
when appropriate and subject to all other necessary 
authorization and approvals, to:  

i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi-
ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo 
transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus-
tomer Accounts; and  
ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi-
ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. 

Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un-
der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a 
service fee when appropriate.  Transactions undertaken 
with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori-
zation or approval of other entities, including the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when 
involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United 
States Department of the Treasury. 

5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the 
Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur-
ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to 
instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com-
mittee to: 

A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances 
the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that 
may result in material changes in the composition and 
size of the assets in the SOMA; or  
B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible 
Securities in order to appropriately address temporary 
disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature 
in U.S. dollar funding markets. 

Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of 
this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the 
Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of 
policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s 
long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and 
price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, 
and monetary developments since the most recent meet-
ing of the Committee.  The Chairman, whenever feasi-
ble, will consult with the Committee before making any 
instruction under this paragraph 5.

forward transactions in foreign currencies:  

A. Approval of such operation is required as fol-
lows:

in advance to execute the operation if it would result 
in the overall volume of standalone spot and for-
ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined 
in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding 
$5 billion since the close of the most recent regular 
meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency 
Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct 
the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera-
tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation 
with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail-
able.  
ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee 
to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the 
operation if it would result in the overall volume of 
standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign

tee.

market conditions; or

of probable future needs for currencies; or

in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard-
ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur-
rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the 
transaction. 

 
WAREHOUSING 
 
4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with 
the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re-
quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap 
transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza-
tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve 
Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected 
Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected 
Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known 
as warehousing).  
 
RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, 
AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN 
CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 
 
5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established 
under the North American Framework Agreement, 
standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand-
ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro-
vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary 
to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com-
mittee.

dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing for-
eign currency liquidity swap arrangements:

OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN 
CURRENCIES

nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent 
necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of 
the Committee. 

A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of

rency holdings by:

guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign 
government or agency thereof (“Permitted Foreign

ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under 
agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For-
eign Securities and selling such securities under 
agreements for the resale of such securities; and 
iii. Managing balances in various time and other 
deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by 
the Board of Governors under Regulation N.  

C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the 
Committee, may provide additional instructions to the 
Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren-
cies.

________________________ 
1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of 
the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and 
other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements 
and to promote a stable system of exchange rates.  These 
obligations include seeking to direct the member’s eco-
nomic and financial policies toward the objective of fos-
tering orderly economic growth with reasonable price 
stability.  These obligations also include avoiding manip-
ulating exchange rates or the international monetary sys-
tem in such a way that would impede effective balance 
of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive 
advantage over other members. 

 

FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE  
(As reaffirmed effective January 31, 2017) 

1. The Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to ex-
ecute open market transactions, for the System Open 
Market Account, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the 
“Authorization”) and subject to the limits in this Di-
rective. 
2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to exe-
cute warehousing transactions, if so requested by the

zation.

Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017 Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

(1) minor changes that provide some additional flexibil-
ity in the classification of FOMC information and (2) the 
removal of language concerning communication with 
the Treasury Department regarding SOMA foreign cur-
rency operations that was no longer necessary in the Pro-
gram because similar language was inserted into the Au-
thorization for Foreign Currency Operations in Septem-
ber 2016. 

In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State-
ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat-
egy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was 
required at this meeting, which was to update the refer-
ence to participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment from 4.9 percent to 4.8 percent.  
All participants supported the statement with the revi-
sion, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve 
the updated statement.

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY 
(As amended effective January 31, 2017) 

“The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is 
firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from 
the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta-
ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The 
Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci-
sions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity 
facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households 
and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer-
tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, 
and enhances transparency and accountability, which are 
essential in a democratic society.  

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates 
fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan-
cial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions 
tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  
Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions reflect its 
longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as-
sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the 
financial system that could impede the attainment of the 
Committee’s goals.  

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de-
termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee 
has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  
The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at 
the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change 
in the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the 
Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.  The Committee 

would be concerned if inflation were running persis-
tently above or below this objective.  Communicating 
this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps 
keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, 
thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term 
interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to 
promote maximum employment in the face of signifi-
cant economic disturbances.  The maximum level of em-
ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors 
that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar-
ket.  These factors may change over time and may not 
be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be 
appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; ra-
ther, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed 
by assessments of the maximum level of employment, 
recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer-
tain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a 
wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  
Information about Committee participants’ estimates of 
the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem-
ployment is published four times per year in the 
FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.  For ex-
ample, in the most recent projections, the median of 
FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment was 4.8 percent.  

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to 
mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal 
and deviations of employment from the Committee’s as-
sessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are 
generally complementary.  However, under circum-
stances in which the Committee judges that the objec-
tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap-
proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag-
nitude of the deviations and the potentially different 
time horizons over which employment and inflation are 
projected to return to levels judged consistent with its 
mandate. 

The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles 
and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual or-
ganizational meeting each January.” 

 
The Committee considered amendments to its Policy on 
External Communications of Committee Participants 
and its Policy on External Communications of Federal 
Reserve System Staff.  The amendments consisted of (1) 
starting the communication blackout earlier (the second 
Saturday before Committee meetings); (2) revising the 
treatment of staff presentations during the blackout pe-
riod; (3) revising provisions regarding regularly pub-
lished System releases of data, survey results, statistical

indexes, and model results during the blackout period; 
(4) explicitly recognizing the need for ongoing commu-
nications with the public by staff members during the 
blackout period for operational or information- 
gathering purposes; and (5) making several miscellane-
ous changes, generally to improve clarity. 

All participants supported the revisions, and the Com-
mittee voted unanimously to approve the revised poli-
cies. 

Illustration of Uncertainty in the Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections 
Participants considered a revised proposal from the sub-
committee on communications to add to the Summary 
of Economic Projections (SEP) a number of charts 
(sometimes called fan charts) that would illustrate the 
uncertainty that attends participants’ macroeconomic 
projections.  The revised proposal was based on further 
analysis and consultations following Committee discus-
sion of a proposal at the January 2016 meeting.  Partici-
pants generally supported the revised approach and 
agreed that fan charts would be incorporated in the SEP 
to be released with the minutes of the March 14–15, 
2017, FOMC meeting.  The Chair noted that a staff pa-
per on measures of forecast uncertainty in the SEP, in-
cluding those that would be used as the basis for fan 
charts in the SEP, would be made available to the public 
soon after the minutes of the current meeting were pub-
lished, and that examples of the new charts using previ-
ously published data would be released in advance of the 
March meeting. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The SOMA manager reported on developments in U.S. 
and global financial markets during the period since the 
Committee met on December 13–14, 2016.  Financial 
asset prices were little changed since the December 
meeting.  Market participants continued to report sub-
stantial uncertainty about potential changes in fiscal, reg-
ulatory, and other government policies.  Nonetheless, 
measures of implied volatility of various asset prices re-
mained low.  Emerging market currencies were generally 
resilient in recent weeks, reportedly benefiting from in-
vestors’ anticipation of stronger global economic 
growth, after depreciating significantly against the dollar 
during the previous intermeeting period.  Market expec-
tations for the path of the federal funds rate were little 
changed over the intermeeting period. 

The deputy manager followed with a briefing on devel-
opments in money markets, market expectations for the 
System’s balance sheet, and open market operations.  In 

money markets, interest rates smoothly shifted higher 
following the Committee’s decision at its December 
meeting to increase the target range for the federal funds 
rate by 25 basis points, and federal funds subsequently 
traded near the center of the new range except on year-
end.  Although year-end pressures in U.S. money mar-
kets were similar to past quarter-ends, some notable, al-
beit temporary, strains appeared over the turn of the year 
in foreign exchange swap markets and European mar-
kets for repurchase agreements.  The Open Market 
Desk’s surveys of dealers and market participants 
pointed to some change in expectations for FOMC re-
investment policy, with more respondents than in previ-
ous surveys anticipating a change in policy when the fed-
eral funds rate reaches 1 to 1½ percent.  The higher level 
of take-up at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement facility that developed following the imple-
mentation of money market fund reform last fall gener-
ally persisted.  The staff also briefed the Committee on 
plans for small-value tests of various System operations 
and facilities during 2017 and for quarterly tests of the 
Term Deposit Facility. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the January 31–Febru-
ary 1 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product 
(GDP) expanded at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter 
of last year and that labor market conditions continued 
to strengthen.  Consumer price inflation rose further 
above the slow pace seen during the first half of last year, 
but it was still running below the Committee’s longer-
run objective of 2 percent. 

Recent indicators generally showed that labor market 
conditions continued to improve in late 2016.  Total 
nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in 
December.  The unemployment rate edged up to 
4.7 percent but remained near its recent low, while the 
labor force participation rate rose slightly.  The share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons de-
creased further.  The rates of private-sector job openings 
and of hiring were unchanged in November, while the 
rate of quits edged up.  The four-week moving average 
of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits 
was still low in December and early January.  Measures 
of labor compensation continued to rise at a moderate 
rate.  The employment cost index for private industry

workers rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in 
December, and average hourly earnings for all employ-
ees increased almost 3 percent over the same 12-month 
period.  The unemployment rates for African Ameri-
cans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the lev-
els seen just before the most recent recession, but the 
unemployment rates for African Americans and for His-
panics remained above the rate for whites. 

Total industrial production edged down in the fourth 
quarter as a whole.  Mining output expanded markedly, 
but manufacturing production advanced only modestly.  
The output of utilities declined, as the weather was un-
seasonably warm, on average, during the fourth quarter.  
Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that motor 
vehicle production would be a little lower early this year, 
but broader indicators of manufacturing production, 
such as the new orders indexes from national and re-
gional manufacturing surveys, were consistent with 
modest gains in factory output in the near term. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at 
a moderate pace in the fourth quarter.  Consumer ex-
penditures for durable goods, particularly motor vehi-
cles, increased considerably.  However, consumer 
spending for energy services declined markedly, reflect-
ing unseasonably warm weather.  Recent readings on 
some key factors that influence consumer spending—
including further gains in employment, real disposable 
personal income, and households’ net worth—were 
consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 
2017.  In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, 
moved up to an elevated level in December and January. 

Real residential investment spending rose at a brisk pace 
in the fourth quarter after decreasing in the previous two 
quarters.  Building permit issuance for new single-family 
homes—which tends to be a reliable indicator of the un-
derlying trend in construction—advanced solidly.  Sales 
of existing homes increased modestly in the fourth quar-
ter, although new home sales declined. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property (E&I) expanded at a moderate pace 
in the fourth quarter after declining, on net, over the pre-
ceding three quarters.  Recent increases in nominal new 
orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, 
along with improvements in indicators of business sen-
timent, pointed to further moderate increases in real 
E&I spending in the near term.  Real business expendi-
tures for nonresidential structures declined in the fourth 
quarter after rising in the previous quarter.  The number 
of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation, an indicator 

of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sec-
tor, continued to increase through late January.  The 
change in real inventory investment was estimated to 
have made an appreciable positive contribution to real 
GDP growth in the fourth quarter. 

Real total government purchases rose somewhat in the 
fourth quarter.  Federal government purchases for de-
fense decreased while nondefense expenditures in-
creased.  State and local government purchases increased 
modestly, as the payrolls of these governments ex-
panded slightly and their construction spending ad-
vanced somewhat. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in Novem-
ber for the second consecutive month.  After declining 
in October, nominal exports fell again in November as 
decreases in exports of capital goods more than offset 
increases in exports of industrial supplies.  Nominal im-
ports in November rose to their highest level of the year, 
led by imports of industrial supplies and materials.  The 
Census Bureau’s advance trade estimates for December 
suggested a narrowing of the trade deficit in goods, as 
imports increased less than exports.  Altogether, the 
change in real net exports was estimated to have made a 
substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in 
the fourth quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased a little more than 1½ percent over 
the 12 months ending in December, partly restrained by 
decreases in consumer food prices last year.  Core PCE 
price inflation, which excludes changes in food and en-
ergy prices, was 1¾ percent over those same 12 months, 
held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-
energy imports over part of this period.  Over the same 
12-month period, total consumer prices as measured by 
the consumer price index (CPI) rose a bit more than 
2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 2¼ percent.   
Survey-based measures of median longer-run inflation 
expectations—such as those from the Michigan survey 
and from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Sur-
vey of Market Participants—were unchanged, on net, 
over December and January. 

Foreign real GDP growth appeared to slow somewhat 
in the fourth quarter from its relatively strong third-
quarter pace.  Nevertheless, recent data on foreign in-
dustrial production and trade seemed to be stronger than 
private analysts had anticipated and were consistent with 
moderate economic growth abroad.  Economic growth 
in both the euro area and the United Kingdom contin-
ued at relatively solid rates.  In the emerging market 
economies (EMEs), GDP growth remained robust in 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

China but slowed elsewhere in the Asian EMEs and in 
Mexico, while the pace of economic contraction ap-
peared to lessen in South America.  Inflation in the ad-
vanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, 
largely reflecting the pass-through of earlier increases in 
crude oil prices into retail energy prices.  Inflation also 
rose in many EMEs, in part because of rising food and 
fuel prices; however, inflation fell notably in much of 
South America. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial conditions were mostly little 
changed, on balance, since the December FOMC meet-
ing.  Broad equity price indexes fluctuated in a relatively 
narrow range and ended the intermeeting period about 
unchanged.  Nominal Treasury yields moved up across 
most maturities in the days following the December 
FOMC meeting but subsequently reversed and ended 
the period little changed on net.  Measures of inflation 
compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected 
Securities (TIPS) rose somewhat on balance.  Amid no-
table volatility, the broad dollar index declined slightly 
on net.  Meanwhile, financing conditions for nonfinan-
cial businesses and households remained generally ac-
commodative. 

Although the FOMC’s decision to raise the target range 
for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent at the De-
cember meeting was widely anticipated in financial mar-
kets, contacts generally characterized some of the com-
munications associated with the FOMC meeting as less 
accommodative than expected.  In particular, market 
commentaries highlighted the upward revision of 25 ba-
sis points to the median projection for the federal funds 
rate at the end of 2017 in the SEP.  Nonetheless, the 
expected path of the federal funds rate implied by fu-
tures quotes was little changed, on net, since the Decem-
ber meeting.  Market-based estimates indicated that in-
vestors saw the probability of an increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the January 31– 
February 1 FOMC meeting as very low, and the esti-
mated probability of an increase in the target range at or 
before the March meeting was about 25 percent.  Con-
sistent with readings based on market quotes, results 
from the Desk’s January Survey of Primary Dealers and 
Survey of Market Participants indicated that the median 
respondent assigned a probability of about 25 percent to 
the next increase in the target range occurring at or be-
fore the March FOMC meeting.  Market-based estimates 
of the probability of an increase in the target range at or 
before the June meeting were about 70 percent. 

Yields on nominal Treasury securities increased across 
most maturities following the December FOMC meet-
ing, but they fell, on balance, over the remainder of the 
intermeeting period.  While market commentary sug-
gested that a number of factors contributed to the de-
cline, a clear catalyst was difficult to identify.  Treasury 
yields ended the period about unchanged and remained 
significantly higher than just before the U.S. elections in 
November.  TIPS-based measures of inflation compen-
sation edged up over the intermeeting period. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes fluctuated in a relatively 
narrow range and were little changed, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  However, equity prices remained 
notably higher than just before the November elections, 
apparently reflecting investors’ expectations that fiscal 
and other policy changes would boost corporate profits 
and economic activity in the medium term.  Implied vol-
atility on the S&P 500 index edged down since the De-
cember meeting and remained relatively low.  Corporate 
bond spreads for both investment- and speculative-
grade firms continued to narrow over the intermeeting 
period and were near the bottom of their ranges of the 
past several years. 

Money market rates responded as expected to the 
change in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The 
effective federal funds rate was 66 basis points—25 basis 
points higher than previously—every day following the 
change, except at year-end.  Conditions in other domes-
tic short-term funding markets were generally stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Assets under management 
by money market funds changed little, with government 
funds experiencing modest net outflows and prime fund 
assets remaining about flat. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses contin-
ued to be accommodative overall.  Corporate bond issu-
ance by nonfinancial firms rebounded in December to 
about its robust average pace of the past few years, and 
issuance of syndicated leveraged loans was strong.  
Gross equity issuance was solid in November and De-
cember.  Meanwhile, after a slowdown in the third quar-
ter, the growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans 
on banks’ books picked up in the fourth quarter, al-
though the pace remained slower than earlier in the year.  
The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on 
Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks 
left C&I lending standards for large and middle-market 
firms and for small firms unchanged, on balance, in the 
fourth quarter.  On net, banks expected to ease their 
standards for C&I loans somewhat in 2017. 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017 Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

Credit continued to be broadly available in the commer-
cial real estate (CRE) sector, although results from the 
January SLOOS indicated that banks continued to 
tighten their lending standards in the fourth quarter and 
expected to tighten them somewhat further in 2017.  
CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets continued to grow 
in the fourth quarter, although at a somewhat slower rate 
than earlier in the year, while issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was solid over the 
period, in part because issuers tried to complete deals 
before the implementation of new risk retention rules in 
late December.  The delinquency rate on CMBS moved 
up further in November and December; the increase 
largely reflected delinquencies on loans originated before 
the financial crisis. 

Credit conditions for residential mortgages were little 
changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Mortgage 
credit was broadly available to households with average 
to high credit scores, while credit remained tight for bor-
rowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document in-
come, or high debt-to-income ratios.  According to the 
January SLOOS, banks reportedly left lending standards 
unchanged, on net, on most categories of home- 
purchase loans.  The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages moved about in line with rates on  
comparable-maturity Treasury securities, rising notably 
after the November elections but retracing part of that 
increase since mid-December.  The pace of purchase 
originations was little changed in recent months despite 
higher mortgage rates, while refinance originations fell 
sharply.  Bank lending for residential mortgages was 
solid in the fourth quarter, and the issuance of mortgage-
backed securities was robust. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally accommodative, although lending 
standards for credit cards continued to be tight for sub-
prime borrowers.  Respondents to the January SLOOS 
indicated that, over the previous three months, they had 
tightened standards and terms on auto and credit card 
loans, and that they expected to tighten standards further 
in 2017.  Consumer loan balances increased at a robust 
rate through November, with credit card loans, student 
loans, and auto loans all expanding at a similar pace.  
Measures of consumer credit quality were little changed, 
on net, in the fourth quarter. 

Foreign economic data that were better than expected 
and perceptions of an ebbing of some potential down-
side risks in Europe appeared to contribute to an im-
provement in investor sentiment in global financial mar-

kets.  Importantly, a large euro-area bank reached a set-
tlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on issues 
related to mortgage-backed securities, and the Italian 
government approved a funding package and other 
measures to support struggling banks.  Reflecting the im-
proved sentiment and positive economic news, global 
equity prices and longer-term sovereign yields in most 
AFEs increased moderately over the period.  Yield 
spreads on EME sovereign bonds narrowed somewhat, 
and flows into EME mutual funds turned positive.  The 
broad dollar index increased immediately after the De-
cember FOMC meeting but subsequently retraced its 
gains and ended the period slightly lower.  In contrast, 
the dollar strengthened further against the Mexican peso 
over the intermeeting period. 

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability, indicating that it continued to judge 
the vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moder-
ate on balance.  The staff’s assessment took into account 
the increase in asset valuation pressures since the No-
vember elections, the overall low level of financial lever-
age, the strong capital positions at banks, and the sub-
dued growth of debt among households and businesses.  
In addition, with money market fund reforms in place, 
the vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transfor-
mation were viewed as being somewhat below their 
longer-run average. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for this FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast was little 
changed from the December meeting.  Real GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated 
to have been a little faster than the staff had expected in 
December, and the pace of economic growth in the first 
half of this year was projected to be essentially the same 
as in the fourth quarter.  The staff’s forecast for real 
GDP growth over the next several years was little 
changed.  The staff continued to project that real GDP 
would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential 
output in 2017 through 2019.  The unemployment rate 
was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 
2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer-
run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was 
little changed from the previous projection. 

The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation was un-
changed on balance.  The staff continued to project that 
inflation would increase over the next several years, as 
food and energy prices, along with the prices of non-
energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising ei-
ther this year or next.  However, inflation was projected 

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 

 

to be marginally below the Committee’s longer-run ob-
jective of 2 percent in 2019. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to 
the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment 
that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to 
offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse 
ones.  However, the staff viewed the risks to the forecast 
from developments abroad as less pronounced than in 
the recent past.  Consistent with the downside risks to 
aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its out-
look for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  
The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as 
roughly balanced.  The downside risks from the possi-
bility that longer-term inflation expectations may have 
edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substan-
tially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by 
the upside risk that inflation could increase more than 
expected in an economy that was projected to continue 
operating above its longer-run potential. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the 
labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had continued to expand at a moderate 
pace.  Job gains had remained solid, and the unemploy-
ment rate had stayed near its recent low.  Household 
spending had continued to rise moderately, while busi-
ness fixed investment had remained soft.  Measures of 
consumer and business sentiment had improved of late.  
Inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still 
below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation re-
mained low; most survey-based measures of inflation 
compensation were little changed on balance. 

Participants generally indicated that their economic fore-
casts had changed little since the December FOMC 
meeting.  They continued to anticipate that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic 
activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market 
conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and in-
flation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  
They also judged that near-term risks to the economic 
outlook appeared roughly balanced.  Participants again 
emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the 
prospects for changes in fiscal and other government 

policies as well as about the timing and magnitude of the 
net effects of such changes on economic activity.  In dis-
cussing the risks to the economic outlook, participants 
continued to view the possibility of more expansionary 
fiscal policy as having increased the upside risks to their 
economic forecasts, although some noted that several 
potential changes in government policies could pose 
downside risks.  In addition, several viewed the down-
side risks from weaker economic activity abroad as hav-
ing diminished somewhat.  But several indicated that 
they continued to be concerned about the downside 
risks to economic activity associated with the possibility 
of additional appreciation of the foreign exchange value 
of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign 
economies, together with the proximity of the federal 
funds rate to the effective lower bound.  Regarding the 
outlook for inflation, some participants continued to be 
concerned that faster-than-expected economic growth 
or a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal 
unemployment rate posed upside risks to inflation.  
However, several others continued to see downside risks 
to the inflation outlook, citing still-low measures of in-
flation compensation and inflation expectations or the 
possibility of further appreciation of the dollar.  Partici-
pants generally agreed that the Committee should con-
tinue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global 
economic and financial developments. 

Regarding the household sector, consumer spending 
posted a moderate increase in the fourth quarter, and 
participants generally anticipated that further gains in 
consumer spending would contribute importantly to 
economic growth in 2017.  They expected that, although 
interest rates had moved higher, household spending 
would continue to be supported by rising employment 
and income as well as high levels of household wealth.  
The recent improvement in consumer sentiment was 
also viewed as a potentially positive factor in the outlook 
for spending, although several participants cautioned 
that an elevated level of sentiment, even if it was sus-
tained, was likely to make only a small contribution to 
household spending beyond those from income, wealth, 
and credit conditions. 

Recent indicators of activity in the housing sector were 
generally positive.  Starts and permits for single-family 
housing and sales of existing homes rose moderately in 
the fourth quarter, and real residential investment 
bounced back after two quarterly declines.  A couple of 
participants commented that supply constraints might 
be holding back new homebuilding.  In addition, a few 
participants noted that prospects for residential invest-

ment would also depend on whether household for-
mation picked up and how housing market activity re-
sponded to the recent rise in mortgage interest rates. 

The outlook for the business sector improved further 
over the intermeeting period.  Business investment in 
E&I, which had been contracting earlier in 2016, in-
creased at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter.  In ad-
dition, new orders for nondefense capital goods posted 
widespread gains in recent months.  The available re-
ports from District surveys of activity and revenues in 
the manufacturing and services industries were very pos-
itive.  Moreover, a number of national surveys of senti-
ment among corporate executives and small business 
owners as well as information from participants’ District 
contacts indicated a high level of optimism about the 
economic outlook.  Many participants indicated that 
their business contacts attributed the improvement in 
business sentiment to the expectation that firms would 
benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax, 
and regulatory policies.  A few participants indicated that 
some of their contacts had already increased their 
planned capital expenditures.  However, participants’ 
contacts in some Districts, while optimistic, intended to 
wait for more clarity about federal policy initiatives be-
fore adjusting their capital spending and hiring.  In addi-
tion, contacts in some industries remained concerned 
that their businesses might be adversely affected by 
some of the government policy changes being consid-
ered.  Activity in the energy sector continued to improve, 
with District contacts reporting an increase in capital 
spending, better access to credit, and a pickup in hiring.  
However, reports from a couple of Districts indicated 
that the agricultural sector was still weak, with low com-
modity prices continuing to put financial pressure on 
farm-related businesses. 

The labor market continued to strengthen in recent 
months.  Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment 
averaged 165,000 over the period from October to De-
cember, a pace that, if it continued, would be expected 
to increase labor utilization over time.  At 4.7 percent in 
December, the unemployment rate remained close to 
levels that most participants judged to be consistent with 
the Committee’s maximum-employment objective.  
Some participants cited other indicators confirming the 
strengthening in the labor market, such as a decline in 
the broader measures of labor underutilization that in-
clude workers marginally attached to the labor force, the 
rise in the quits rate, and faster increases in some 
measures of labor compensation.  Moreover, several 
participants’ business contacts reported shortages of 
workers in some occupations or the need for training 

programs to expand the supply of skilled workers.  Sev-
eral other participants thought that some margins of la-
bor underutilization remained, citing the still-high rate of 
prime-age workers outside the labor force, the elevated 
share of workers who were employed part time for eco-
nomic reasons, or the potential for further firming in la-
bor force participation.  However, a couple of partici-
pants pointed out that the uncertainty attending esti-
mates of longer-run trends in part-time employment and 
labor force participation made it difficult to assess the 
scope for additional increases in labor utilization.  Most 
participants still expected that if economic growth re-
mained moderate, labor markets would continue to 
tighten gradually, with the unemployment rate running 
only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run 
normal rate.  However, several participants projected a 
more substantial undershooting. 

Information on inflation received over the intermeeting 
period was broadly in line with participants’ expectations 
and was consistent with a view that PCE inflation was 
moving closer to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
The 12-month change in headline PCE prices increased 
further, to 1.6 percent in December, as the effects of the 
earlier declines in consumer energy prices waned.  The 
12-month change in core PCE prices stayed near 1.7 per-
cent for a fifth consecutive month.  A few participants 
noted that other measures provided additional evidence 
that inflation was approaching the Committee’s objec-
tive; for example, the 12-month changes in the headline 
and core CPI, the median CPI, and the trimmed mean 
PCE price index had also moved up from year-earlier 
levels.  The available information on pricing from Dis-
trict business contacts varied, with a couple of partici-
pants reporting that firms were experiencing rising cost 
pressures from input costs or had been able to raise their 
prices, while a few other participants said that firms in 
their Districts were not experiencing price pressures or 
that the appreciation of the dollar was continuing to hold 
down import prices.  Most survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations had been little 
changed in recent months.  The median response to the 
Michigan survey of longer-run inflation expectations 
moved back up to 2.6 percent in January, in line with the 
average of readings during 2016, and the measure at the 
three-year horizon from the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York’s survey rose slightly in December; the 
measures calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland had been stable over the preceding three 
months.  Some market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation had turned up noticeably in late 2016, but a

number of participants noted that they remained rela-
tively low.  Most participants continued to expect that 
inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objec-
tive over the medium term.  Some saw a risk that infla-
tionary pressures might develop more rapidly than cur-
rently anticipated as resource utilization tightened, while 
several others thought that progress in achieving the 
Committee’s inflation objective might lag if further ap-
preciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy 
commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to 
tighter resource utilization. 

Financial conditions appeared to have changed little, on 
net, in recent months:  Equity prices had risen and credit 
spreads had narrowed, but longer-term interest rates had 
increased and the dollar had appreciated further.  In their 
discussion, participants considered how recent develop-
ments had affected their assessment of the stability of 
the U.S. financial system.  Overall, valuation pressures 
appeared to have risen for some types of assets, while 
financial-sector leverage remained low and risks associ-
ated with maturity and liquidity transformation had de-
clined.  A few participants commented that the recent 
increase in equity prices might in part reflect investors’ 
anticipation of a boost to earnings from a cut in corpo-
rate taxes or more expansionary fiscal policy, which 
might not materialize.  They also expressed concern that 
the low level of implied volatility in equity markets ap-
peared inconsistent with the considerable uncertainty at-
tending the outlook for such policy initiatives. 

Recent reforms had diminished the risk of runs on or by 
prime money market funds.  However, it was noted that 
other risks to financial stability might arise as the struc-
ture of funding markets evolved or if real estate asset 
values declined sharply.  More broadly, it was pointed 
out that an environment of low interest rates and a rela-
tively flat yield curve, if it persisted, had the potential to 
boost incentives to take on leverage and risk.  Several 
participants emphasized that the increased resilience of 
the financial system since the financial crisis had im-
portantly been the result of the key safety and soundness 
reforms put in place in recent years.  However, having 
additional macroprudential tools could prove useful in 
addressing problems that could arise in real estate fi-
nancing or in the shadow banking sector. 

Participants discussed whether their current assessments 
of economic conditions and the medium-term outlook 
warranted altering their earlier views of the appropriate 
path for the target range for the federal funds rate.  Par-
ticipants generally characterized their economic fore-
casts and their judgments about monetary policy as little 

changed since the December meeting.  Against this 
backdrop, they thought it appropriate to maintain the 
target range for the federal funds rate at ½ to ¾ percent 
at this meeting. 

Most participants continued to judge that, while the out-
look was subject to considerable uncertainty, a gradual 
pace of rate increases over time was likely to be appro-
priate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maxi-
mum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Some partic-
ipants viewed a gradual pace as likely to be warranted 
because inflation was still running below the Commit-
tee’s objective or because the proximity of the federal 
funds rate to the effective lower bound placed con-
straints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to 
adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and 
services.  In addition, it was noted that the downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates exerted by the 
Federal Reserve’s asset holdings was expected to dimin-
ish in the years ahead in light of an anticipated gradual 
reduction in the size and duration of the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet.  Finally, the view that gradual in-
creases in the federal funds rate were likely to be appro-
priate also reflected the assessment that the neutral real 
rate—defined as the real interest rate that is neither ex-
pansionary nor contractionary when the economy is op-
erating at or near its potential—was currently quite low 
and was likely to rise only slowly over time. 

Participants emphasized that the Committee might need 
to change its communications regarding the anticipated 
path for the policy rate if economic conditions evolved 
differently than the Committee expected or if the eco-
nomic outlook changed.  They pointed to a number of 
risks that, if realized, might call for a different policy tra-
jectory than they currently thought most likely to be ap-
propriate.  These included upside risks such as apprecia-
bly more expansionary fiscal policy or a more rapid 
buildup of inflationary pressures, as well as downside 
risks associated with a possible further appreciation of 
the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign 
economies, together with the proximity of the federal 
funds rate to the effective lower bound.  Moreover, most 
participants continued to see heightened uncertainty re-
garding the size, composition, and timing of possible 
changes to fiscal and other government policies, and 
about their net effects on the economy and inflation 
over the medium term, and they thought some time 
would likely be required for the outlook to become 
clearer.  A couple of participants argued that such uncer-
tainty should not deter the Committee from taking fur-
ther steps in the near term to remove monetary policy 
accommodation, because fiscal and other policies were

only some of the many factors that were likely to influ-
ence progress toward the Committee’s dual-mandate ob-
jectives and thus the appropriate course of monetary 
policy.  However, other participants cautioned against 
adjusting monetary policy in anticipation of policy pro-
posals that might not be enacted or that, if enacted, 
might turn out to have different consequences for eco-
nomic activity and inflation than currently anticipated. 

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy over the 
period ahead, many participants expressed the view that 
it might be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate 
again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor 
market and inflation was in line with or stronger than 
their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting 
the Committee’s maximum-employment and inflation 
objectives increased.  A few participants noted that con-
tinuing to remove policy accommodation in a timely 
manner, potentially at an upcoming meeting, would al-
low the Committee greater flexibility in responding to 
subsequent changes in economic conditions.  Several 
judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the 
longer-run normal unemployment rate was high, partic-
ularly if economic growth was faster than currently ex-
pected.  If that situation developed, the Committee 
might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly 
than most participants currently anticipated to limit the 
buildup of inflationary pressures.  However, with infla-
tion still short of the Committee’s objective and inflation 
expectations remaining low, a few others continued to 
see downside risks to inflation or anticipated only a grad-
ual return of inflation to the 2 percent objective as the 
labor market strengthened further.  A couple of partici-
pants expressed concern that the Committee’s commu-
nications about a gradual pace of policy firming might 
be misunderstood as a commitment to only one or two 
rate hikes per year and stressed the importance of com-
municating that policy will respond to the evolving eco-
nomic outlook as appropriate to achieve the Commit-
tee’s objectives.  Participants also generally agreed that 
the Committee should begin discussions at upcoming 
meetings about the economic conditions that could war-
rant changes in the existing policy of reinvesting pro-
ceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal 
payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed secu-
rities, as well as how those changes would be imple-
mented and communicated. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in December indicated that the 

labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had continued to expand at a moderate 
pace.  Job gains had remained solid, and the unemploy-
ment rate had stayed near its recent low.  Household 
spending had continued to rise moderately, while busi-
ness fixed investment had remained soft.  Measures of 
consumer and business sentiment had improved of late.  
Inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still 
below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation re-
mained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations were little changed on balance. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market conditions would strengthen 
somewhat further.  Members agreed that there was 
heightened uncertainty about the effects of possible 
changes in fiscal and other government policies, but that 
near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared 
roughly balanced.  Many members continued to see only 
a modest risk of a scenario in which the unemployment 
rate would substantially undershoot its longer-run nor-
mal level and inflation pressures would increase signifi-
cantly.  These members expressed the view that inflation 
was likely to rise toward 2 percent gradually, and that 
policymakers would likely have ample time to respond if 
signs of rising inflationary pressures did begin to emerge.  
Other members indicated that if the labor market ap-
peared to be tightening significantly more than antici-
pated or if inflation pressures appeared to be developing 
more rapidly than expected as resource utilization tight-
ened, it might become necessary to adjust the Commit-
tee’s communications about the expected path of the 
federal funds rate.  One member noted that, even if in-
coming data on the economy and inflation were con-
sistent with expectations, taking the next step in reduc-
ing policy accommodation relatively soon would give the 
Committee greater flexibility in calibrating policy to 
evolving economic conditions. 

At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, in-
flation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term.  This view was reinforced by the 
rise in inflation and increases in inflation compensation 
in recent months.  Against this backdrop and in light of 
the current shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, mem-
bers agreed that they would continue to closely monitor 
actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s in-
flation goal.

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers agreed to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ½ to ¾ percent.  They judged that the 
stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor 
market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. 

The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its objectives of maxi-
mum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-
ment would take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-
tions, and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  The Committee expected that economic con-
ditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that 
the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, members emphasized that the actual path of 
the federal funds rate would depend on the evolution of 
the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  Members noted 
that this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective February 2, 2017, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of ½ to ¾ percent, including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol-
iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 0.50 percent, in amounts limited only 

by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per- 
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in December indicates 
that the labor market has continued to 
strengthen and that economic activity has con-
tinued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains 
remained solid and the unemployment rate 
stayed near its recent low.  Household spending 
has continued to rise moderately while business 
fixed investment has remained soft.  Measures 
of consumer and business sentiment have im-
proved of late.  Inflation increased in recent 
quarters but is still below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remain low; 
most survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations are little changed, on bal-
ance. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee expects that, 
with gradual adjustments in the stance of mon-
etary policy, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace, labor market conditions will 
strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will 
rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-
term risks to the economic outlook appear 
roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to 
closely monitor inflation indicators and global 
economic and financial developments. 

In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ½ to ¾ percent.  The stance of

monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions and a return to 2 per-
cent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  In light of the current shortfall of 
inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress 
toward its inflation goal.  The Committee ex-
pects that economic conditions will evolve in a 
manner that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate 
is likely to remain, for some time, below levels 
that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the federal funds 
rate will depend on the economic outlook as in-
formed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 

funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley Fischer, 
Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Jerome 
H. Powell, and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-
changed at 0.75 percent and voted unanimously to ap-
prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount 
rate) at the existing level of 1.25 percent.6 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 14–15, 
2017.  The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on Febru-
ary 1, 2017.  

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on January 3, 2017, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on December 13–14, 2016.
