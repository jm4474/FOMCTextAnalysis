11/18/75

By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government 

securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the 

period October 21 through November 17, 1975, were approved, ratified, 

and confirmed.  

With Messrs. Volcker, Eastburn, and Jackson dissenting, the 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until 

otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the 

System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy 

directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
that output of goods and services--which had increased 
sharply in the third quarter--is expanding more moderately 
in the current quarter. Retail sales are reported to have 
risen in October, after 2 months of little net change.  
Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment con
tinued to recover, although at a less rapid rate than in 
the summer months. The unemployment rate rose to 8.6 per 
cent from 8.3 per cent in September, reflecting a sizable 
increase in the civilian labor force. Average wholesale 
prices of industrial commodities increased more in October 
than in the immediately preceding months, and prices of 
farm and food products rose sharply further. However, 
since mid-October prices of many agricultural products 
have declined. The advance in average wage rates in 
October was substantial.  

Since mid-October the exchange value of the dollar 
against leading foreign currencies has moved in a narrow 
range. The U.S. foreign trade surplus in September 
remained substantial, as both exports and imports rose 
moderately. Bank-reported private capital flows appear 
to have shifted to net outflows since September, and the 
volume of offerings of new foreign bonds in the U.S.  
market has been at record levels.



11/18/75

M1 rose at a 6.9 per cent annual rate from the 
average level during the second quarter to the average 
level during the third quarter. However, M1 grew rela
tively little in the months of the third quarter and it 
declined in October. Inflows of consumer-type time and 
savings deposits to banks and to nonbank thrift institu
tions remained moderate in October, and growth in M2 
and M3 slowed further. Most short- and long-term interest 
rates have declined further in recent weeks. Conditions 
in markets for State and local government securities have 
continued to be adversely affected by New York's financial 
problems.  

In light of the foregoing developments, it is the 
policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster 
financial conditions that will encourage continued 
economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pres
sures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of 
international transactions.  

To implement this policy, while taking more than 
usual account of developments in domestic and interna
tional financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve 
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with 
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months 
ahead.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would 

be held on December 16, 1975, at 9:00 a.m.  

The meeting adjourned.  

Secretary
