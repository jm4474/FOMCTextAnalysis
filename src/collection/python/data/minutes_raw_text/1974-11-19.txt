By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government 

securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the 

period October 15 through November 18, 1974, were approved, ratified, 

and confirmed.  

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the 

Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accord

ance with the following domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that 
real output of goods and services is falling significantly 
further in the current quarter while price and wage increases 
are continuing large. In October industrial production 
declined--after having changed little since May--and the 
unemployment rate increased further, from 5.8 to 6.0 per cent.

11/19/74

In recent weeks sizable cutbacks in automobile production 
have been announced, and claims for unemployment insurance 

have continued to increase. There are major uncertainties 

concerning the duration of the coal strike; a lengthy shut
down would have substantial effects on other industries. The 

October rise in wholesale prices of industrial commodities, 
although substantial, remained well below the extraordinarily 
rapid rate in the first 8 months of the year; prices of farm 
products and foods increased sharply.  

In recent weeks the dollar has declined further against 

leading foreign currencies. In the third quarter the U.S.  
foreign trade deficit was substantially larger than in the 
second quarter, but U.S. banks sharply reduced their foreign 
lending.  

Growth of the narrowly defined money stock picked up from 
the slow pace of the third quarter to an annual rate of 

about 5 per cent in October. Net inflows of consumer-type 

time and savings deposits at banks and at nonbank thrift 

institutions also improved in October, and the money supply 
measures more broadly defined expanded appreciably. Bank 

credit outstanding changed little, and banks reduced their 

borrowing through Euro-dollars and large-denomination CD's.  

Since mid-October markets for short- and long-term securities 
have improved, despite heavy Treasury financing and a large 

volume of corporate security issues. Interest rates on 

market securities in general have declined further, and mort

gage yields also have fallen somewhat. On November 13 the 
Board of Governors announced a restructuring of member bank 

reserve requirements, which will have the effect of releasing 
reserves to the banking system in the week beginning 

December 12.  

In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy 

of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial 

conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, 
supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and 

achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the 
Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market 
conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary 
aggregates over the months ahead.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would 

be held on December 16 and 17, 1974.  

The meeting adjourned.
