Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Mar-
ket Account (SOMA) reported on developments in do-
mestic and foreign financial markets.  The deputy man-
ager followed with a review of System open market op-
erations conducted during the period since the Commit-
tee met on March 17–18, 2015.  The deputy manager 
also discussed the outcomes of continued testing of the 
Federal Reserve’s term and overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations (term RRP operations and ON 
RRP operations, respectively).  The Open Market Desk 
conducted two term RRP operations over the March 
quarter-end.  The combination of term and ON RRP 
operations continued to provide a soft floor for money 
market rates over the intermeeting period, including 
around quarter-end.  Based on experience around recent 
quarter-ends, the deputy manager discussed possible 
plans for June test RRP operations.  The manager sum-
marized ongoing staff work related to improved data 
collection for, and possible adjustments to, the calcula-
tion of the effective federal funds rate that were intended 
to provide a more robust measure of trading conditions 
in the federal funds market over time. 

The Committee voted to renew the reciprocal currency 
arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of 
Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Fed-
eral Reserve’s participation in the North American 
Framework Agreement of 1994.  In addition, the Com-
mittee voted to renew the dollar and foreign currency 
liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, 
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European 
Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank.  The votes 
to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these 
standing arrangements are taken annually at the April 
meeting.  Mr. Lacker dissented on both votes because of 
his opposition, as indicated at the January meeting, to 
foreign exchange market intervention by the Federal Re-
serve, which such swap arrangements might facilitate, 
and because, in his view, such arrangements were best 
left to fiscal authorities. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign 
currencies for the System’s account over the 
intermeeting period.

Normalization Procedures 
The staff provided a briefing on issues related to the im-
plementation of monetary policy during the period im-
mediately following the first increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate, when it becomes appropriate.  
In their subsequent discussion, participants agreed that 
the Committee’s testing of normalization tools, in con-
junction with its other planning, had created conditions 
under which policy normalization would likely proceed 
smoothly once it commences.  Nonetheless, as part of 
prudent contingency planning, participants agreed to 
have the staff provide more frequent updates on finan-
cial market developments for a period after firming be-
gins.  Such updates would ensure that, if adjustments to 
policy normalization tools prove necessary to maintain 
appropriate control over money market rates, policy-
makers could make such changes in a timely manner.  
Participants also considered whether it might be appro-
priate, when the Committee first raises the target range 
for the federal funds rate, to increase the spread between 
the primary credit rate and the top of the federal funds 
rate target range.  One participant argued for such a step 
in order to bring the spread up to a level closer to that 
prevailing prior to the financial crisis, but several partic-
ipants favored maintaining the current spread at least un-
til the process of policy normalization was well under 
way and policymakers had considered carefully the po-
tential benefits and costs of such a change.  In part, that 
view reflected concerns that an increase in the spread 
that coincided with the initial step in policy normaliza-
tion could complicate communications regarding the 
Committee’s policy intentions. 

The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discus-
sion of normalization procedures. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the April 28–29 meeting 
indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) only 
edged up in the first quarter, with growth likely held 
down, in part, by transitory factors.  The pace of im-
provement in labor market conditions moderated some-
what, and the unemployment rate was unchanged over 
the intermeeting period.  Consumer price inflation con-
tinued to run below the FOMC’s longer-run objective of 
2 percent, partly restrained by earlier declines in energy 
prices along with further decreases in non-energy import 
prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion were still low, while survey measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations remained stable. 

Payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in the first 
quarter, on average, but the gain in March was smaller 

than in earlier months.  The unemployment rate re-
mained at 5.5 percent in March, the labor force partici-
pation rate edged down, and the employment-to-       
population ratio was little changed.  The share of work-
ers employed part time for economic reasons was also 
little changed.  In the private sector, the rate of job open-
ings edged up in February and was well above its pre-
recession level, while the rates of hiring and of quits were 
about flat and remained slightly above their levels of a 
year ago. 

Industrial production fell in the first quarter, with an-
other drop in the drilling of new oil and gas wells as well 
as a decrease in manufacturing output that appeared to 
reflect, in part, the effects of the labor dispute at West 
Coast ports.  Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested 
that light motor vehicle production would increase at a 
solid pace in the second quarter, but broader indicators 
of manufacturing activity, such as the readings on new 
orders from national and regional manufacturing sur-
veys, pointed to only modest gains in factory output over 
the next several months. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in-
creased in the first quarter, albeit at a much slower pace 
than in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Light motor vehicle 
sales, as well as the components of nominal retail sales 
used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to con-
struct its estimate of PCE, rebounded in March after de-
clining in February, suggesting that unusually severe win-
ter weather in February likely held down spending.  
Among the factors that influence household spending, 
real disposable income rose strongly, on net, in the first 
quarter, buoyed in part by earlier declines in energy 
prices.  In addition, further gains in house values and eq-
uity prices likely raised households’ net worth, and the 
index of consumer sentiment in the University of Mich-
igan Surveys of Consumers remained near its highest 
level since prior to the most recent recession. 

Residential investment increased at a slow pace in the 
first quarter, and other indicators of housing-sector ac-
tivity remained weak.  Starts and building permits for 
single-family homes decreased during the first quarter 
despite small gains in March; starts of multifamily units 
also declined during the first quarter.  Sales of new 
homes were little changed, on average, over February 
and March, while existing home sales edged up on net. 

Real private expenditures on business equipment and in-
tellectual property products rose modestly in the first 
quarter, and forward-looking indicators—including data 
on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods 

Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2015 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



and the national and regional surveys of business condi-
tions—were generally consistent with only small further 
gains in the near term.  Real spending for nonresidential 
structures fell considerably in the first quarter, as outlays 
for drilling and mining structures dropped sharply and 
outlays for other structures declined. 

Real government purchases moved down in the first 
quarter.  Federal spending was flat.  But construction ex-
penditures by state and local governments contracted, 
while these governments’ payrolls were unchanged. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in 
February, as imports fell more than exports.  Imports of 
all major categories of goods moved lower as imports 
from several major trading partners—including Canada, 
China, Japan, and Korea—registered declines.  Disrup-
tions related to the West Coast port labor disputes likely 
contributed to the decline in imports in February.  The 
reduction in exports was largest for durable goods and 
industrial supplies, with exports to Canada and China ac-
counting for most of the drop.  Despite the narrowing 
of the nominal trade deficit in February, the BEA esti-
mated that real net exports were a substantial drag on 
the growth of real GDP in the first quarter. 

Total U.S. consumer prices in the first quarter, as meas-
ured by the PCE price index, were only ¼ percent higher 
than a year earlier, importantly reflecting the decrease in 
consumer energy prices.  The core PCE price index, 
which excludes food and energy prices, increased 
1¼ percent over the same four-quarter period, partly re-
strained by the declines in prices of non-energy imported 
goods.  The PCE price index in February and the con-
sumer price index (CPI) in March rose at a faster pace 
than in previous months, as energy prices reversed a 
small part of their earlier declines.  Survey-based 
measures of expected long-run inflation were stable, 
with the measure from the Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers unchanged and the Michigan survey measure 
down a little but still in the range seen over recent years.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation at 
longer horizons increased somewhat but were still low.  
Over the 12 months ending in March, nominal average 
hourly earnings for all employees increased 2 percent, 
somewhat faster than the increase in core consumer 
prices over the same period. 

Economic growth in both advanced foreign and emerg-
ing market economies appeared to slow, on balance, in 
the first quarter of 2015.  Global trade and industrial pro-
duction weakened.  Among advanced economies, output 
growth declined in the United Kingdom and economic 
indicators for Canada and Japan also pointed to slower 

growth in the first quarter.  In contrast, real GDP growth 
seemed to have increased in the euro area.  In emerging 
market economies, real GDP growth slowed sharply in 
China and indicators of activity weakened in Mexico and 
Brazil, but real GDP growth picked up in some emerg-
ing Asian economies.  Inflation remained low in most 
economies, partly as a result of earlier declines in oil 
prices. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Financial conditions eased, on balance, over the inter-
meeting period.  Federal Reserve communications that 
were reportedly viewed as more accommodative than 
anticipated put downward pressure on interest rates.  A 
number of weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data re-
leases, including the March employment report, also 
pushed interest rates lower.  On net, measures of infla-
tion compensation rose, equity prices increased some-
what, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar de-
clined.   

The expected path of the federal funds rate moved down 
following the March FOMC statement and the Chair’s 
postmeeting press conference.  Investors reportedly 
took note of changes in the Summary of Economic Pro-
jections, including downward revisions to FOMC partic-
ipants’ projections of the appropriate level of the federal 
funds rate at the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017.  During 
the remainder of the intermeeting period, the expected 
policy rate path implied by financial market quotes 
shifted down further, in part because U.S. economic data 
were weaker, on net, than anticipated.  Results from the 
Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic-
ipants for April indicated that respondents saw the Sep-
tember 2015 meeting as the most likely time for the first 
increase in the target range for the federal funds rate; the 
probabilities attached to scenarios in which policy firm-
ing did not begin until after the July 2015 meeting were 
higher than the corresponding probabilities in the sur-
veys conducted before the March meeting. 

Over the intermeeting period, 5- and 10-year nominal 
Treasury yields decreased, but yields on Treasury           
Inflation-Protected Securities declined by a greater 
amount.  Measures of inflation compensation over the 
next 5 years rose significantly, consistent with increases 
in oil prices and somewhat higher-than-expected Febru-
ary and March consumer price inflation data.  Inflation 
compensation 5 to 10 years ahead also increased but re-
mained at the lower end of its range over the past few 
years. 

On balance, U.S. equity price indexes rose somewhat 
and option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index over 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the next month declined.  Energy firms’ stock prices re-
traced a small portion of their substantial drop since 
mid-2014.  Spreads of yields on 10-year speculative-
grade corporate bonds over those on comparable-      
maturity Treasury securities narrowed, in part because of 
a further decrease in spreads on speculative-grade bonds 
issued by energy firms.  About 40 percent of firms in the 
S&P 500 index had reported earnings for the first quar-
ter, with those reports generally viewed as better than 
anticipated.  Nonetheless, first-quarter earnings per 
share were expected to be lower than in the previous 
quarter. 

Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
accommodative.  Corporate bond issuance was strong in 
the first quarter, and seasoned equity offerings rose.  
Commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books again 
expanded briskly.  In the leveraged loan market, issuance 
of new money loans to institutional investors slowed in 
the first quarter but stayed robust, supported by contin-
ued strong issuance of collateralized loan obligations. 

Financing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained 
broadly available.  CRE loans on banks’ books increased 
appreciably in the first quarter, consistent with stronger 
loan demand reported in the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS).  
Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities con-
tinued to be robust. 

Measures of residential mortgage lending conditions 
were generally little changed over the intermeeting pe-
riod, and lending volumes remained light.  In the April 
SLOOS, some large banks reported having eased lend-
ing standards for a number of categories of residential 
mortgage loans in the first quarter.  House prices con-
tinued to rise moderately in February.  Nonetheless, es-
timates of the share of mortgages in a negative equity 
position were little changed in recent quarters, and they 
remained elevated when judged against levels prevailing 
prior to the crisis. 

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets stayed 
generally accommodative.  Auto and student loan bal-
ances expanded robustly through February.  Growth in 
credit card loans slowed a bit on a year-over-year basis, 
likely reflecting weaker retail activity. 

The U.S. dollar depreciated during the intermeeting pe-
riod, as U.S. macroeconomic data generally came in 
weaker than expected, and as market participants ap-
peared to mark down somewhat their expectations for 
the path of the federal funds rate.  Nonetheless, the cu-

mulative appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 re-
mained substantial.  Government bond yields in most 
advanced foreign economies declined modestly, pushing 
some yields, particularly in Europe, further into negative 
territory.  By contrast, Greek sovereign yields stayed el-
evated as the difficult negotiations between Greece and 
its official creditors continued.  Spillovers from Greek 
markets into other peripheral financial markets remained 
limited.  Equity prices in most advanced foreign econo-
mies moved higher, buoyed in part by ongoing monetary 
policy accommodation.  Equity prices also rose in most 
emerging market economies, with the stock market in 
China outperforming. 

The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to 
financial stability.  A number of factors appeared to limit 
the vulnerability of the U.S. financial system to adverse 
shocks.  Leverage in the banking system remained rela-
tively low, and increases in household debt stayed mod-
est and continued to be associated primarily with bor-
rowers with strong credit scores.  However, some indi-
cators suggested that valuations remained stretched for 
some asset classes.  An estimate of the expected real re-
turn on equities moved down, reflecting an increase in 
stock prices and downward revisions to forecasts of cor-
porate earnings, and corporate bond spreads declined 
somewhat.  The staff also noted changes in the structure 
of some fixed-income markets that could increase vola-
tility.  In addition, the staff discussed the risks to finan-
cial stability associated with the possibility of substantial 
unanticipated changes in longer-term U.S. interest rates, 
including the scope for a sharp increase in such rates to 
affect financial conditions in emerging market econo-
mies.  A number of other risks were noted, including ge-
opolitical tensions and the potential for an increase in 
financial strains related to the negotiations between 
Greece and its official creditors. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for 
the April FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first 
half of the year was lower than in the projection pre-
pared for the March meeting, as the data on economic 
activity received during the intermeeting period were 
generally weaker than the staff had expected.  However, 
much of this weakness was attributed to transitory fac-
tors or statistical noise, with little implication for the 
pace of expansion beyond the near term.  Indeed, the 
medium-term projection for real GDP growth was re-
vised up modestly, as monetary policy was assumed to 
be a little more accommodative in this projection and 
the projected path for the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar was a little lower.  The staff continued to project 

Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2015 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



that real GDP would expand at a faster pace than poten-
tial output in 2015 and 2016, supported by increases in 
consumer and business confidence and a small pickup in 
foreign economic growth, even as the normalization of 
monetary policy was assumed to begin.  In 2017, real 
GDP growth was projected to slow toward, but to re-
main above, the rate of growth of potential output.  The 
expansion in economic activity over the medium term 
was expected to lead to a gradual reduction in resource 
slack; the unemployment rate was projected to decline 
slowly and to move a little below the staff’s estimate of 
its longer-run natural rate for a time. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was re-
vised up a little, reflecting the slightly higher-than-        
expected recent monthly data on core consumer prices 
and a path for crude oil prices that was a bit higher than 
in the previous projection.  The medium-term forecast 
for inflation was little changed, with inflation in 2016 
and 2017 projected to move closer to, but remain below, 
the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, as 
energy prices were expected to rise, import prices to turn 
up, and resource utilization to tighten further.  Thereaf-
ter, inflation was anticipated to move back to 2 percent, 
with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to 
be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack 
in labor and product markets projected to have waned. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its April projec-
tions for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  
The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were 
seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s as-
sessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy ap-
peared well positioned to help the economy withstand 
substantial adverse shocks.  At the same time, the staff 
viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemploy-
ment rate as roughly balanced. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants regarded the information 
received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that 
economic growth had slowed during the winter months, 
in part reflecting transitory factors.  The pace of job 
gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had 
remained steady, with a range of labor market indicators 
suggesting that underutilization of labor resources was 
little changed.  Most participants expected that, follow-
ing the slowdown in the first quarter, real economic ac-
tivity would resume expansion at a moderate pace, and 

that labor market conditions would improve further.  In-
flation continued to run below the Committee’s longer-
run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy 
prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation re-
mained low, while survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations had remained stable.  Partic-
ipants generally anticipated that inflation would rise 
gradually toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective as 
the labor market improved further and the transitory ef-
fects of declines in energy prices and non-energy import 
prices dissipated.  Participants judged that recent domes-
tic economic developments had increased uncertainty 
regarding the economic outlook.  While participants 
continued to see potential downside risks resulting from 
foreign economic and financial developments, most still 
viewed the risks to the outlook for economic growth and 
the labor market as nearly balanced. 

Participants generally agreed that data on private spend-
ing for the first quarter had been disappointing, with un-
expectedly weak household expenditures and invest-
ment spending.  Retail sales had continued to be tepid, 
although consumer sentiment stayed high and auto sales 
rebounded in March.  The recovery in the housing sector 
remained slow.  Business fixed investment softened, in 
part reflecting sizable reductions in capital expenditures 
in the energy sector.  Exports contracted, likely reflect-
ing the damping influence of the dollar’s appreciation.  
In combination with a decline in government spending, 
the weakness of private spending had led to a substantial 
slowing in economic growth in the first quarter. 

Participants discussed whether the weakness of spend-
ing in the first quarter primarily reflected temporary fac-
tors or instead suggested a longer-lasting loss of momen-
tum for the economy.  A number of reasons were ad-
vanced for believing that the weakness in spending ob-
served during the first quarter was partly or even largely 
transitory.  Most notably, the severe winter weather in 
some regions had reportedly weighed on economic ac-
tivity, and the labor dispute at West Coast ports tempo-
rarily disrupted some supply chains.  Furthermore, a pat-
tern observed in previous years of the current expansion 
was that the first quarter of the year tended to have 
weaker seasonally adjusted readings on economic 
growth than did the subsequent quarters.  This tendency 
supported the expectation that economic growth would 
return to a moderate pace over the rest of this year.  Par-
ticipants also pointed to other reasons for anticipating 
that the weakness seen in the first quarter would not en-
dure.  A number of the fundamental factors that drive 
consumer spending remained favorable, among them 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



low interest rates, high consumer confidence, and rising 
household real income.  In addition, business contacts in 
several parts of the country continued to be optimistic 
and expected sales, investment, and hiring to expand 
over the rest of the year.  In the agricultural sector, 
drought effects had worsened in some parts of the coun-
try, but effects on production were limited and planting 
intentions remained strong.  Finally, if the decline in oil 
prices and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar did not continue, then their influence on the 
growth rate of investment and the change in net exports 
would likely recede. 

Various reasons were also advanced for believing that 
some of the recent weakness in the pace of economic 
activity might persist.  A number of participants sug-
gested that the damping effects of the earlier apprecia-
tion of the dollar on net exports or of the earlier decline 
in oil prices on firms’ investment spending might be 
larger and longer-lasting than previously anticipated. In 
addition, the expected boost to household spending 
from lower energy prices had apparently so far not ma-
terialized, highlighting the possibility of less underlying 
momentum in consumer expenditures than participants 
had previously judged.  Some participants expressed par-
ticular concern about this prospect, as their expectations 
of a moderate expansion of economic activity in the me-
dium term, combined with further improvements in la-
bor market conditions, rested largely on a scenario in 
which consumer spending grows robustly despite soft-
ness in other components of aggregate demand.  Partic-
ipants discussed downside risks to economic growth, 
and a few indicated that, in their assessment, such risks 
had risen since the March meeting.  However, most par-
ticipants continued to see the risks to the outlook for 
economic growth and the labor market as nearly bal-
anced. 

In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, sev-
eral participants noted that the foreign exchange value 
of the U.S. dollar had fallen back somewhat over the in-
termeeting period.  Nonetheless, the value of the dollar 
had increased significantly since the middle of last year, 
and it was seen as likely to continue to be a factor re-
straining U.S. net exports and economic growth for a 
time.  It was suggested that one element underpinning 
the strength of the U.S. dollar was the increasing preva-
lence of negative interest rates on sovereign debt in some 
key European economies.  Participants also pointed to a 
number of risks to the international economic outlook, 
including the slowdown in growth in China and fiscal 
and financial problems in Greece. 

Many participants judged that the pace of improvement 
in labor market conditions had slowed.  The March in-
crease in payrolls had been smaller than expected, and 
the unemployment rate had remained steady.  However, 
it was noted that the intermeeting period had also wit-
nessed some more-positive news on labor market con-
ditions, including a further increase in the rate of job 
openings.  Various business contacts in energy-related 
sectors reported layoffs in response to low oil prices, but 
some information received from business contacts sug-
gested a tightening in labor markets, with shortages of 
skilled labor reported in some areas and sectors; there 
had also been an increase in transitions of workers to 
better-paying jobs.  Larger wage gains were also reported 
in some regions, although in other parts of the country 
wage pressures reportedly remained muted.  One partic-
ipant suggested that a significant rise in aggregate nomi-
nal wage growth should be a criterion in assessing the 
Committee’s degree of confidence regarding the return 
of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run ob-
jective.  However, a couple of other participants argued 
that the behavior of nominal wage growth should not 
play a significant role in that assessment, on the grounds 
that there was only a loose relationship between nominal 
wage growth and inflation in the United States. 

Many participants noted that measures of inflation aver-
aged over several months or more continued to run be-
low the Committee’s longer-run objective.  However, 
this shortfall partly reflected the earlier declines in energy 
prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports, and 
some participants pointed out that, by some measures, 
the most recent monthly inflation readings had firmed a 
bit.  Although participants expected that inflation would 
continue, in the near term, to be below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, energy prices were no 
longer declining and most participants continued to ex-
pect that inflation would move up toward the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term as the 
effects of the transitory factors waned and conditions in 
the labor market and the overall economy improved fur-
ther.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations 
had remained broadly stable.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation had risen slightly but remained 
low.  One participant suggested that, in the past, market-
based measures of inflation compensation had been of 
little value in predicting inflation one to two years ahead, 
and that measures of inflation expectations from surveys 
of professional forecasters were more useful for fore-
casting inflation.  Another participant argued that low 
values for market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation should concern policymakers, on the grounds that

these low values reflected investors placing at least some 
likelihood on adverse outcomes in which low inflation 
was accompanied by weak economic activity. 

In their discussion of financial market developments and 
financial stability issues, policymakers highlighted possi-
ble risks related to the low level of term premiums.  
Some participants noted the possibility that, at the time 
when the Committee decides to begin policy firming, 
term premiums could rise sharply—in a manner similar 
to the increase observed in the spring and summer of 
2013—which might drive longer-term interest rates 
higher.  In this connection, it was suggested that the ten-
dency for bond prices to exhibit volatility may be greater 
than it had been in the past, in view of the increased role 
of high-frequency traders, decreased inventories of 
bonds held by broker-dealers, and elevated assets of 
bond funds.  A couple of participants underscored the 
need for a better understanding of the structure of the 
bond market in the current environment, including the 
effect on bond market behavior of regulatory changes.  
Some participants noted that careful Committee com-
munications regarding its policy intentions could help 
damp any resulting increase in market volatility around 
the time of the commencement of normalization.  It was 
also noted that financial stability and the Committee’s 
macroeconomic goals were likely to be complementary 
objectives, but different views were expressed about the 
potential implications for financial stability of monetary 
policy tightening in current economic conditions. 

In their discussion of communications regarding the 
path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, 
participants expressed a range of views about when eco-
nomic conditions were likely to warrant an increase in 
the target range for the federal funds rate.  Participants 
continued to judge that it would be appropriate to raise 
the target range for the federal funds rate when they had 
seen further improvement in the labor market and were 
reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 
its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Although 
participants expressed different views about the likely 
timing and pace of policy firming, they agreed that the 
Committee’s decision to begin firming would appropri-
ately depend on the incoming data and their implications 
for the economic outlook.  A few anticipated that the 
information that would accrue by the time of the June 
meeting would likely indicate sufficient improvement in 
the economic outlook to lead the Committee to judge 
that its conditions for beginning policy firming had been 
met.  Many participants, however, thought it unlikely 
that the data available in June would provide sufficient 
confirmation that the conditions for raising the target 

range for the federal funds rate had been satisfied, al-
though they generally did not rule out this possibility.  
Participants discussed the merits of providing an explicit 
indication, in postmeeting statements released prior to 
the commencement of policy firming, that the target 
range for the federal funds rate would likely be raised in 
the near term.  However, most participants felt that the 
timing of the first increase in the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate would appropriately be determined on a 
meeting-by-meeting basis and would depend on the evo-
lution of economic conditions and the outlook.  In keep-
ing with this data-dependent approach, some partici-
pants further suggested that the postmeeting statement’s 
description of the economic situation and outlook, and 
of progress toward the Committee’s goals, provided the 
appropriate means by which the Committee could help 
the public assess the likely timing of the initial increase 
in the target range for the federal funds rate. 

During their discussion of economic conditions and 
monetary policy, participants also commented on differ-
ent concepts of the equilibrium real federal funds rate—
that is, a reference value of the inflation-adjusted federal 
funds rate consistent with the economy achieving, over 
a specified time horizon, maximum employment and 
price stability.  Estimates of such equilibrium real inter-
est rates were highly uncertain, but some participants re-
ported that their estimates were currently unusually low 
by historical standards, reflecting, for example, factors 
weighing persistently on aggregate demand.  In light of 
their low estimates, a few of these participants ques-
tioned whether the Committee was providing sufficient 
accommodation at the present time and cautioned 
against initiating policy firming in the near future.  How-
ever, other participants cited factors, including the cur-
rent low level of term premiums, that might cast doubt 
on the notion that the equilibrium real federal funds rate 
was particularly low.  Some participants observed that 
more discussion of this topic was likely to be helpful in 
assessing these issues.  One participant suggested that, in 
part because of the evidence that the equilibrium real in-
terest rate was low by historical standards, the Commit-
tee should discuss the possibility of increasing its longer-
run inflation objective.  This participant and a few others 
thought such a discussion could be useful but empha-
sized that any decision to change the Committee’s 
longer-run goals and policy strategy should not be made 
lightly.  One of these participants noted, in particular, 
that a decision to raise the Committee’s longer-run infla-
tion objective might work against the achievement of 
maximum employment and price stability because such 
a change could undermine the Committee’s credibility

and, in addition, lead to adverse changes in inflation dy-
namics that could pose significant challenges for policy-
makers.  

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in March suggested that economic 
growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflect-
ing transitory factors.  The pace of job gains moderated, 
and the unemployment rate remained steady.  A range 
of labor market indicators suggested that underutiliza-
tion of labor resources was little changed.  Although 
growth in household spending declined, households’ 
real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier de-
clines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment re-
mained high.  Business fixed investment softened, the 
recovery in the housing sector remained slow, and ex-
ports declined.  Inflation continued to run below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, but this partly re-
flected earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing 
prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
had remained stable.  Despite the slower growth in out-
put and employment observed of late, members contin-
ued to expect that, with appropriate policy accommoda-
tion, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move 
toward levels the Committee judged consistent with its 
dual mandate.  Members generally continued to see the 
risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor 
market as nearly balanced.  Inflation was anticipated to 
remain near its recent low level in the near term, but 
members expected inflation to rise gradually toward        
2 percent over the medium term as further improvement 
in the labor market occurred and the transitory effects 
of declines in energy and import prices dissipated.  In 
light of the uncertainties associated with the outlook for 
inflation, the Committee agreed that it would continue 
to monitor inflation developments closely. 
 
In their discussion of language for the postmeeting state-
ment, members agreed that the wording should reflect 
their assessment that economic conditions had pro-
gressed to a stage at which the Committee’s decision to 
begin normalizing policy would appropriately be deter-
mined on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  The Committee 
agreed that the statement should indicate that the data 
received over the intermeeting period suggested that 
economic growth had slowed and to note that this partly 
reflected transitory factors.  The Committee also agreed 

to change the statement’s characterization of the labor 
market data to note that the pace of job growth slowed 
over the intermeeting period and that a number of labor 
market indicators suggested that there was little change 
in underutilization of labor resources, and to update the 
statement’s description of investment and export behav-
ior in light of the recent weaker readings.  In addition, 
members agreed to modify the discussion of inflation 
developments to indicate that inflation, although no 
longer declining, was still below the Committee’s longer-
term objective and was likely to remain so in the near 
term, partly because of transitory factors such as earlier 
declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-
energy imports.  The Committee altered its characteriza-
tion of the economic outlook to indicate that, while eco-
nomic growth slowed in the first quarter, the Committee 
continued to expect that, with appropriate policy accom-
modation, economic activity would expand at a moder-
ate pace, and that it anticipated that labor market indica-
tors would resume their movement toward levels that 
the Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate.  
With respect to the outlook for inflation, members ex-
pected inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over 
the medium term as the labor market improves further 
and the transitory effects of declines in energy and im-
port prices dissipate. 

The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm 
in the statement that the Committee’s decision about 
how long to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of ac-
tual and expected progress toward its objectives of max-
imum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Members 
continued to judge that this assessment of progress 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments.  
Members agreed to retain the indication that the Com-
mittee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen 
further improvement in the labor market and is reason-
ably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term. 

The Committee also decided to maintain its policy of re-
investing principal payments from agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-
backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Com-
mittee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable lev-

els, should help maintain accommodative financial con-
ditions.  The Committee agreed to reiterate its expecta-
tion that, even after employment and inflation are near 
mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, 
for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds 
rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to       
¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk 
to undertake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain such conditions.  The 
Committee directs the Desk to maintain its 
policy of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities into new issues and its policy of 
reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities 
in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in 
dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the 
Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.  The System Open 
Market Account manager and the secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 
sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below 
to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in March suggests 
that economic growth slowed during the win-
ter months, in part reflecting transitory fac-
tors.  The pace of job gains moderated, and 
the unemployment rate remained steady.  A 
range of labor market indicators suggests that 
underutilization of labor resources was little 

changed.  Growth in household spending de-
clined; households’ real incomes rose 
strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in 
energy prices, and consumer sentiment re-
mains high.  Business fixed investment sof-
tened, the recovery in the housing sector re-
mained slow, and exports declined.  Inflation 
continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier 
declines in energy prices and decreasing prices 
of non-energy imports.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remain 
low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  Although growth in 
output and employment slowed during the 
first quarter, the Committee continues to ex-
pect that, with appropriate policy accommo-
dation, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace, with labor market indicators 
continuing to move toward levels the Com-
mittee judges consistent with its dual man-
date.  The Committee continues to see the 
risks to the outlook for economic activity and 
the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation 
is anticipated to remain near its recent low 
level in the near term, but the Committee ex-
pects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 per-
cent over the medium term as the labor mar-
ket improves further and the transitory effects 
of declines in energy and import prices dissi-
pate.  The Committee continues to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 

To support continued progress toward maxi-
mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that the 
current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In de-
termining how long to maintain this target 
range, the Committee will assess progress—
both realized and expected—toward its objec-
tives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indica-
tors of inflation pressures and inflation expec-
tations, and readings on financial and interna-
tional developments.  The Committee antici-
pates that it will be appropriate to raise the

target range for the federal funds rate when it 
has seen further improvement in the labor 
market and is reasonably confident that infla-
tion will move back to its 2 percent objective 
over the medium term. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treas-
ury securities at auction.  This policy, by keep-
ing the Committee’s holdings of longer-term 
securities at sizable levels, should help main-
tain accommodative financial conditions. 

When the Committee decides to begin to re-
move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-
anced approach consistent with its longer-run 
goals of maximum employment and inflation 
of 2 percent.  The Committee currently antic-
ipates that, even after employment and infla-
tion are near mandate-consistent levels, eco-
nomic conditions may, for some time, warrant 
keeping  the  target  federal  funds  rate  below 

levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run.”

C. Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Jeffrey M. Lacker, Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome 
H. Powell, Daniel K. Tarullo, and John C. Williams. 

Voting against this action:  None.
