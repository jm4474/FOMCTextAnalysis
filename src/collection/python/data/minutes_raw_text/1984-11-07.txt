By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government 

securities and agency obligations during the period October 2 through 

November 6, 1984, were ratified.  

With Mr. Gramley dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 

execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 

domestic policy directive: 

The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
a mixed pattern of developments but on balance suggests 
that economic activity is continuing to expand, though 
at a considerably more moderate pace than earlier in 
the year. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially 
outside of manufacturing in October, following a moderate 
increase in September, and the civilian unemployment



11/7/84

rate was unchanged at 7.4 percent. Industrial pro
duction fell in September, partly because of strikes, 
and available information suggests little increase 
in October. Retail sales and housing starts rebounded 

in September after two months of decline. Information 
on outlays and spending plans suggests slower ex
pansion in business fixed investment, following 
exceptionally rapid growth earlier, and inventory 
investment, having risen relative to sales in 
recent months, also appears to be slowing. Since 
the beginning of the year, broad measures of prices 
generally have continued to rise at rates close to, 
or somewhat above, those recorded in 1983, and the 
index of average hourly earnings has risen somewhat 
more slowly.  

Growth of the monetary aggregates strengthened 
in September, but data available for October indicated 
that M1 declined during the month, growth of M2 slowed 
somewhat, and expansion of M3 picked up further. From 
the fourth quarter of 1983 through October, M1 grew 
at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's range 
for 1984, M2 at a rate somewhat below the midpoint 
of its longer-run range, and M3 at a rate a bit above 
the upper limit of its range. Growth in total domestic 
nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing above the 
Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting 
large government borrowing; private credit growth, 
though relatively strong, has moderated in recent 
months. Interest rates have fallen substantially 
further since the meeting of the Committee on 
October 2.  

Over the past month, the foreign exchange value 
of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of 
major foreign currencies has continued to fluctuate 
widely, rising to a new high in mid-October but 
subsequently declining to somewhat below its level at 
the time of the previous meeting. The merchandise 
trade deficit in the third quarter was substantially 
above the first-half rate as a sharp rise in non-oil 
imports exceeded some further growth in exports.  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to 
foster monetary and financial conditions that will 
help to reduce inflation further, promote growth 
in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to 
an improved pattern of international transactions.



11/7/84 -5

In furtherance of these objectives the Committee 
agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges 
for monetary growth that it had established in 

January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent 
for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth 
quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984.  
The associated range for total domestic non
financial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 
percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated 

that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at 
rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 
1984 ranges, given developments in the first half 
of the year, but the Committee felt that higher 
target ranges would provide inappropriate bench
marks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and 

credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on 
tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured 
from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter 

of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent 
for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated 
range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 
percent.  

The Committee understood that policy implementation 
would require continuing appraisal of the relationships 
not only among the various measures of money and credit 
but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, 
including evaluations of conditions in domestic credit 
and foreign exchange markets.  

In the implementation of policy in the short run, 
the Committee seeks to reduce somewhat existing pressures 
on reserve positions. This action is expected to be 
consistent with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of 
around 7-1/2 and 9 percent during the period from 
September to December. M1 is expected to grow over 
the period at an annual rate of around 3 percent, less 
than anticipated earlier in view of the decline in 
October. In light of that decline, more rapid growth 
of M1 would be acceptable. Lesser restraint on reserve 
positions would be sought in the event of significantly 
slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in 
relation to the strength of the business expansion and 
inflationary pressures, domestic and international 
financial market conditions, and the rate of credit 
growth. Conversely, greater restraint might be accept
able in the event of substantially more rapid monetary



11/7/84

growth and indications of significant strengthening 
of economic activity and inflationary pressures. The 
Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it 
appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that 
pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve 
paths during the period before the next meeting is 
likely to be associated with a federal funds rate 
persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 

held on Tuesday, December 18, 1984.  

The meeting adjourned.  

Secretary's note: Subsequent to this meeting, the 
Committee unanimously approved temporary increases 
in the limit on changes between Committee meetings 
in System Account holdings of U.S. government and 
federal agency securities specified in paragraph 
1(a) of the authorization for domestic open market 
operations. The first action, increasing the 
limit from $4 billion to $6 billion was effective 
November 21, 1984; the second increase, from 
$6 billion to $8 billion, was effective on 
December 5, 1984. Both increases applied to 
the intermeeting period ending with the close 
of business on December 18, 1984.
