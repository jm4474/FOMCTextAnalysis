Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets during the period since the Com-
mittee met on April 26–27, 2016.  Market participants’ 
expectations for a firming of monetary policy at the June 
FOMC meeting rose considerably in the middle of the 
period, largely in response to monetary policy commu-
nications, but those expectations subsequently fell 
sharply following the release of labor market data for 
May.  Nominal yields on Treasury securities declined 
over the period.  Forward measures of inflation compen-
sation derived from yields on nominal and inflation- 
indexed Treasury securities fell despite an appreciable in-
crease in crude oil prices, a development that contrasted 
with the positive correlation between these variables that 
had been evident for some time.  The manager also 
noted that bond yields globally had declined to very low 
levels and discussed some of the possible reasons for the 
drop.  Actions by investors to shift their portfolios away 
from very low-yielding foreign sovereign debt were cited 
as adding to the downward pressure on U.S. yields.  The 
manager also reviewed the apparent effects on financial 
markets of changes in the perceived odds that the United 
Kingdom would vote in a referendum on June 23 to 
leave the European Union. 

In domestic money markets, the effective federal funds 
rate once again stayed close to the middle of the 
FOMC’s ¼ to ½ percent target range over the inter-
meeting period except on month-ends.  Usage of the 
System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility 
remained low.  Market participants anticipated that 
changes to the regulation of money market mutual funds 
that will take effect later in the year could lead to some 
increase in usage of the facility.  Finally, the manager 
briefed the Committee on various efforts, including 
small-value tests of System facilities, to enhance opera-
tional readiness. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.

There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the June 14–15 meeting 
indicated that the pace of improvement in labor market 
conditions slowed in April and May but that real gross 
domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising faster 
than in the first quarter.  Consumer price inflation con-
tinued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objec-
tive of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases 
in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  
Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-
tions were mixed in recent months, while market-based 
measures of inflation compensation declined from levels 
that were already low. 

Total nonfarm payroll employment gains slowed in April 
and May, even after adjusting for the effects of a strike 
at a large telecommunications company.  The unemploy-
ment rate dropped to 4.7 percent in May, partly reflect-
ing an unusually large number of unemployed persons 
exiting the labor force.  Over the first two months of the 
second quarter, both the labor force participation rate 
and the employment-to-population ratio moved down 
on net.  The share of workers employed part time for 
economic reasons rose noticeably in May.  Although the 
rate of private-sector job openings remained elevated, 
the rate of hires declined in both March and April and 
the rate of quits was unchanged.  The four-week moving 
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits moved up a little, on net, from late April to early 
June but was still at a low level.  Labor productivity 
growth remained slow over the four quarters ending in 
the first quarter of 2016.  Measures of labor compensa-
tion continued to rise at a moderate pace on balance:  
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
increased 3¾ percent over the four quarters ending in 
the first quarter, the employment cost index for private 
workers rose 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in 
March, and average hourly earnings for all employees in-
creased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in May. 

The unemployment rates for African Americans and for 
Hispanics stayed above the rate for whites, although the 
differentials in jobless rates across the different groups 
were similar to those before the most recent recession.  
The share of African American and Hispanic workers 
employed part time for economic reasons remained 
higher than for whites, and the gap in these rates was 
wider than in the years just before the most recent reces-
sion. 

Total industrial production (IP) rose in April, principally 
reflecting a rebound in the output of utilities following a 
couple of unseasonably warm winter months as well as 
a moderate increase in manufacturing production.  
Meanwhile, mining output continued to contract as a re-
sult of further declines in drilling activity, a slower pace 
of crude oil extraction, and a continued pullback in coal 
production.  A variety of indicators—including manu-
facturing production worker hours, motor vehicle as-
semblies, and oil and gas extraction and drilling activ-
ity—suggested that IP likely declined in May.  Automak-
ers’ assembly schedules and mixed readings on other in-
dicators of manufacturing production, such as new or-
ders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, 
pointed to only subdued gains in factory output over the 
next few months. 

Growth in real personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) appeared to be picking up in the second quarter.  
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its esti-
mate of PCE rose at a solid pace in April and May, and 
sales of light motor vehicles rebounded after dipping in 
March.  The apparent pickup in real PCE growth was 
consistent with recent readings on key factors that influ-
ence consumer spending.  Gains in real disposable per-
sonal income continued to be solid in March and April, 
and households’ net worth was boosted by further 
strong increases in home values through April.  Also, 
consumer sentiment as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained upbeat in 
early June. 

Recent information on housing activity was broadly con-
sistent with a continued gradual recovery in this sector.  
Starts for new single-family homes increased in April but 
were below the average pace in the first quarter, and 
building permit issuance remained essentially flat at the 
level that prevailed since late last year.  The pace of starts 
for multifamily units moved up in April and was faster 
than in the first quarter.  Sales of both new and existing 
homes rose in April. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to be relatively flat early in 
the second quarter after declining sharply in the previous 
quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft edged up in April, and forward-
looking indicators, such as new orders for these capital 
goods and recent readings from national and regional 
surveys of business conditions, suggested little change in 
business equipment spending in the near term.  Firms’ 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2016 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



nominal spending for nonresidential structures exclud-
ing drilling and mining was little changed, on net, in 
March and April.  The number of oil and gas rigs in op-
eration, an indicator of spending for structures in the 
drilling and mining sector, fell through late May but 
edged up in early June. 

Total real government purchases rose modestly in the 
first quarter and appeared to be increasing at about the 
same pace in the second quarter.  Nominal outlays for 
defense in April and May pointed to an increase in real 
federal purchases in the second quarter, after such pur-
chases had declined in the first quarter.  In contrast, real 
state and local government purchases seemed to be edg-
ing down in the second quarter; the payrolls of these 
governments were little changed, on net, in April and 
May, and their nominal spending for construction de-
clined in April. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substan-
tially in March, with a sharp decline in imports more than 
offsetting a fall in exports.  The March data, together 
with revised estimates for earlier months, suggested that 
real exports were about flat in the first quarter while im-
ports fell slightly.  In April, the deficit widened as im-
ports recovered somewhat, but it remained narrower 
than its first-quarter average. 

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased about 1 percent over the 
12 months ending in April, partly restrained by earlier 
declines in consumer energy prices.  Core PCE price in-
flation, which excludes changes in food and energy 
prices, was a little above 1½ percent over the same  
12-month period, held down in part by decreases in the 
prices of non-energy imports over much of this period 
and the pass-through of the declines in energy prices to 
prices of other goods and services.  Over the 12 months 
ending in April, total consumer prices as measured by 
the consumer price index (CPI) also rose about 1 per-
cent, while core CPI inflation was a little above 2 per-
cent.  The Michigan survey measure of longer-run infla-
tion expectations fell to its lowest level on record in early 
June, but other measures of such expectations—includ-
ing those from the Survey of Professional Forecasters 
and from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Sur-
vey of Market Participants—were generally little 
changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Foreign real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter, 
supported by relatively robust increases in Canada, the 
euro area, Japan, and Mexico.  However, the pace of 
growth appeared to slow in many foreign economies in 
the second quarter, although in some cases as a result of 

what were likely to be temporary disruptions, including 
wildfires in Canada and an earthquake in Japan.  In the 
United Kingdom, uncertainty about the outcome of the 
referendum on exit from the European Union seemed 
to be holding down investment.  In contrast, indicators 
for emerging Asia, including China, suggested that eco-
nomic growth picked up in the second quarter.  Inflation 
remained low in the advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs), in part reflecting previous declines in energy 
prices.  Inflation also continued to be subdued in most 
emerging market economies (EMEs). 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Domestic financial market conditions remained accom-
modative over the intermeeting period.  Equity price in-
dexes and corporate bond spreads were little changed, 
on net, and, in aggregate, corporations continued to tap 
credit markets at a solid pace.  Credit also remained 
broadly available to households, except for higher-risk 
borrowers in some markets.  The expected near-term 
path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes 
varied notably over the intermeeting period.  On bal-
ance, it flattened, largely in response to the disappointing 
May employment report and growing concerns among 
investors about the British referendum on membership 
in the European Union.  The flatter expected path of the 
federal funds rate, along with an apparent decline in 
global risk sentiment early in the period, contributed to 
an appreciable reduction in longer-term Treasury yields. 

Market-based estimates of the probability of a hike in the 
federal funds rate at the June FOMC meeting were vari-
able during the intermeeting period.  The probability of 
an increase in June fell to near zero in early May in re-
sponse to incoming economic data, jumped to about 
30 percent after the release of the April FOMC minutes 
and other Federal Reserve communications, and 
dropped again to near zero after the May employment 
report.  The expected path of the federal funds rate for 
the medium term implied by market quotes declined 
somewhat on net.  The average probability assigned by 
respondents to the Desk’s June Survey of Primary Deal-
ers and Survey of Market Participants was near zero for 
a rate hike in June and around 20 percent for a rate in-
crease in July.  The median respondent in each survey 
indicated that the most likely outcome was only one hike 
in 2016, down from two in the April surveys. 

The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened, on net, over 
the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting declines in 
longer-term rates; the flattening left the spread between 
yields on 2- and 10-year Treasury securities near its low-
est level since 2007.  Although a significant portion of 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the declines in yields occurred following the release of 
the May employment report, yields at longer maturities 
had begun drifting down earlier in the period, consistent 
with an apparent deterioration in global risk sentiment.  
Yields moved lower late in the period amid growing con-
cerns about the upcoming British referendum.  Some 
market participants attributed the decline in Treasury 
yields in part to heavy demand from foreign investors 
faced with extraordinarily low yields on foreign sover-
eign securities.  Inflation compensation based on Treas-
ury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) decreased, par-
ticularly at longer tenors.  Measures of inflation compen-
sation based on inflation swaps also declined, but less 
than TIPS-based measures, consistent with anecdotal re-
ports suggesting that a portion of the declines in TIPS-
based measures might have been driven by elevated de-
mand for longer-term nominal Treasury securities. 

Broad stock price indexes moved within narrow ranges 
but were modestly lower, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.  However, one-month-ahead option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—rose notably 
from fairly low levels and ended the period close to its 
historical median level.  Spreads of 10-year triple-B-rated 
corporate bond yields over those on comparable-ma-
turity Treasury securities were little changed on balance.  
High-yield spreads widened, mainly for firms outside of 
the energy sector; spreads on bonds for firms in the en-
ergy sector narrowed, likely in response to rising oil 
prices. 

Overall financing conditions for nonfinancial firms im-
proved a bit over the intermeeting period, remaining ac-
commodative.  Amid still-low yields, bond issuance by 
investment-grade corporations rose to a robust pace in 
May, and speculative-grade issuance also picked up.  
Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on 
banks’ books remained strong in April and May, partic-
ularly at large banks.  Following significant declines in 
the first quarter of 2016, gross issuance of leveraged 
loans increased slightly in April and May, as refinancing 
was reportedly boosted by lower loan spreads.  Equity 
issuance by nonfinancial firms through initial public of-
ferings remained subdued over the intermeeting period.  
Meanwhile, nonfinancial firms continued to repurchase 
their shares at a brisk pace in the first quarter, and divi-
dends stayed near record levels. 

Recent developments pointed to some decline in the 
credit quality of nonfinancial firms.  The percentage of 
C&I loans entering delinquency or being charged off in-
creased further in the first quarter, the default rate of 
corporate bonds moved up in April, and downgrades of 

nonfinancial bonds significantly outpaced upgrades in 
May.  Expected year-ahead default rates for nonfinancial 
firms remained moderately elevated relative to previous 
expansions, while those for oil companies continued to 
be high. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate re-
mained fairly accommodative.  All major categories of 
commercial real estate loans on banks’ books increased 
briskly during April and May.  However, spreads on 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stayed 
elevated, continuing to depress CMBS issuance. 

On balance, credit conditions in municipal bond markets 
continued to be stable.  Yield spreads on general obliga-
tion municipal bonds were little changed, and gross issu-
ance remained solid.  The default by Puerto Rico’s Gov-
ernment Development Bank on debt payments due in 
early May was widely expected and elicited limited reac-
tion in broader municipal bond markets. 

Conditions in consumer credit markets were little 
changed and generally remained accommodative.  Con-
sumer loan balances continued to increase at a robust 
pace in recent months, with year-over-year growth in 
credit card balances outstanding continuing to trend up-
ward.  Credit in mortgage markets stayed tight for bor-
rowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document in-
come, or high debt-to-income ratios.  Interest rates on 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined and continued to 
be low by historical standards. 

Over the intermeeting period, developments in global fi-
nancial markets were driven in large part by shifting 
views on the expected path of U.S. monetary policy and 
by fluctuating expectations about the outcome of the 
U.K. vote on membership in the European Union.  The 
exchange value of the U.S. dollar rose in the middle of 
the intermeeting period along with expectations for less 
accommodative Federal Reserve monetary policy.  How-
ever, the dollar partially retraced these increases follow-
ing the much weaker-than-expected U.S. employment 
report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against 
the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher 
against EME currencies.  In contrast to its changes 
against most currencies, the dollar depreciated against 
the Japanese yen, in large part because of the unexpected 
decision by the Bank of Japan not to ease policy further 
at its April meeting.  AFE sovereign yields declined, with 
U.K. yields in particular being weighed down following 
polls showing an increase in support for the “leave” vote 
in the upcoming referendum.  Decreases in equity in-
dexes in the AFEs, particularly in Europe, also report-

edly reflected concerns about the possibility of a success-
ful “leave” vote.  Most EME equity markets also edged 
lower. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for 
the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was esti-
mated to have been faster in the first quarter than in the 
April forecast, and the incoming information was con-
sistent with a moderate pickup in GDP growth in the 
second quarter.  Real GDP was projected to rise a little 
slower in the second half of this year than in the previous 
forecast and to increase at about the same pace thereaf-
ter; the small boosts to real GDP growth implied by a 
lower assumed path for interest rates and by a slightly 
stronger trajectory for home values were essentially off-
set by restraint from higher projected paths for the for-
eign exchange value of the dollar and for oil prices.  The 
staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand 
at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2016 
through 2018, supported primarily by increases in con-
sumer spending.  The unemployment rate was expected 
to remain relatively flat over the second half of the year 
and then to gradually decline further; over this period, 
the unemployment rate was projected to run somewhat 
below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from 
the previous projection.  The staff continued to project 
that inflation would increase over the next several years, 
as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports 
were expected to begin steadily rising this year.  How-
ever, inflation was still projected to be slightly below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2018. 

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its April projec-
tions for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  
The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted 
to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that 
neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to 
help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks.  
In addition, the staff continued to see the risks to the 
forecast from developments abroad as skewed to the 
downside.  Consistent with the downside risks to aggre-
gate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for 
the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks 
to the projection for inflation were still judged as 
weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that

conjunction with the June 2016 FOMC meeting. 

longer-term inflation expectations may have edged 
down. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-
flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 
2016 through 2018 and over the longer run.4  Each par-
ticipant’s projections were conditioned on his or her 
judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  The longer-
run projections represented each participant’s assess-
ment of the rate to which each variable would be ex-
pected to converge, over time, under appropriate mone-
tary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the 
economy.  These projections and policy assessments are 
described in the Summary of Economic Projections, 
which is an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the 
pace of improvement in the labor market had slowed 
while growth in economic activity appeared to have 
picked up.  Although the unemployment rate had de-
clined, job gains had diminished. Growth in household 
spending had strengthened.  Since the beginning of the 
year, the housing sector had continued to improve and 
the drag from net exports appeared to have lessened, but 
business fixed investment had been soft.  Inflation had 
continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Mar-
ket-based measures of inflation compensation declined; 
most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation ex-
pectations were little changed, on balance, in recent 
months. 

Participants generally expected that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
indicators would strengthen.  Inflation was expected to 
remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier 
declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over 
the medium term as the transitory effects of past de-
clines in energy and import prices dissipated and the la-
bor market strengthened further.  Participants generally 
agreed that the Committee should continue to closely 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



monitor inflation indicators and global economic and fi-
nancial developments. 

Growth of consumer spending appeared to have picked 
up from its slow pace in the first quarter.  Retail sales 
posted strong gains in April and May, and sales of light 
motor vehicles moved back up.  At the time of the April 
meeting, most participants had anticipated a rebound in 
consumer spending in light of the still-solid fundamental 
determinants of household spending.  Some participants 
indicated that consumption was likely to continue being 
supported by these factors, which included ongoing 
gains in income, robust household balance sheets, and 
the positive assessment of current economic conditions 
that was evident in recent surveys of consumers.  How-
ever, a few participants expressed caution about the out-
look for consumer expenditures, noting that slower in-
creases in employment and higher energy prices could 
restrain spending. 

The housing sector continued to improve since the be-
ginning of the year.  Reports from a number of partici-
pants indicated that single-family construction was 
strengthening and house prices were rising in most parts 
of their Districts.  However, some areas that were af-
fected by the slowdown in the energy sector experienced 
house price declines or increases in mortgage delin-
quency rates.  

Participants summarized survey readings and anecdotal 
reports on business conditions in their Districts.  Those 
indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic 
activity within the manufacturing sector.  Some of the 
weakness in manufacturing activity was linked to the ef-
fects of earlier declines in oil prices on firms in the en-
ergy sector and to previous increases in the exchange 
value of the dollar, which had adversely affected export-
ers.  But manufacturing activity was judged to have sta-
bilized in a couple of Districts, and contacts there were 
optimistic about further improvement in the months 
ahead.  It was noted that the recent increase in crude oil 
prices had improved the outlook for the energy sector.  
However, a couple of participants observed that finan-
cial strains caused by previous declines in energy prices 
had continued for firms or financial institutions in their 
Districts, and such difficulties were seen as likely to per-
sist absent further increases in energy prices.  Regarding 
the service sector, a few participants commented that ac-
tivity and hiring continued to expand in their Districts.  
The near-term outlook for farm income remained weak 
despite recent increases in the futures prices of some ag-
ricultural commodities. 

Available indicators suggested that the softness in busi-
ness fixed investment since late last year persisted early 
in the second quarter.  While weakness in the drilling and 
mining sector was attributable to the earlier declines in 
oil prices, participants identified a variety of potential 
causes of the broader weakness in investment spending, 
including a slowdown in corporate profits, concern 
about prospects for economic growth, heightened un-
certainty regarding the future course of domestic regula-
tory and fiscal policies, and a persistent reluctance on the 
part of firms to undertake new projects in the wake of 
the financial crisis.  Some participants mentioned that 
the sluggishness in business investment could portend a 
broader economic slowdown.  A couple of participants 
also noted that elevated inventory levels could be a drag 
on economic growth in the near term.  However, partic-
ipants also cited factors that could lead to a pickup in 
business spending, including the recent turnaround in 
energy prices and the greater optimism on the part of 
firms indicated by surveys of businesses and anecdotal 
reports in some Districts. 

The employment report for May showed considerably 
weaker growth in payrolls than had been expected, and 
gains in previous months were revised down.  Although 
the unemployment rate fell in May, a drop in labor force 
participation accounted for the decline.  Participants dis-
cussed a range of interpretations of these data.  Many 
participants observed that, because of transitory factors, 
such as statistical noise and the effects of a strike in the 
telecommunications industry, the reported rate of pay-
roll job growth likely understated its underlying pace; 
however, many participants thought that the underlying 
pace had slowed some from that of previous months.  
Some noted that other indicators did not corroborate a 
material weakening of labor market conditions.  These 
indicators included a number of regional surveys of la-
bor market conditions, relatively low levels of initial 
claims for unemployment insurance, surveys of business 
hiring plans, and positive views of labor market condi-
tions in recent consumer surveys.  In addition, a few par-
ticipants commented that the movements in labor force 
participation in recent months were, on balance, con-
sistent with its secular downtrend.  In contrast, some 
noted that the lower rate of payroll gains could instead 
be indicative of a broader slowdown in growth of eco-
nomic activity that was also evidenced by other down-
beat labor market indicators, such as a decline in the dif-
fusion indexes of industry payrolls, an increase in the 
number of workers reporting that they were working 
part time for economic reasons, or the recent sharp drop 
in labor force participation.  Finally, a few participants

suggested that the weak employment growth may in-
stead reflect supply constraints associated with a general 
tightening of labor market conditions.  These partici-
pants saw the rising trend in wages, business reports of 
reduced worker availability, and high rate of job open-
ings as supporting this interpretation.  Others thought it 
unlikely that such constraints would have become evi-
dent so abruptly. 

Almost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak 
May employment report increased their uncertainty 
about the outlook for the labor market.  Even so, many 
remarked that they were reluctant to change their out-
look materially based on one economic data release.  Par-
ticipants generally expected to see a resumption of 
monthly gains in payroll employment that would be suf-
ficient to promote continued strengthening of the labor 
market.  However, some noted that with labor market 
conditions at or near those consistent with maximum 
employment, it would be reasonable to anticipate that 
gains in payroll employment would soon moderate from 
the pace seen over the past few years. 

Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 per-
cent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier de-
clines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-
ports.  Core PCE price inflation registered an increase of 
1.6 percent for the 12 months ending in April, while re-
cent readings on retail energy prices moved up notably.  
Most participants expected to see continued progress to-
ward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  
They viewed the firming in some measures of core infla-
tion, the evidence that wage growth was picking up, the 
ongoing tightening of resource utilization, the recent 
firming in oil prices, and the stabilization of the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar this year as factors likely to 
boost inflation over time.  However, other participants 
were less confident that inflation would return to its tar-
get level over the medium term.  They thought that pro-
gress could be very slow, particularly in light of the like-
lihood that tighter resource utilization may impart only 
modest upward pressure on prices.  They also saw im-
portant downside risks, including persistent disinflation-
ary pressures from very low inflation and weak eco-
nomic growth abroad as well as the softening in some 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions and market-based measures of inflation compen-
sation. 

Global financial conditions had improved since earlier in 
the year, and recent data on net exports suggested that 
the drag on domestic economic activity from the exter-

nal sector had abated somewhat.  Still, participants gen-
erally agreed that global economic and financial devel-
opments should continue to be monitored closely.  
Some participants indicated that prospects for economic 
activity in many foreign economies appeared to be sub-
dued, that global inflation and interest rates remained 
very low by historical standards, and that recurring bouts 
of global financial market instability remained a risk.  
Most participants noted that the upcoming British refer-
endum on membership in the European Union could 
generate financial market turbulence that could ad-
versely affect domestic economic performance.  Some 
also noted that continued uncertainty regarding the out-
look for China’s foreign exchange policy and the rela-
tively high levels of debt in China and some other EMEs 
represented appreciable risks to global financial stability 
and economic performance. 

In light of participants’ updates to their economic pro-
jections, they discussed their current assessments of the 
appropriate trajectory of monetary policy over the me-
dium term.  Most still expected that the appropriate tar-
get range for the federal funds rate associated with their 
projections of further progress toward the Committee’s 
statutory objectives would rise gradually in coming years.  
However, some noted that their forecasts were now con-
sistent with a shallower path than they had expected at 
the time of the March meeting.  Many participants com-
mented that the level of the federal funds rate consistent 
with maintaining trend economic growth—the so-called 
neutral rate—appeared to be lower currently or was 
likely to be lower in the longer run than they had esti-
mated earlier.  While recognizing that the longer-run 
neutral rate was highly uncertain, many judged that it 
would likely remain low relative to historical standards, 
held down by factors such as slow productivity growth 
and demographic trends.  Several noted that in the pre-
vailing circumstances of considerable uncertainty about 
the neutral federal funds rate, the Committee could bet-
ter gauge the effects of increases in the federal funds rate 
on the economy if it proceeded gradually in adjusting 
policy. 

Participants weighed a number of considerations in as-
sessing the conditions under which it would be appro-
priate to increase the target range for the federal funds 
rate.  Most participants indicated that they made only 
small changes to their forecasts for achieving and main-
taining the Committee’s objectives of maximum em-
ployment and 2 percent inflation over the medium term.  
Several noted that the fundamentals underlying their 
forecasts remained solid, with several mentioning, in 
particular, that financial conditions were accommodative 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



and household balance sheets had improved.  In evalu-
ating recent economic information, participants gener-
ally agreed that it was advisable to avoid overreacting to 
one or two labor market reports; however, the implica-
tions of the recent data on labor market conditions for 
the economic outlook were uncertain.  Most judged that 
they would need to accumulate additional information 
on the labor market, production, and spending to help 
clarify how the economy was evolving in order to evalu-
ate whether the stance of monetary policy should be ad-
justed.  In addition, participants generally thought that it 
would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the upcom-
ing referendum in the United Kingdom on membership 
in the European Union in order to assess the conse-
quences of the vote for global financial market condi-
tions and the U.S. economic outlook. 

Most participants judged that, in the absence of signifi-
cant economic or financial shocks, raising the target 
range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate if 
incoming information confirmed that economic growth 
had picked up, that job gains were continuing at a pace 
sufficient to sustain progress toward the Committee’s 
maximum-employment objective, and that inflation was 
likely to rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  Some 
participants viewed a broad range of labor market indi-
cators as well as the recent firming in wages as consistent 
with a high level of labor utilization.  They also pointed 
out that core inflation had begun to move up and that 
the transitory factors that had been holding down head-
line inflation were receding.  Several of these participants 
expressed concern that a delay in resuming further grad-
ual increases in the federal funds rate would increase the 
risks to financial stability or would raise the potential for 
overshooting the Committee’s objectives; such an over-
shooting might require a rapid removal of policy accom-
modation at some point in the future, which could entail 
significant risks for U.S. financial markets and the econ-
omy. 

However, some other participants were uncertain 
whether economic conditions would soon warrant an in-
crease in the target range for the federal funds rate.  Sev-
eral of them noted downside risks to the outlook for 
growth in economic activity and for further improve-
ment in labor market conditions, including the possibil-
ity that the sharp slowdown in employment gains and 
the continued weakness in business fixed investment sig-
naled a downshift in economic growth, as well as the po-
tential for global economic or financial shocks.  Moreo-
ver, several of them worried about the declines in 
measures of inflation compensation and in some survey-
based measures of inflation expectations and suggested 

that monetary policy may need to remain accommoda-
tive for some time in order to move inflation closer to 
2 percent on a sustained basis.  A few pointed out that 
with inflation likely to remain low for some time and to 
rise only gradually, maintaining an accommodative 
stance of policy could extend the strengthening of the 
labor market.  In addition, several participants observed 
that because short-term interest rates were still near zero, 
monetary policy could, if necessary, respond more effec-
tively to surprisingly strong inflationary pressures in the 
future than to a weakening in the labor market and fall-
ing inflation. 

A number of participants emphasized that the Commit-
tee’s approach to policy-setting was necessarily data de-
pendent given the uncertainties associated with medium-
term forecasts of economic activity and, accordingly, 
with the appropriate policy path over the medium term.  
It was noted that their expectations for the federal funds 
rate did not represent a preset plan and could change as 
incoming information influenced their views of the eco-
nomic outlook and the risks associated with it.  Several 
participants expressed concern that the Committee’s 
communications had not been fully effective in inform-
ing the public how incoming information affected the 
Committee’s view of the economic outlook, its degree 
of confidence in the outlook, or the implications for the 
trajectory of monetary policy. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their consideration of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in April indicated that the pace 
of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed 
in recent months while growth in economic activity ap-
peared to have picked up from the low rates recorded in 
the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  
Although the unemployment rate had declined over the 
intermeeting period, job gains had diminished.  After 
only a modest increase early in the year, growth in house-
hold spending had strengthened in recent months.  Since 
the beginning of the year, the housing sector had contin-
ued to improve and the drag from net exports had less-
ened, but business fixed investment had been soft.  In-
flation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices 
and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation declined over the 
intermeeting period; most survey-based measures of in-
flation expectations were little changed. 

With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-
tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2016 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market indicators would strengthen.  
Most members made only small changes to their fore-
casts for economic activity and the labor market.  Most 
judged it appropriate to avoid overweighting one or two 
labor market reports in their consideration of the eco-
nomic outlook, but they indicated that the recent slow-
ing in payroll employment gains had increased their un-
certainty about the likely pace of improvements in the 
labor market going forward.  Many noted that the slow-
down could be a temporary aberration and that other la-
bor market indicators—such as new claims for unem-
ployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and read-
ings on consumers’ perceptions of the labor market—
remained positive.  Some of them judged that labor mar-
ket conditions were now at or close to the Committee’s 
objectives and pointed out that some moderation in em-
ployment gains was to be expected when such condi-
tions were near those consistent with maximum employ-
ment.  However, other members observed that the re-
cent soft readings on payroll jobs as well as the decline 
in the labor force participation rate and the absence of 
further reductions in the number of individuals who 
were working part time for economic reasons in recent 
months suggested a possible downshift in the pace of 
improvement in the labor market. 

An additional factor in the Committee’s policy delibera-
tions was the upcoming U.K. referendum on member-
ship in the European Union.  Members noted the con-
siderable uncertainty about the outcome of the vote and 
its potential economic and financial market conse-
quences.  They indicated that they would closely monitor 
developments associated with the referendum as well as 
other global economic and financial developments that 
could affect the U.S. outlook. 

Members expected inflation to remain low in the near 
term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, 
but most anticipated that inflation would rise to 2 per-
cent over the medium term as the transitory effects of 
past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and 
the labor market strengthened further.  Although head-
line inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 
objective, some members observed that core inflation 
had risen, and one member noted that the annual rate of 
increase in core PCE inflation in the first quarter had 
exceeded 2 percent.  However, several others continued 
to see downside risks to inflation, citing the decline in 
inflation expectations and the risk of adverse shocks to 
U.S. economic activity from developments abroad.  In 
light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, 

the Committee agreed to continue carefully monitoring 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. 

After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncer-
tainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to 
leave the target range for the federal funds rate un-
changed at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting.  Members 
generally agreed that, before assessing whether another 
step in removing monetary accommodation was war-
ranted, it was prudent to wait for additional data regard-
ing labor market conditions as well as information that 
would allow them to assess the consequences of the 
U.K. vote for global financial conditions and the U.S. 
economic outlook.  They judged that their decisions 
about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate in 
coming months would depend importantly on whether 
incoming information corroborated the Committee’s ex-
pectations for economic activity, the labor market, and 
inflation.  Some of them emphasized that, with labor 
market conditions and inflation at or close to the Com-
mittee’s objectives, taking another step in removing 
monetary accommodation should not be delayed too 
long.  However, a couple of members underscored that 
they would need to accumulate sufficient evidence to in-
crease their confidence that economic growth was 
strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock 
to demand and that inflation was moving closer to 2 per-
cent on a sustained basis. 

Members reiterated that, in determining the timing and 
size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and 
expected economic conditions relative to its objectives 
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This 
assessment would take into account a wide range of in-
formation, including measures of labor market condi-
tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments.  The Committee expected that economic 
conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and the 
federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer 
run.  Members emphasized that the actual path of the 
federal funds rate would depend on the economic out-
look as informed by incoming data.  In that regard, they 
judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy 
options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the 
stance of policy based on how incoming information af-
fected the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation as well 
as the risks to the outlook.

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-
pated doing so until normalization of the federal funds 
rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Com-
mittee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable lev-
els, should help maintain accommodative financial con-
ditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective June 16, 2016, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse 
repurchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, 
in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such 
operations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk 
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-
actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of 
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed 
securities transactions.” 

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in April indicates that 
the pace of improvement in the labor market 
has slowed while growth in economic activity 
appears to have picked up.  Although the 
unemployment rate has declined, job gains have 

diminished.  Growth in household spending has 
strengthened.  Since the beginning of the year, 
the housing sector has continued to improve 
and the drag from net exports appears to have 
lessened, but business fixed investment has 
been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below 
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, 
partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices 
and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation 
declined; most survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance, in recent months. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The 
Committee currently expects that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, 
economic activity will expand at a moderate 
pace and labor market indicators will 
strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low 
in the near term, in part because of earlier 
declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent 
over the medium term as the transitory effects 
of past declines in energy and import prices 
dissipate and the labor market strengthens 
further.  The Committee continues to closely 
monitor inflation indicators and global 
economic and financial developments. 

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting further improvement in 
labor market conditions and a return to 
2 percent inflation. 

In determining the timing and size of future 
adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 
2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take 
into account a wide range of information, 
including measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readings on financial and 
international developments.  In light of the 
current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and 
expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The

Committee expects that economic conditions 
will evolve in a manner that will warrant only 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data. 

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by 
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help 
maintain accommodative financial conditions.” 

Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer,

Esther L. George, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, 
Eric Rosengren, and Daniel K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 26–27, 
2016.  The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on June 15, 
2016.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 14–15, 2016, meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each 
year from 2016 to 2018 and over the longer run.1  Each 
participant’s projection was based on information avail-
able at the time of the meeting, together with his or her 
assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assump-
tions about the factors likely to affect economic out-
comes.  The longer-run projections represent each par-
ticipant’s assessment of the value to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” 
is defined as the future path of policy that each partici-
pant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic 
activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual 
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of 
maximum employment and stable prices. 

FOMC participants generally expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) this year, next year, and in 2018 would 
be at or quite close to their individual estimates of GDP 
growth over the longer run.  All but a few participants 
projected that the unemployment rate at the end of this 
year will be at or below its longer-run normal rate and 
expected it to edge lower next year.  For 2018, nearly all 
participants expected the unemployment rate to be at or 
a bit below its longer-run level.  Almost all participants 
projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter 
percentage change in the price index for personal con-
sumption expenditures (PCE), would increase this year 
and over the next two years, and most expected inflation 
to have converged to the Committee’s objective of 
2 percent by 2018.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide sum-
mary statistics for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected 
that it would be appropriate for the target range for the 
federal funds rate to rise gradually as the economy stead-
ily progresses toward the Committee’s longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  In-
deed, participants generally judged that the federal funds 
rate in 2018 would still be below their estimates of its

conjunction with the June 2016 FOMC meeting.  

longer-run rate.  However, because the economic out-
look is inherently uncertain, participants’ assessments of 
appropriate policy were also uncertain and likely would 
change in response to revisions to their economic out-
looks and associated risks. 

Participants generally viewed the level of uncertainty as-
sociated with their individual forecasts for economic 
growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar 
to the norms of the previous 20 years.  Most participants 
also judged the risks around their projections for eco-
nomic activity and inflation as broadly balanced, al-
though many participants saw the risks to their GDP 
growth and inflation forecasts as weighted to the down-
side.  In addition, some participants viewed the risks to 
their forecasts of the unemployment rate as tilted to the 
upside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-
sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 
2 percent for each year from 2016 through 2018, the 
same as the median of their projections of the longer-
run GDP growth rate.  However, a majority of partici-
pants expected that real GDP growth would pick up a 
bit in 2017 from this year’s pace, and most expected it to 
remain at or above their estimates of its longer-run pace 
in 2018.  Participants pointed to a number of factors that 
they expected would contribute to moderate output 
growth over the next few years, including a diminution 
of the drag on net exports from a strong dollar, the con-
tinued improvements in household and business balance 
sheets, accommodative financial conditions, and some-
what more supportive fiscal policy. 

Participants’ median projections for real GDP growth in 
2016 and 2017 were slightly lower than the medians 
shown in the March 2016 Summary of Economic Pro-
jections (SEP).  Participants who lowered their projec-
tions for near-term GDP growth generally attributed 
their revisions to weaker-than-expected growth in the 
first quarter and soft readings on economic activity in 
recent months, particularly those on business spending.  
Although several participants also reduced their fore-
casts for real GDP growth in 2018 and in the longer run,

those downward revisions did not alter the median fore-
casts. 

The median of projections for the unemployment rate 
edged down from 4.7 percent at the end of 2016 to 
4.6 percent in 2017 and remained at that level in 2018, 
modestly below the median assessment of the longer-
run normal unemployment rate of 4.8 percent.  The me-
dians and ranges of the unemployment rate projections 
for 2016 to 2018 were nearly unchanged from March. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2016 through 2018 and in the longer 
run.  The distribution of individual projections of GDP 
growth for 2016 shifted lower relative to the distribution 
of the March projections.  The distributions of projec-
tions for GDP growth over the next two years and in the 
longer run also shifted down.  For this year and next, the 
distributions of projections for the unemployment rate 
were little changed, while the distribution for 2018 be-
came less dispersed. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
In the June SEP, the median of projections for headline 
PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1.4 percent, a bit higher 
than in March.  Many participants pointed to stronger-
than-expected readings on inflation early this year, as 
well as to the recent stabilization of oil prices, as factors 
contributing to the upward revision to their inflation 
projections.  The projections for headline PCE price in-
flation over the next two years and in the longer run were 
little changed since March, with the median inflation 
projection still rising to 1.9 percent in 2017 and to the 
Committee’s objective of 2 percent in 2018.  Almost all 
participants projected that inflation will be within 
0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective by 
2018.  The median of individual projections for core 
PCE price inflation also increases gradually over the next 
two years.   

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The distribution of projections for headline PCE 
price inflation for this year shifted up relative to projec-
tions for the March meeting.  The distribution of projec-
tions for core PCE price inflation this year also moved 

2 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed 
by the view that there are multiple possible medium-term re-
gimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, 
and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way that  
 

to the right on balance.  For 2017 and 2018, the distri-
butions of projections for both total and core PCE price 
inflation were nearly unchanged. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 
2018 and over the longer run.2  The distributions for 
2016 to 2018 and for the longer run shifted to the left.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate rises 
gradually from 0.88 percent at the end of 2016 to 
1.63 percent at the end of 2017 and 2.38 percent at the 
end of 2018; the median for the longer-run projections 
of the federal funds rate is 3 percent.  Although the me-
dian federal funds rate at the end of 2016 was unchanged 
from the March projection, a majority of participants re-
vised down their projections for that year, most by 
0.25 percentage point.  For 2017 and 2018, the median 
projections were 0.25 percentage point and 0.62 percent-
age point lower, respectively, than in March.  

Compared with the March SEP, the median of partici-
pants’ projections for the federal funds rate in the longer 
run moved down 0.25 percentage point.  This change 
reflected downward revisions by about half of the par-
ticipants. 

Participants’ projections for the path of the federal funds 
rate represented their individual assessments of appro-
priate monetary policy consistent with their projections 
of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other 
factors.  In discussing their June forecasts, many partici-
pants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds 
rate over the next several years would need to be gradual 
in light of a short-term neutral interest rate that was cur-
rently low—a phenomenon that several participants at-
tributed to the persistence of factors that restrained 
spending over recent years—and that was likely to rise 
only slowly as the effects of those factors faded over 
time.  Some participants noted the proximity of short-
term nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound 
as limiting the Committee’s ability to increase monetary 
accommodation to counter adverse shocks to the econ-
omy should they occur.  They judged that, as a result, the 
Committee should take a cautious approach to monetary 

cannot be forecast.  Under this view, the economy currently is 
in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity 
with low productivity growth and a low short-term real inter-
est rate, but longer-term outcomes cannot be usefully pro-
jected.

policy normalization.  Participants cited a number of fac-
tors that pushed down their projections of the longer-
run rate, including domestic and global demographic 
trends and weak productivity growth, which together 
imply a slower pace of trend output growth. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
The left-hand column of figure 4 shows that all but a few 
participants judged the levels of uncertainty around their 
June projections for real GDP growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and headline and core PCE price inflation to 
be broadly similar to the average levels of the past 
20 years.3  A few participants saw the uncertainty about 
GDP growth as higher than its historical average, up 
from only one in March.  These participants cited the 
surprisingly weak productivity growth of recent years or 
the continuing fragile nature of the global economic en-
vironment as supporting such a view.  Most participants’ 
assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their 
economic projections did not change materially from 
March. 

As in March, most participants judged the risks to their 
projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate 
to be broadly balanced, although many still assessed the 
risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside and 
some saw the risks to the unemployment rate as tilted to 
the upside (top two panels in the right-hand column of 
figure 4).  Participants who saw the risks to growth as 
tilted to the downside attributed this assessment to the 
weaker-than-expected May employment report; recent 
softness in business fixed investment; concerns about 
the global economic environment, including possible 
economic and financial consequences of the upcoming 
British referendum on European Union membership; or 
the proximity of short-term nominal interest rates to the 

effective lower bound.  A majority of participants judged 
the risks to their inflation projections to be broadly bal-
anced.  However, many viewed the risks to inflation as 
skewed to the downside, although fewer than in March.  
A couple of participants pointed to the firming of some 
measures of inflation in recent months as contributing 
to the change in their risk assessment.  Among those 
who continued to judge that the risks to inflation were 
weighted to the downside, almost all cited recent de-
clines in measures of inflation compensation and some 
survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-
tions as reasons for that assessment.

Forecast Uncertainty 

 
The economic projections provided by the 

members of the Board of Governors and the pres-
idents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform dis-
cussions of monetary policy among policymakers 
and can aid public understanding of the basis for 
policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends 
these projections, however.  The economic and 
statistical models and relationships used to help 
produce economic forecasts are necessarily imper-
fect descriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in 
setting the stance of monetary policy, participants 
consider not only what appears to be the most 
likely economic outcome as embodied in their 
projections, but also the range of alternative pos-
sibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical ac-
curacy of a range of forecasts, including those re-
ported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those 
prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in 
advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market 
Committee.  The projection error ranges shown in 
the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, 
suppose a participant projects that real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices 
will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attend-
ing those projections is similar to that experienced 
in the past and the risks around the projections are 
broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 
would imply a probability of about 70 percent that 
actual GDP would expand within a range of 
1.6   to  4.4  percent  in  the  current  year,  1.0  to  

5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.8 to 5.2 per-
cent in the third year.  The corresponding 70 per-
cent confidence intervals for overall inflation would 
be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second and third years. 

Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, par-
ticipants provide judgments as to whether the un-
certainty attached to their projections of each vari-
able is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar 
to typical levels of forecast uncertainty in the past, 
as shown in table 2.  Participants also provide judg-
ments as to whether the risks to their projections 
are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, partic-
ipants judge whether each variable is more likely to 
be above or below their projections of the most 
likely outcome.  These judgments about the uncer-
tainty and the risks attending each participant’s 
projections are distinct from the diversity of partic-
ipants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks as-
sociated with a particular projection rather than 
with divergences across a number of different pro-
jections. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook 
for the future path of the federal funds rate is sub-
ject to considerable uncertainty.  This uncertainty 
arises primarily because each participant’s assess-
ment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy 
depends importantly on the evolution of real activ-
ity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions 
evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments 
of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate 
would change from that point forward.
