MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Major deposit and reserve aggregates contracted signifi-
cantly further in July, and interest rates remained generally at high
levels. Most recently, however, both short- and long-term rates have
turned down, as signs of more moderate credit demands have developed in
some sectors and market opinion that the peak in yields may have passed
has strengthened somewhat. Final action on the income surtax--at least
for the calendar 1969 segment--contributed to this changed expectation.
Also, markets were generally strengthened by the Treasury's decision to
follow a conservative approach in its August refinancing. Yields on
longer-tern debt securities have declined 1/8 - 1/4 of a percentage
point from their recent highs; and short-term rates--apart from day-to-
day money rates--are generally down 1/8 - 1/2 of a percentage point from
(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate rose to a peak of around
financing. Since then, it has declined, and in the first week of August
fluctuated around 7 per cent. Demands for Treasury bills have been quite
strong. Reinvestment of funds released through retirement of the maturing
CCC special certificates has recently contributed to these demands, along
with stepped-up cash flows to the auto companies during the early part of
the model change-over period. With market anticipations of somewhat lower
rates tending to strengthen, the 7.82 per cent yield set by the Treasury
on the single (18 month) note offered in the August refinancing proved
to be highly attractive.
(3) In the latter part of July, the tendency for rates in
securities markets to edge down was abetted by a coincident easing of
day-to-day money market rates. In the two weeks following the last
Committee meeting, the effective rate on Federal funds averaged around
the three preceding statement weeks. This moderation of pressures on
Federal funds reflected a skewing of reserve distribution in favor of
banks at money centers. At New York City banks, in particular, the
basic reserve deficit dropped to a very low average level. Since the
end of July, however, day-to-day money rates have tightened, raising the
average effective rate on Federal funds to more than 9-1/2 per cent; and
in recent days trading has frequently been at 10 per cent or above. The
reasons behind this firming are not entirely clear. It is possible that
recent Federal Reserve regulatory actions and administrative pressures
on repetitive borrowers at the discount window may have increased demand
for Federal funds at a time when country bank reserve positions have come
under increased pressure as a result of widespread deposit losses.
(4) Net borrowed reserves of member banks in the last 3
statement weeks have averaged about $1.0 billion, little changed from
the preceding 3-week period. Average member bank borrowings from the
Federal Reserve dropped slightly to $1.2 billion in the latest period.
But borrowings by country banks have risen by about $100 million between
the two periods to an average of about $660 million, as monetary restraint
has spread more widely.
(5) The recent declines in security market rates occurred
despite a sharp further contraction of commercial bank deposits during
July. This shrinkage continued to center on large time CD's, which
dropped by $1.8 billion. But attrition also persisted in other time and
savings deposits, as the still high market rates continued to stimulate
further savings withdrawals during the post-interest crediting period.
Reflecting in part transfers out of U.S. Government deposits, the money
supply rose at a 6 per cent annual rate in July, after correcting for the
bias introduced by the deduction of cash items associated with the in-
creasing volume of Euro-dollar transactions. The upward adjustment for
July was around 2-1/2 percentage points. In the second quarter, the
money supply growth rate has been revised upward by 2 percentage points
to a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate. Upward revisions in the rate of change
of total member bank deposits will be much less marked because of the
larger total amount of such deposits.
(6) Reflecting the heavy time deposit contraction of July,
total member bank deposits are estimated to have declined at a 21.5 per
cent annual rate, substantially more than was projected four weeks ago.
Similarly, total reserves declined during July at a nearly 30 per cent
annual rate. Adjustment of the deposit data for Euro-dollar borrowings
from foreign branches lessened the decline in the adjusted proxy to a
projected in the last Blue Book.
(7) With Euro-dollar borrowings thur offsetting only a part
of the further shrinkage in bank deposits, major money market banks con-
tinued to move aggressively to attract funds from other non-deposit
sources. It is estimates these non-deposit sources in July rose by
about the equivalent of 4 - 5 percentage points on the proxy, or somewhat
more than earlier anticipated. This includes borrowings by head offices
of banks through repurchase agreements and through funds obtained outside
the U.S. (other than from branches), and by affiliates through issuance
of commercial paper.
(8) The following table summarizes the changes in major
deposit and reserve aggregates for the last half of 1968 and thus far
in 1969.

Prospective developments
(9) After taking account of the relatively wide range of
fluctuation in the Federal funds rate over the past four weeks, maintenance
of prevailing firm conditions in the money market may be considered to
entail a Federal funds rate averaging around 9 per cent, member bank
borrowings in a $1 - $1-1/2 billion range, and net borrowed reserves
around $1 billion. However, the relationships that actually develop
between the Federal funds rate and marginal reserve measures (as well as
between these and credit conditions more generally) will depend in part
on how banks adjust to the new Federal Reserve regulations as they become
effective. In view of the highly concentrated impact of these regulations
on a relatively few banks, it seems likely that these banks will increase
their demands on the Federal funds market, and also at times the discount
window. The redefinition of instruments to be classed as deposits subject
to reserves to include bills payable and London drafts has already become
effective. The exemption for loans sold under repurchase agreements from
Regulations Q and D will be phasing out. Final action has not yet been
taken on Euro-dollar reserve requirements and the proposed more restricted
definition of Federal funds transactions.
(10) The redefinition of deposits to include such items as
bills payable and London checks is expected to increase required reserves
in the week ending August 20 by about $450 million. This redefinition
has probably contributed to the recent lessening of pressure on short-
term Euro-dollar rates. With respect to repurchase agreements, all
outstanding agreements written after July 25 will become subject to
Regulations Q and D on August 28. It is not expected that there will
be much if any of the newly written RP's outstanding after late August
(and thus no significant increase in required reserves). However
that may be, banks' behavior toward alternative sources of funds and
their own loans and investments is probably already in the process of
change in view of the prospective decline in RP's against loans as a
continuing source of funds; about $1.3 billion of such RP's sold to
nonbanks were outstanding toward the end of July and will run off over
time, tending to reduce bank credit by an equivalent amount. Moreover,
the proposed changes with respect to Euro-dollars and Federal funds,
while not yet effective, may have already begun to have a marginal impact
on bank attitudes.
(11) If money market conditions are not to be allowed to
tighten, one would expect open market operations to accommodate the
increase in required reserves generated by these recent regulatory
changes. Even if reserves are provided in full, however, there will
still be some reduction of commercial bank liquidity (even assuming
that the level of bank deposits is unaffected by the increased cost of
funds to banks) as banks in effect exchange earning assets with the
Federal Reserve for the needed reserves. In light of this, and taking
into account the erosion of RP's as a source of funds, it might be
necessary to supply reserves in a slightly higher than a one-for-one
ratio if increased tensions in bank financing positions are to be avoided.
(12) Apart from technical operations to accommodate required
reserves, it is not clear how active System open market operations will
have to be if the Federal funds rate is to be below the 9-1/2 - 10-1/2
per cent range of recent days. In part, this will depend on the extent
to which individual banks become more willing to borrow from the discount
window in adjusting to new regulations. Any such increase in borrowing,
however, should only be temporary, assuming continued normal operation of
the window, and would likely be accompanied by strong demands for Federal
funds. Under the circumstances, if over-all credit conditions are not
to become more restrictive, it is probable that some moderation in the
recent downward pressure on total and nonborrowed reserves will be
needed. And, assuming banks do not become fundamentally more able or
willing to borrow at the discount window, it may well be that net borrowed
reserves and member bank borrowings will have to be toward the low end
of the ranges specified in paragraph (9) for the over-all constellation
of money market conditions to remain about unchanged on balance.
(13) Against the background of the money market conditions
and factors affecting them described in the preceding paragraphs, the
the next four weeks. Some upward pressure on the bill rate may be
generated by bank adjustments to the new regulations, by further offer-
ings of Federal Agency issues, and by the expected Treasury cash
offering in late August. But System operations, as noted earlier, may
expected to be quite moderate in size (perhaps around $1-1/2 - $2
billion) and in the Treasury bill area. A basic factor influencing bill
rates, as well as longer-term rates, over the next few weeks will be the
state of market expectations. If tentative recent attitudes to the
effect that market interest rates are beginning to turn down become
stronger, it is likely that dealers will be willing to build up positions
and thereby provide some downward impetus to interest rates. These
attitudes, however, will be importantly influenced by dealer financing
costs, which have recently risen, as well as by the fundamental economic
(14) Given continuance of the current relatively high
structure of market interest rates and taut lending conditions at banks,
the recent pattern of sluggish loan growth at banks is likely to continue.
In part, this would appear to reflect supply constraints. But it may
also be a harbinger of cyclical reductions in demand, assuming that
business corporations have about passed through the recent phase of
rapid expansion in capital outlays.
and
(15) With both demand/supply factors holding down loan
growth, demand deposits are likely to contract in a 3 - 6 per cent,
annual rate, range in August. The money stock will probably decline
in a 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate range as currency in circulation
continues to grow.1/ U.S. Government deposits are also expected to
decline somewhat on average.
(16) Market interest rates will continue to exert a strong
pull on CD's and other time and savings deposits at banks. Consumer-
type time deposits are not expected to show any very significant recovery
from the large July net outflow. And attrition of CD's in August is
likely to continue given present ceiling rates, although slowing to
about $1 billionas amounts maturing are reduced.
(17) Member bank deposits will continue to decline relatively
sharply in August, though the decline should be considerably less than
that of July, and total reserves outstanding will also be reduced. The
decline in total member bank deposits may be in a 10 - 13 per cent,
annual rate, range. Euro-dollar borrowings through branches are not
expected to show much buoyancy, and may add about a percentage point
or so to member bank deposits in the absence of any major change in the
supply of funds abroad. The behavior of nondeposit sources of funds is
quite conjectural. Some, such as loan RP's, are likely to be contracting
fairly sharply as the month progresses. But issuance of commercial paper
by affiliates of banks is likely to continue, with the rapidity of the
increase depending in part on the intensity and incidence of credit
demands. All in all, however, we do not believe that the total of non-
deposit sources will rise as rapidly in August as in July.
A Policy Alternative
(18) If the Committee wishes to consider somewhat less
restrictive money market conditions as a policy alternative, such
conditions might include a Federal funds rate fluctuating around 8-1/2 per
cent, member bank borrowings ranging between $900 million and $1.1 billion,
and net borrowed reserves in a range $100 - $200 million lower. The
persistence of such money market conditions may be expected to tilt market
expectations toward further anticipation of lower interest rates in the
future. And as dealers and others become more willing to position
securities, both short- and long-term interest rates are likely to
decline. But given the extent to which banks will have to adjust to
new regulatory provisions, the decline in short-term interest rates may
be of relatively modest proportions. Still, the 3-month bill rate may
move down into a 6-1/2 - 6-7/8 per cent range.
(19) The market interest rate movement anticipated with a
modest easing of money market conditions is not likely to proceed to
the point where time deposits at banks become significantly more
competitive under existing Regulation Q ceilings. Thus CD attrition
in August is not likely to slow more than noted earlier. And there is
little reason to expect a significant growth pattern to develop in other
time deposits. Nor is the money supply likely to show appreciably
greater strength. The additional reserves provided through nonborrowed
reserves to attain the alternative money market conditions are likely to
be partly absorbed by reduced member bank borrowing, with a resulting
relatively small net effect on total reserves or on deposits--perhaps,
say, a percentage point or so.
(20) To have a significant effect on deposits would probably
require a change in Regulation Q ceilings and/or some further easing
of money market conditions over time. As the market became more
certain of the course of monetary policy, individual banks would be
encouraged to re-enter the securities market, thus tending to generate
new deposit balances at declining market interest rates. Time deposits
would become more competitive. The demand for money should also tend
to increase as interest rates go down, but this effect might well be
outweighed by a weakening in transactions demand for cash if growth in
GNP slows further as expected.
