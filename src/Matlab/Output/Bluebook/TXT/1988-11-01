MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Since the September FOMC meeting, reserve paths have con-
tinued to specify adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $600 million.
Over the two complete maintenance periods since the meeting, borrowing
averaged about $630 million, with borrowing in the first period well
above the targeted level, boosted by unexpectedly strong demands for
excess reserves. Federal funds have averaged around the upper end of
the 8 to 8-1/4 percent range expected to be associated with the borrow-
ing objective. Early in the intermeeting period, this firmness partly
reflected pressures related to the quarter-end. More recently demands
for discount window credit have been weaker than expected. In part this
may reflect some reluctance by larger banks to tap discount credit as a
consequence of unusually heavy borrowing on several successive settle-
ments Wednesdays. In addition discount window usage by smaller banks
has been quite light in October, perhaps in association with reduced
needs for this source of liquidity; credit growth at these banks is
estimated to have slackened, while household deposits have continued to
expand and Treasury note balances have remained at unusually high
levels. The weaker demand for discount credit seems to have persisted
through recent days, with borrowing averaging $440 million in the first
eight days of the current maintenance period and federal funds still
trading around 8-1/4 percent, about 1/8 percentage point above the
average in the weeks leading up to the September FOMC meeting. Seasonal

by prorating averages for two-week reserve maintenance periods that overlap
Reserve data incorporate adjustments for discontinuities associated with
in reserve requirements.
borrowing has averaged about $300 million in the current period, down
from peak levels of around $430 million a few weeks ago. Total reserves
contracted at about a 2 percent annual rate over September and October
as a drop in required reserves more than offset some increase in excess
reserves, but the monetary base expanded at about a 5-1/2 percent rate,
buoyed by continued moderate growth in currency.
(2) Other short-term interest rates generally climbed 10 to 25
basis points over the intermeeting period, perhaps reflecting the firmer
federal funds rate as well as increased supplies of Treasury bills and
CDs. Bond yields, though, declined somewhat in response to lower oil
prices and the incoming economic data, which were seen by market par-
ticipants as indicating moderate growth and reduced risk of greater
inflation and Federal Reserve tightening. However, rates on many cor-
porate bond issues subsequently rose substantially following announce-
ments of the Kraft and RJR Nabisco buyouts as investors reacted to
concerns about further leveraging. The shift in preference away from
bonds issued by companies now thought vulnerable to restructuring con-
tributed to lower rates on bonds of other issuers, including utilities,
financial corporations, sponsored agencies, and the Treasury. The
recent passage of legislation permitting renewed issuance of Treasury
bonds led to a small backup in yields on such securities, but on balance
Treasury bond rates are down about a quarter of a percentage point over
the period. The merger announcements, along with the drop in yields on
most bonds, tended to boost stock price indexes, which rose 2 percent or
so over the intermeeting period.
(3) The dollar's exchange value against G-10 currencies de-
clined by 4-1/2 percent since the last Committee meeting. The decline
in the dollar from its summer peak has been relatively orderly,
the dollar still remains 5 percent above its average of last December.
The recent decline was in response to indications of more moderate U.S.
economic growth and to information suggesting that U.S. external ad-
justment may not be proceeding as rapidly as had been thought. Short-
term interest rates abroad were little changed on balance, though in
recent days they have edged down in Germany and Japan. Long-term rates
declined by nearly 1/2 percentage point in Japan and around 1/4 percent-
age point in Germany, influenced by lower oil prices and by reduced
prospects for monetary tightening as the currencies of these countries
have appreciated.
(4) Growth of all the monetary aggregates slowed further in
September, and preliminary data suggest that expansion of M1 and M2 has
remained quite weak in October, as higher interest rates and opportunity
costs continue to curb demands for monetary assets. M3, however, ap-
pears to have rebounded this month in association with a resumption of
growth in bank credit. For the two months combined, M2 has expanded at
about a 1-1/2 percent rate, below the 3 percent August-to-December rate
specified by the FOMC at its September meeting, and M3 has increased at
about a 3 percent rate, compared with its 5 percent path. Since the
fourth quarter of 1987, M2 has risen at a 5-1/4 pace, placing that ag-
gregate below the middle of its target range, while M3 has expanded at a
(5) Retail-type balances within M2 have grown at about a 3-1/2
percent rate over the last two months, about in line with expectations
at the last FOMC meeting. Issuance of consumer CDs has picked up sharp-
ly while liquid deposits have run off, consistent with the further
steepening of the deposit yield curve over the summer. The shortfall in
M2 has been concentrated in its volatile wholesale components--overnight
RPs and Eurodollars--and in demand deposits. With respect to demand
deposits, the decline in compensating balances may be a little stronger
than expected, while the weakness in the other components reflects re-
duced needs for funding owing to a sharp rise in Treasury balances and a
sluggish pace of bank credit growth on balance over the two months.
However, credit growth still has exceeded expansion of core deposits at
large banks; with Eurodollar rates tending to rise relative to domestic
rates as the dollar declined, commercial banks have been issuing large
time deposits in the United States at a rapid pace, helping to sustain
expansion of M3 above the pace of M2.
(6) The slowing in bank credit growth over September and
October combined does not seem to have shown through to overall domestic
nonfinancial debt, as part of the weakness in bank credit was accounted
for by loan sales and a drop in loans to financial borrowers. Debt
growth appears to have remained around its 8-1/2 percent average pace
for the year to date. Issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations
was again relatively light in September and October and sales by invest-
ment-grade industrial corporations have virtually ceased in the last few
days, following the large buyout announcements. Business borrowing from
shorter-term sources, while picking up this month, also has remained
sluggish. The slower pace of business borrowing in the third quarter
occurred despite an estimated widening in the financing gap, and is
mostly explained by a temporary drop-off in completed mergers and
buyouts. However, available data suggest borrowing by the household
sector has been well-maintained in recent months, partly in association
with fairly robust home sales. And, borrowing by both federal and state
and local governments picked up somewhat--the latter in anticipation of
possible expiration of the tax-exempt status of certain revenue bonds.
Policy Alternatives
(7) The standard three policy alternatives are presented
below. Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be built
with seasonal plus adjustment borrowing of $600 million, while under
alternatives A and C reserve paths would incorporate borrowing levels of
$400 million and $800 million, respectively.
(8) The table below presents monetary growth rates over the
September-to-December period associated with the policy alternatives.1
M2 growth, though picking up a bit, would remain sluggish under all of
the alternatives, with its M1 component continuing especially weak.
Further adjustment of portfolios to the previous rise in interest rates
and opportunity costs is expected to continue to restrain retail ac-
counts in M2 over the remainder of this year, while efforts by busi-
nesses to pare demand deposits in association with lowered compensating
balance requirements should depress M1 and to a lesser extent M2 in-
creasingly as year-end approaches. Despite the expected slight acceler-
ation in M2, its earlier weakness should keep growth of this aggregate
from its August base a bit below the 3 percent specification in the
directive issued at the September FOMC meeting. For the year, M2 growth
is expected to come in at around 5-1/4 percent under all the alterna-

(9) Projections of M2 and M3 incorporate some allowance for
the effects of a surge in merger and buyout activity that now seems
likely in the fourth quarter. Banks are expected to provide a substan-
tial portion of the initial financing, boosting their funding needs.
The overnight Eurodollar component of M2 may be lifted as banks become
more aggressive bidders in Eurodollar markets. In addition, M2 may be
affected temporarily if equity sellers hold liquid balances while decid-
ing on how to realign their portfolios. However, the greater effect is
likely to be on M3, given its broader range of managed liabilities.
This aggregate would have been expected to strengthen even in the ab-
sence of the new buyouts, as bank credit rebounded further and Treasury
deposit balances were drawn down, but the pickup is now seen as somewhat
greater. The effect is likely to be quite uneven, depending on the
timing of the transactions, but on balance M3 over November and December
now is projected to accelerate sufficiently under all three alternatives
to imply growth from August at nearly the 5 percent path specified at
the last FOMC meeting. This growth will keep M3 expansion for the year
at around 6-1/4 percent, a little above its midpoint.

(10) Maintenance of current reserve conditions under alterna-
tive B is in line with market expectations about the near-term course of
policy, and as a consequence any changes in interest rates and dollar
exchange rates are likely to be relatively small. The federal funds
rate under the borrowing specifications of this alternative would be
expected to remain mostly in an 8 to 8-1/4 percent range. While con-
tinuation of the recent firmness cannot be ruled out, the funds rate may
move a little lower in this range as the effects of the temporary fac-
tors that appear to have reduced demands for borrowed reserves wear off.
In this case, other short-term rates would edge down as well. However,
very short-term rates could firm a bit in December as banks and other
borrowers position themselves in anticipation of year-end pressures;
some year-end pressures have already began to show through in short-term
rates, though far less than last year. While rates already have ad-
justed to an extent to anticipated buyouts, further temporary effects
may accompany the financial flows associated with the actual transac-
tions. CD and commercial paper issuance should balloon, possibly
putting some upward pressure on private short-term rates, and substan-
tial new supplies of low-grade corporate bonds also may be forthcoming.
In the Treasury market, some increases in bond rates could occur if the
Treasury were to announce a larger-than-usual offering on the mid-
quarter refunding to take advantage of the shortage of bonds created by
the absence of a long bond at the previous refunding as well as by
skimpy offerings of investment-grade corporate bonds.
(11) Under alternative B, M2 growth would strengthen modest-
ly--to a 3 percent rate--from the 1-1/4 percent pace of September and
October, largely reflecting some turnaround in overnight RPs and
Eurodollars. In addition, growth in retail accounts in M2 would firm a
little; the damping influence of earlier increases in market interest
rates should diminish, in part as opportunity costs edge down with
rising deposit offering rates. M1 would be expected to be about un-
changed over November and December as demand deposits and OCDs continue
to run off through year-end. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would be
about flat in the fourth quarter and growth in its velocity would
strengthen to a 6-1/2 percent rate given the staff GNP forecast. M2
would grow at only a 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter on this basis,
implying a 4-1/2 percent rate of increase in its velocity. Such an
increase in velocity is a little larger than implied by the staff models
of M2 demand, which show the rise in interest rates from earlier this
year damping M2 growth in the fourth quarter by about 3-1/2 percent, but
within their usual margin of error. Under this alternative, M2 would
enter the year at around the lower end of its provisional range for
strengthen only gradually next year, remaining well down in its range
for some time.
(12) M3 growth is expected to pick up to a 6-1/2 percent rate
over November and December under alternative B, implying quarterly
average growth of 4-1/2 percent in the current quarter and a further
rise in its velocity--at a 2 percent rate. Under this alternative, M3
would begin the year in the upper half of its tentative range. However,
M3 growth might weaken a bit in the early part of 1989 as bank loans to
finance buyouts were repaid or sold to other investors. And, in
general, trend growth in bank and thrift credit should remain damped in
response to capital requirements and regulatory pressures.
(13) Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to
strengthen to a 9 percent pace over November and December, leaving
growth for 1988 at 8-3/4 percent and placing the debt aggregate on a
path around year-end near the middle of its tentative monitoring range
for next year. In addition to the financing of equity retirements,
business demands for funds will be augmented by a larger shortfall of
internal funds in relation to investment spending. Household borrowing
is expected to be well maintained through year-end, with mortgage de-
mands tilting more in the direction of fixed-rate contracts in response
to their narrower spread over ARM borrowing costs. Borrowing by the
federal government should drop substantially on a seasonally adjusted
basis, but this would not represent any abatement of underlying pres-
sures by this sector on financial markets as a somewhat larger deficit
is financed by a drawdown of cash balances. Issuance of tax-exempt debt
is expected to moderate somewhat, especially now that authority to issue
tax-exempt revenue bonds has been extended another year.
(14) Under alternative A, money market interest rates would
decline about 1/2 percentage point, with the 3-month Treasury bill drop-
ping to a little below 7 percent. The dollar would come under sharp
downward pressure, especially in view of the remote prospects for a com-
parable easing of policy abroad. Long-term interest rates would decline
further but the extent of the drop might be limited by the weaker tone
of the dollar and would depend in any event on market interpretations as
to whether incoming data suggested a sustained easing of pressures on
domestic resources and prices. In the absence of particularly weak
economic data, the yield curve could steepen a bit.
(15) The decline in money market rates and opportunity costs
would strengthen M2 growth over November and December to a 4-1/4 percent
average rate. Its M1 component also would pick up over the final two
months of the year, though demand deposits would still run off as com-
pensating balances were adjusted to previous increases in rates. Early
next year, M2 would be close to the midpoint of its provisional range
and on a trajectory that would lift it into the upper half of that
range. M3 growth would pick up to a 7 percent rate over November and
December, placing this aggregate on a path above the midpoint of its
provisional range early next year.
(16) With little anticipation of a near-term tightening of
policy remaining in the market, short-term interest rates would climb
about 1/2 percentage point under alternative C. The dollar probably
would reverse some of its recent decline, and long-term interest rates
also would rise. The extent of this rise could be relatively small if
the tightening of policy were interpreted as damping activity and reduc-
ing inflationary risks in an economy that was already seen to be
experiencing more moderate growth.
(17) Under alternative C, M2 would expand at only a 2 percent
rate over the remainder of the year. This aggregate would be well below
the lower end of its provisional range at the beginning of 1989 and
given the lagged effect of the change in interest rates, growth would
remain quite damped for a while. Wider opportunity costs would reduce
inflows to retail accounts, and M1 balances would contract. M3 still
would continue to strengthen under this alternative--the pickup, though,
being limited by rate-induced outflows from money funds--and enter 1989
well within its tentative range.
Directive Language
(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the
usual options, is shown below. Note that, consistent with the specifica-
tions presented above and past practice for meetings at this time of the
year, the suggested base for the monetary aggregates has been moved from
August to September.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,
the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain
(Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of
pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications
of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expan-
sion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and develop-
ments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets,
somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT),
or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might,
be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated
reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth
of M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: August] SEPTEMBER through
December at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 3-and-5] percent,
respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consul-
tation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations
that reserve conditions during the period before the next
meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate
persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6-to-10] percent.
