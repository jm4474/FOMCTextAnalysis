MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent developments
(1) Since the August FOMC meeting, reserve paths have continued
to specify adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $600 million. After the
preceding the meeting, this level of borrowing was expected to be associ-
ated with federal funds trading in a range of 8 to 8-1/4 percent. Over the
two complete maintenance periods since the discount rate hike, adjustment
plus seasonal borrowing averaged $592 million and the federal funds rate
averaged 8.13 percent. Thus far in the current period, borrowing is run-
ning at close to $590 million and the federal funds rate is averaging 8-1/8
percent. Reflecting declines in both required and excess reserves, total
reserves fell in August. However, because currency continued to grow--
albeit at a reduced pace--the monetary base increased at a 2-1/2 percent
(2) While federal funds have continued to trade near their level
at the time of the last FOMC meeting, most other market rates have declined
since then. Data suggesting a more moderate pace of economic expansion and
weaker oil prices apparently were interpreted as pointing to some reduction
in potential inflation pressures and to a lesser likelihood of a near-term

tightening of monetary policy. Bond yields have dropped as much as 3/8 of
a percentage point; rates on fixed-rate mortgages in the primary market,
though falling most recently, have lagged other rates and are down only
about half that amount on balance over the intermeeting period. The de-
cline in bond rates contributed to higher stock prices, which are up an
average of about 3 percent over the period. Most short-term rates are down
roughly 1/4 to 3/8 of a percentage point since the August meeting, with the
exception of the 3-month Treasury bill rate which has moved up slightly,
buoyed in part by an enlarged supply.
(3) The upward pressure on the dollar that had prevailed before
the August FOMC meeting continued until late in the month, when hikes in
European official lending rates arrested the dollar's climb. The dollar
moved lower along with U.S. interest rates following the employment report
for August. As the mark recovered against the dollar, it also moved to the
top of the EMS parity grid, and with tensions emerging in the EMS, German
short-term market interest rates eased back somewhat. Even so, the spread
of short-term U.S. rates over the average of foreign rates is now narrower
than it was prior to the U.S. discount rate increase. More recently, the
dollar has firmed in response to publication of favorable trade data for
July, leaving the exchange rate little changed on balance for the entire
intermeeting period.
(4) The monetary aggregates slowed further in August, and early
data suggest that this trend has continued into September. M2 was re-
strained to a 2-1/2 percent annual rate last month mainly by the earlier
rise in market interest rates, which substantially increased the oppor-
tunity costs of most monetary assets. In addition, M3 growth slowed in
August to a 4 percent pace. For July and August combined, growth of M2 and
M3 averaged just below the 3-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent rates specified by the
Committee for the June-to-September period. Since the fourth quarter of
(5) The deceleration in M2 last month was concentrated in its
liquid deposit components: demand deposits, OCDs, and MMDAs all ran off,
and savings deposits slowed. (Indeed, M1 was flat in August, after expand-
ing at more than a 9 percent rate in the previous two months.) By con-
trast, small time deposits picked up, buoyed by a deposit yield curve that
has steepened since the spring. Overnight RPs rebounded from their July
decline, along with a turnaround in bank holdings of government securities.
As a result of that turnaround, bank credit growth strengthened somewhat
last month despite a sharp slowdown in business lending. Managed liabili-
ties in the non-M2 portion of M3 continued to expand rapidly in August, but
on balance instruments outside M3--such as borrowings from banks' own
foreign offices--funded the pickup in bank credit growth and also offset
some of the weakness in core deposits. Growth of both M2 and M3 may have
been damped a bit by regulators' efforts to moderate thrift deposit pricing
behavior and to restrain asset growth; both retail time deposits and large
CDs at thrift institutions have been relatively weak in recent months.
(6) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have
grown at a slightly faster pace in August. The pickup was most evident in
its federal component, especially in an increase of bill issuance in
advance of seasonally larger deficits and in light of uncertainty about
authority to issue long-term bonds. Business borrowing apparently remained
subdued as a rebound in commercial paper issuance and an increase in bond
offerings about offset the marked slowdown in bank loans. To a degree, the
reduced pace of business borrowing thus far in the third quarter may
reflect some slowing of equity retirements. Bank data suggest that con-
sumer borrowing may have increased in August from a relatively sluggish
pace in July. In response to the high level of rates, residential mortgage
lending seems to have moderated in July. Since the fourth quarter of 1987,
overall domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at an 8-1/2 percent rate, a
little below the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range.
Policy alternatives
(7) Three policy alternatives are presented below. Under alter-
native B, reserve paths would continue to be drawn with adjustment plus
seasonal borrowing of $600 million, while under alternatives A and C
reserve paths would embody borrowing levels of $400 million and $800 mil-
lion, respectively. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be
expected to continue to trade generally in the 8 to 8-1/4 percent area. In
the next few days, however, a tax-related surge in the Treasury balance
could push the funds rate briefly to or even above 8-1/4 percent, and
temporary pressures could resurface around quarter end. The funds rate
would fall to the 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent area under alternative A and rise
to the 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent area under alternative C.
(8) The table below presents growth rates of the monetary aggre-
gates for the August-to-December period expected under the three alterna-
tives. Under all the alternatives, money growth is expected to remain
relatively slow over coming months. This reflects, in part, continued
adjustment by money holders to previous increases in interest rates and
opportunity costs. In addition, regulators are assumed to maintain
pressures on thrifts to hold down costs and asset growth, continuing to
damp expansion of retail time deposits and large CDs. Finally, the climb
in market interest rates over the spring and summer may have an especially
pronounced effect on demand deposits as year-end approaches. If, given the
rise in rates, business demand deposits exceed the lower levels needed to
meet compensating balance requirements, businesses would reduce these
deposits late this year, as they did in late 1987, with effects on M2 as
well as M1. All the alternatives would leave M2 in the fourth quarter
somewhat below and M3 somewhat above the midpoints of their annual ranges
for 1988, and M1 around 4 percent above its level in the fourth quarter of
imply divergent trajectories in the aggregates by the turn of the year.

(9) With markets now expecting no change in policy over the near
term, short-term rates likely would remain near current levels under alter-
native B; the 3-month Treasury bill rate should stay around 7-1/4 percent.
The dollar will probably trade around recent levels for a while under this
alternative especially if, as seems likely, foreign monetary policies are
also unchanged over coming weeks. In this environment, the behavior of
bond yields will depend importantly on the strength of incoming data on the

economy and prices. If such data confirm market perceptions of moderate
growth and little additional pressure on prices, these yields probably
would hold at recent lower levels. But bond yields would retrace some of
their recent declines if incoming information shows less moderation in
demands and more strength in oil prices than now seems built into market
expectations. In addition, bond yields may have been held down by a
paucity of supply, which could be reversed by congressional passage of
long-bond authorization for the Treasury or by decisions by corporations or
state and local governments to take advantage of recently reduced long-term
(10) M2 is expected to continue to grow at a 3 percent annual rate
from August to December under alternative B, with particular weakness in
liquid deposits; M1 is projected to increase at only a 1/2 percent annual
rate over this period. Although offering rates should move closer to cur-
rent levels of market interest rates, growth of M1 and M2 relative to
income will be restrained by the earlier widening of opportunity costs and
the other factors discussed above. M2 velocity would rise at a 3 percent
rate in the fourth quarter, somewhat faster than in the current quarter,
and M1 velocity at a 5-1/2 percent rate.
(11) M3 likely would continue to grow at a 5 percent rate under
alternative B, and its velocity would edge up again in the fourth quarter.
A further moderation in credit growth at thrifts, and associated funding
needs, is likely to be offset by some pickup in bank credit, as lending to
businesses and securities acquisitions rebound following weakness over July
and August. Total borrowing by businesses is expected to strengthen some-
what over the balance of the year, reflecting larger external financing
needs and substantial further share retirements, with credit demands still
focused to a large extent on the short- and intermediate-term markets.
Domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to rise at a 8-1/2 percent rate over
the last four months of the year and for the year as a whole, leaving it
somewhat below the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range.
(12) With markets not now expecting a near-term tightening of
policy, the rise in the federal funds rate under the firmer reserve condi-
tions of alternative C would be about matched by increases in other short-
term rates--perhaps including the prime rate. Bond yields and the dollar
also would back up; the amounts would depend on surrounding circumstances,
but could be considerable if market participants extrapolated a renewed
tightening trend for policy in the context of incoming data suggesting
continued momentum in the economy. Foreign monetary authorities might
follow suit to temper the rise in the dollar. The further rise in oppor-
tunity costs under alternative C would likely damp M2 growth to only a 2
percent rate over the August-to-December period, and its M1 component would
be expected to decline a little. By the end of the year, M2 would be
growing at only a 1 percent rate. M3 growth also would slow from its pace
of recent months, mainly reflecting further weakness in institution-only
money market mutual funds.
(13) Under alternative A, M2 and M3 would strengthen over the
August-to-December period. Partly owing to some narrowing of opportunity
costs, M2 by December would likely be growing at a rate around the 5 per-
cent midpoint of its provisional range for next year, and M3 at 7 percent.
An immediate easing would come as a surprise to market participants, given
the recent policies and statements of the Federal Reserve and current per-
ceptions that inflationary pressures, though perhaps less certain to mount,
are not likely to moderate substantially. Short-term market rates would
drop immediately by about the full extent of the easing in the funds rate,
and bond yields would also decline. The initial bond market response could
be substantial, but if data failed to confirm some further moderation in
the economy and price pressures, bond yields could retrace much of these
declines, especially if downward pressure on the dollar persisted.
Directive language
(14) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual
alternatives for varying degrees of reserve pressure, is presented below.
The draft language on possible intermeeting adjustments also has the usual
options for symmetry and asymmetry and retains the ordering of the factors
to be considered in making such adjustments that was adopted at the August
