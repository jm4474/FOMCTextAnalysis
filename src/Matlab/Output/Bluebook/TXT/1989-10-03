MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The Federal Reserve has maintained an unchanged stance in
the reserves market since the August FOMC meeting. The borrowing objec-
tive has been kept at $550 million, and borrowing averaged $554 million in
the two complete maintenance periods since that meeting. Through the
first eight days of the current maintenance period, borrowing has
increased to $758 million, but $166 million of this appears to be attrib-
utable to problems associated with Hurricane Hugo. Seasonal credit has
dropped only a little since the past meeting, and adjustment borrowing
(abstracting from the hurricane's effect) remains unusually low. Federal
funds have traded mostly in a narrow range around 9 percent, as they have
since late July.
(2) With federal funds steady and economic data released over the
intermeeting period generally according with market expectations, most
interest rates are little changed on balance. Rates did soften some
through mid-September, at least partly on a sense that the strengthening
dollar could improve the odds of an easing in monetary policy. In the
case of Treasury securities, this movement was accentuated by the well-
publicized difficulties of a few prominent issuers of junk bonds that
touched off a mild flight to quality. At their intermeeting lows, Trea-
sury bill rates were down about 1/2 percentage point, and Treasury bond
yields had fallen 1/4 point. These gains began to erode when tensions in
the junk bond market eased and interest rates generally edged higher as
the dollar declined against other G-10 currencies. The stock market
reached record highs in early September but began to retreat as problems
emerged in junk bonds; on balance most indexes still are up 2 to 3 percent
over the intermeeting period.
(3) Interest rates on mortgages and mortgage-related securities
generally have fallen relative to yields on benchmark Treasury issues.
Narrower spreads in the mortgage market likely owe to improved investor
confidence in the ability of the market to absorb assets from thrifts.
Commercial banks, the federal mortgage agencies, and insurance companies
among others, have proven willing to step up acquisitions of mortgage
assets. Given this apparent willingness, along with evidence of some
rebound in housing sales, it is believed that mortgage credit has been
well maintained in recent months.
(4) The dollar strengthened through mid-September, despite the
edging down of interest rates in the United States and some increase in
rates abroad. Subsequently the dollar eased, and then dropped sharply
immediately after the release of the G-7 statement on September 23 and the
associated visible coordinated intervention
In addition, growing market expectations that monetary policy abroad might
be tightened have contributed to the slippage of the dollar in recent
days. On balance over the intermeeting period, the dollar is 2-1/2 per-
cent lower against the trade-weighted average of other G-10 currencies.
. The Desk sold about $3.4 billion against yen and marks,
nearly $1 billion of this total following the G-7 meeting.
(5) Growth in the monetary aggregates slowed in August and Sep-
tember from their advanced July pace, which likely had been boosted by the
replenishment of balances used to pay taxes last spring. M1 rose at a
rate of only 3/4 percent in August, and is expected to increase at around
a 5 percent clip in September. While M2 also decelerated, its growth
remained at a brisk 7-1/4 percent pace over August and September. At an
Committee's specification at the August FOMC meeting of 9 percent, and has
lifted M2 to about 4 percent, at an annual rate, above its 1988-Q4 base.
Weakness in demand deposits and overnight RPs and Eurodollars restrained
M2 in August and September; the retail components of M2 expanded at close
to a 10 percent pace in all three months of the quarter. Growth in these
components has been supported by the lagged effects of earlier declines in
market interest rates. Inflows to money funds were particularly strong,
buoyed by the drop in small time deposit rates, shifts from junk bond
funds, and special promotional activities by certain fund sponsors.
Deposit expansion was concentrated at commercial banks as the yield
advantage on thrift deposits shrank. On balance, the thrift bailout so
far seems primarily to have affected the composition of M2, rather than
its growth rate.
(6) In contrast to its minimal net effect on the growth of M2,
the restructuring of the thrift industry has stunted growth of M3. Expan-
sion of this aggregate slipped to less than a 2 percent rate over August
and September, lower even than the 5-3/4 percent pace projected at the
August FOMC meeting. This brought June-to-September growth to 4 percent,
compared with the 7 percent specification of the Committee, moving it to
around the lower bound of its 1989 target cone. Before today, the RTC
had disbursed a little over half of the $20 billion authorized for spend-
ing in fiscal year 1989. However, only a portion of these funds, per-
haps $4 to $5 billion by month-end, had been used to directly replace
liabilities in M3, including deposit payoffs at liquidated institutions.3
More important for M3 have been the efforts of a much broader group of
inadequately capitalized thrift institutions to shrink their balance
sheets. These undercapitalized thrifts account for the bulk of the over
$17 billion decline (40 percent at an annual rate) in the sum of large
time deposits and term RPs at thrift institutions from July to September.
As a group, thrifts account for slightly more than half of the shortfall
of M3 in September relative to the Committee's August path, with most of
the remainder attributable to a significantly higher Treasury balance at
commercial banks--itself partly a product of funding the thrift bailout--
and some shortfall in bank credit.
advances from Federal Home Loan Banks and other non-M3 borrowings.

(7) The trend of debt growth appears to have been well maintained
in recent months. Debt of the nonfinancial sectors appears to have
accelerated to about a 9-1/2 percent rate of growth in August, but much of
this pickup can be traced to a burst of short-term borrowing by the Trea-
sury to cover the RTC's initial outlays; private debt growth appears to
have quickened slightly. Consumer credit likely grew faster in August, at
least in part because of incentive-driven increases in auto sales. The
pace of borrowing in the business sector ebbed in August, however, and
appears to be fairly subdued in September as well.
Policy Alternatives
(8) Three alternatives are presented below. Under alternative B,
a federal funds rate of around 9 percent would be expected to be asso-
ciated, at least initially, with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
$500 million. This level of borrowing is $50 million less than the cur-
rent assumption, in order to take into account the decline in seasonal
borrowing that is likely to occur early in the intermeeting period. Based
on the experience of last year, seasonal borrowing should not only drop
significantly in the next maintenance period but also fall substantially
further over the balance of the intermeeting period, suggesting that
another downward technical adjustment might be called for before the next
meeting. Such adjustments are needed this year because seasonal borrowing
has reached record levels and its seasonal decline will be exceptionally
large. Moreover, with adjustment borrowing close to frictional levels, it
probably is relatively insensitive to movements in the spread between the
federal funds and discount rates. Thus, in current circumstances the
funds rate would tend to rise appreciably in the absence of technical
adjustments to the borrowing assumption because the interest sensitivity
of seasonal and adjustment borrowing combined is quite low. This also
implies that, under alternative A, a decline of only $100 million in the
borrowing objective--to $400 million--is likely to be associated with a
decrease in the federal funds rate to around 8-1/2 percent; similarly, a
rise of only $100 million in borrowing--to $600 million--would be asso-
ciated with an increase in the federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent
under alternative C. In any event, owing to the continued uncertainty
about the borrowing relationship, some flexibility in pursuit of the bor-
rowing objective would again seem to be warranted.
(9) Under all of the alternatives, M2 is expected to stay comfor-
tably within its annual range this year. Indeed, supported by previous
declines in market interest rates, this aggregate would continue to rise
within the lower half of its range over the remainder of this year. M3 is
likely to grow sluggishly under all three alternatives, remaining a little
above the lower end of its annual range. Growth of this aggregate will be
damped by ongoing reductions in assets and M3 liabilities at undercapi-
talized thrifts and by RTC outlays that substitute in part for M3 managed
liabilities. However, the staff has assumed both of these activities will
slow somewhat on average in the fourth quarter from the pace of recent
months, contributing to some acceleration in M3. M1 would expand under
all three alternatives, returning it by year-end to about its level at the
end of 1988.

(10) Interest rates would be expected to remain near current
levels under alternative B. Markets do not now appear to be anticipating
any near-term change in policy, and incoming economic data consistent
with the staff greenbook forecast are not likely to provoke significant
change in market sentiment. In the weeks ahead, Treasury markets may be
buffeted by the possible sale of sizable volumes of REFCORP bonds and by
shifting odds on triggering a debt ceiling decline on November 1, which
could affect the mid-quarter refunding. The dollar would be expected to
fluctuate around current lower levels, or weaken a little further should
some key foreign central banks tighten policy--as to a degree now seems to
be expected by markets. Should the dollar rebound strongly, however,
domestic interest rates might edge off if market participants saw this as
implying reduced inflation pressures and greater prospects for policy
easing in the United States.
(11) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to grow at a 6-1/2 per-
cent annual rate over the September-to-December period, a little below the
recent pace. This implies quarterly average growth at a 6-3/4 percent
rate and a further decline in velocity at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, re-
flecting the lagged effects of earlier interest rate declines. Monthly
inflows to retail M2 would be expected to moderate as the effects of pre-
vious declines in opportunity costs abate, and as money funds no longer
are boosted by shifts from junk bond funds and by special promotional
efforts. Retail deposit growth at thrift institutions is likely to remain
sluggish owing to the less aggressive bidding posture of these institu-
tions recently. On the other hand, overnight RPs are not expected to run
off further and demand deposits might strengthen if compensating balances
need to be boosted by year-end to take account of the lower level of mar-
ket interest rates. Overall, Ml should grow at around a 4-1/2 percent
rate over this period, near its September pace.
(12) Under alternative B, M3 growth would pick up a bit from its
August and September pace to a 4-1/2 percent rate. In addition to the
slowing of reductions in assets and M3 liabilities at thrifts, bank credit
may strengthen. While banks continue to enjoy relatively favorable core
deposit inflows, banks will need to tap additional managed liabilities to
fund the faster credit growth and replace balances withdrawn by the
Treasury. Banks should continue to make further large acquisitions of
mortgage assets, whose returns are still relatively attractive. More
generally, enlarged issuance of mortgage-backed securities and heightened
activity by sponsored agencies will facilitate the redistribution of
mortgage lending without further significant effects on its cost and
availability. In the business sector, borrowing is expected to remain
around the reduced pace of recent months, despite some dropoff in cor-
porate share retirements owing in part to the higher cost of leveraging.
Although Treasury borrowing also will slacken, this deceleration merely
represents-the movement of RTC financing off budget in the new fiscal
year, rather than a decline in underlying credit demands. In total,
domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to grow at around an 8 percent
annual rate over the fourth quarter, implying similar growth for the year,
a little below the midpoint of its annual monitoring range.
(13) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates are likely
to fall in tandem with the 50 basis point drop in the funds rate. The
dollar would decline, and the decline might be substantial if the Federal
Reserve's action were interpreted as a willingness to use monetary policy
to bring about a depreciation of the dollar. Bond rates probably would
move lower, though by less than short-term rates. Limiting the response
of bonds might be a sense that following the unanticipated easing of
policy, the economy could be a little stronger than previously expected in
dollar were particularly sharp. The decline in rates would tend to boost
M2 growth to a somewhat faster pace than in August and September. Early
next year, the continuing effects of the further decline in opportunity
costs, along with a tendency for income growth to begin to strengthen,
likely would result in growth of M2 at a rate above the Committee's tenta-
tive range for 1990. M3 growth would strengthen to a 5 percent rate over
the September-to-December period under alternative A.
(14) The tightening of policy under alternative C would come as a
surprise to the markets, especially in the present international environ-
ment. Money market interest rates would rise by around the 50 basis point
hike in the federal funds rate, and the dollar would strengthen. With
such a tightening not built into yield curves, bond rates would be
expected to firm somewhat in the near term as the market reassessed the
degree of aggressiveness by the System in pursuing its price stability
objective. M2 growth over the September-to-December period would slow to
a 5 percent rate. The composition of inflows would move toward small time
deposits, whose rates adjust more promptly, and away from liquid accounts;
its M1 component would slow to a 2-1/2 percent rate. The restraining
effects of higher interest rates and opportunity costs under this alterna-
tive should be sufficient to hold M2 to around the middle of its tentative
percent annual rate, ending the year very close to the lower end of its
Directive language
(15) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the
usual options and updating, is shown below.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/
INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve
positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability,
the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the
monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and
domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve
restraint might (WOULD) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve
restraint (MIGHT) would be acceptable in the intermeeting
period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be
consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June
through September THROUGH DECEMBER at annual rates of about
____ AND ____ [DEL: 9 and 7] percent, respectively. The Chairman may call
for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for
Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period
before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a
federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7
to 11] percent.
