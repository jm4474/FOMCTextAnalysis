1971-07-27,1,"(1) Growth of the narrowly-defined money supply in July appears
to be somewhat faster than projected in the last blue book, as best can be
judged by information available through the week of the 21st, with data for
the latter week partly estimated. The broader money supply (M2) appears to
be increasing less rapidly than projected, however, as a substantial short-
fall below path in time deposits other than CD's more than offset the over-
shoot in private demand deposits. And with U.S. Government deposits much
weaker than expected and nondeposit sources of funds continuing to decline
on balance, the bank credit proxy appears to be falling very considerably
short of expectations in July.

1973-09-18,1,"(1) RPD's now appear to be growing around the mid-point of the
Committee's August-September range of tolerance, but M1 appears to be well
below and M2 is near the bottom of their respective ranges, as the table
shows. In August the narrowly defined money supply experienced a small
contraction instead of expanding slightly as projected, and growth of M2
at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate was also substantially short of expecta-
tions. The smaller shortfall from target for M2 as compared with M1
reflects the continuing expansion in consumer-type time deposits, particu-

larly the 4-year wild card accounts. The fact that RPD's are growing around
the mid-point of their range of tolerance, even though the money supply
aggregates are low, stems from the Committee's decision to reduce (by two
per centage points) the whole range of tolerance for RPD's relative to
that shown in the Bluebook for alternative B, while dropping (by just one
per centage point) only the low ends of the ranges for M1 and M2 .

1970-09-15,2,"(2) The rapid August growth rate for the published money stock
also reflected a marked reduction in the importance of several types of
international transfers at major banks; these transfers had the effect on
the published figures of understating the growth rate of the money supply
earlier in 1970. Because the sources of bias became less important in
August than in earlier months, once the published data are roughly ad-
Justed to eliminate the effect of these biases (as explained in the
appendix), the August change in the money stock adjusts downward to an
annual rate of around 9 per cent. Since only one of the sources of bias
in the money supply data affects the bank credit proxy, adjustments to
eliminate bias produce only very minor changes in the proxy series.

1972-07-18,2,"(2) With private demand deposits coming in below expectations
in the latter part of June, M 1 expanded at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate
for the month, about one and a half percentage points below the rate built
into the alternative B path of the last Committee meeting. In the first
two statement weeks of July, however, there has apparently been a sharp
pick-up in the rate of expansion, and the level of M1 moved substantially
above the path levels specified earlier. It seems possible that the late
June weakness in narrowly defined money supply temporarily reflected in
some part either direct or indirect effects of large outflows of dollars
from the U. S.
","alternative B"
1970-03-10,3,"(3) While the staff had expected some gradual improvement
in time deposit performance under the less restrictive alternative a opted
by the Committee, the improvement developed more rapidly than projected
partly because of an earlier and larger decline in bill rates than
anticipated. Much of the improved performance of time deposits was
attributable to consumer-type deposits at banks outside major money
centers. In addition, the attrition of domestic large negotiable CD's
came to a halt in early February, and inflows of foreign official funds
into time deposits were larger than expected.
","alternative a"
1972-08-15,3,"(3) The early July bulge in private demand deposits evident at
the time of the last Committee meeting receded somewhat over the latter part
of the month, but this drop-off was significantly smaller than expected.
As a result, M1 rose at a 15 per cent annual rate during the month, even
faster than the 10.4 per cent rate estimated for the policy alternative
approved at the last meeting. 1/ Data for the first two weeks of August
indicated that M1 is continuing to exceed levels thought likely a month ago,
although the differences are not so sharp as in July. During the second
quarter, the demand for cash balances had seemed on the low side, given the
rapid expansion of nominal GNP and the marked earlier decline of interest
rates extending into early 1972. Thus, the stronger July and August perform-
ance may be signaling a catch-up to more normal relationships between changes
in M1, interest rates, and GNP.

1971-07-27,4,"(4) During the first three statement weeks of July member bank
borrowings averaged about $930 million, about $415 million above the June
average. Apparently in recent weeks many banks that had borrowed relatively
little at the discount window have become more willing borrowers, given the
spread of the Federal funds rate above the discount rate. Excess reserves
have been volatile over the past three weeks, and net borrowed reserves of
member banks have ranged from $350 to $950 million, with the average level
considerably deeper than in June.

1971-07-27,5,"(5) Although M1 in July has turned out to be somewhat
stronger than previously projected, the need for reserves in the first three
weeks of the month was considerably less than expected (as shown by the
difference between ""path"" and ""actual"" required reserves in the table above).
The lower level of required reserves relative to path was mainly the result
of large downward adjustments in preliminary estimates of private demand
deposits during the last two weeks of June, and much lower than expected U.S.
Government deposits in early July. Thus, with the need for reserves reduced,
growth of member bank total reserves in July is falling substantially short
of what was implied by the alternative B path at the time of the last
Committee meeting, as shown in the table above, despite the sharp rise
in member bank borrowings. Nonborrowed reserves were even further below
path than total reserves--and showed an actual decline from June to July
--as the Desk provided fewer reserves given the increased demand for
borrowings by banks.

In the case of M 1 the annual growth rate for August was 6 per cent, as shown
in attached Table 2. However, data for early September suggest that growth of
M1 will be rapid from August to September, and is thus likely to be stronger
in the third quarter than thought at the last FOMC meeting.
","alternative B"
1973-12-17,5,"(6) Of the three alternatives summarized below for Committee
consideration, alternative B includes a growth rate for M1 over the
first half of 1974 that is consistent with the extension to mid-year of
the 5 per cent growth path adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting.
This growth path starts from the revised September 1973 base (which is about
$2-1/2 billion above the old series, as was indicated in the previous bluebook).
In alternative B, M1 is targeted to increase at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate
from December '73-to June '74. This growth rate is lower than 5 per cent to
compensate for the overshoot in M1 growth in the fourth quarter. As shown in
the chart on the next page, the estimated level of the money stock in December
is about $1 billion above the path level for that month. Alternatives A and C
involve more and less rapid growth in the aggregates, respectively. (Detailed

1969-11-25,6,"(6) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy
directive, the Committee might wish to continue the language currently
in force which reads as follows (alternative A):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-
taining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.""
","alternative A"
1971-01-12,6,"(6) Taking the December figures as a starting point, the
table on the next page shows three patterns of growth for the monetary
aggregates over the first quarter which the Committee may wish to
consider. The three growth paths shown for the narrowly-defined money
supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the
recent shortfalls relative to expectations, as follows:
(A) Alternative A shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per
cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the first quarter of 1971. This
would be equal to the rate of growth for the quarter that the Committee
indicated as the minimum acceptable at its last meeting, at a time when
it was expected that fourth quarter growth would be 5 per cent. Thus
alternative A does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall. The
growth rate for the fourth and first quarters taken together would be
only about 4-3/4 per cent, as compared with the 5-1/2 per cent previously
desired. As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money
supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations.
(B) Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter
which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter.
The first quarter growth rate in this alternative is 7-1/2 per cent,
which would lead to a March level for the money stock equal to that
resulting from the earlier 5-1/2 per cent path for the fourth and first
quarters taken together.
(C) Alternative C, which has an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate of
growth in the first quarter for M1, makes up for the shortfall and raises
the growth rate in money supply for the September-to-March period back up
to the 6 per cent rate of expansion experienced over the first three
quarters of 1970.

from a range around those recently prevailing (Alt. A) to considerably
easier specifications. Overall credit conditions--as typified by behavior
of short- and long-term interest rates--might well ease somewhat between
now and the next Committee meeting even under Alternative A. Credit demands
from businesses and State and local governments in long-term markets appear
to be tapering off, and investors have shown a greater willingness to purchase
longer-term securities. Investors' demands will be influenced, however, by
their evaluation, as the details of Phase II become known, of the extent
to which it seems to promise significant restraint on wage and price pressures.

1972-01-11,6,"(6) Presented below for Committee consideration are two alterna-
tives for the second paragraph of the directive which differ with respect
to the kinds of operating procedures they imply but not necessarily with
respect to the monetary aggregate targets (whether I or II) the Committee
may wish to adopt. As noted below, the language of alternative A is quite
similar to that adopted by the Committee on December 14. Alternative B, on
the other hand, places primary stress on bank reserves as the operating
target variable, with a money market conditions constraint in a proviso
clause. The choice of operating procedure depends in part on the Committee's
relative confidence in reserves or money market conditions as bearing a more
dependable relationship to bank deposit behavior.
","alternative A, Alternative B"
1973-12-17,6,"(7) With regard to money market conditions, the staff would
expect some decline in the Federal funds rate between now and mid-January
if the Committee chooses to provide the reserves consistent with alternative B.
A funds rate range of 9--10-1/4 per cent is shown for that alternative. If
the rate were to drop toward the lower end of the range over the next few
weeks, the staff would not anticipate that any significant further reductions
would be needed in the first few months of 1974 to be consistent with the
targeted growth rates for money.

1974-01-21,6,"(8) Alternative C encompasses the 5-1/4 per cent growth rate
for M1 between December and June adopted by the Committee at its last
meeting. (This and other alternative growth rates are shown in the chart
on the following page in relation to the rate of increase for M1 over the
past year). The money market specifications for alternative C indicate
that continuation of the path for the aggregates adopted at the last
meeting would likely be associated with some upward movement in the
Federal funds rate from the prevailing level of around 9-3/4 per cent.
This now seems probable because we expect somewhat greater demand for
money in the first half of 1974 than we did at the time of the last

1976-04-20,6,"(6) In considering these alternative longer-run targets, the
Committee may be interested in their relationship to the QIV '76 levels for
the monetary aggregates that were implied by the mid-points of the ranges
adopted in January. From the fourth quarter of '75 to first quarter of '76,
M2 and M3 expanded at annual rates very near the mid-points of the ranges
adopted previously (and shown above under alternative B); thus, continuation
of growth near these rates would be associated with QIV '76 levels close to
those implied by the earlier targets. However, M1 growth from the fourth
to first quarter--at a 2.9 per cent annual rate--was well below both the
lower limit of the longer-run range and the 6 per cent mid-point of
that range. To achieve the level in QIV '76 implied by the mid-point of the
earlier range, M1 would have to grow at almost a 7 per cent annual rate over
the last three quarters of this year. Assuming M1 growth returns to a 6 per
cent annual rate in the first quarter of 1977, this would imply a growth rate

are lower than those currently in place. The staff has assumed that
a higher average level of market interest rates would be required in
the QIII '77-QIII '78 period than had been earlier contemplated to keep
M-1 growth at the mid-point of a 4-6½ per cent range in the face of an
apparently strengthened demand for cash balances. Higher interest rates
would work to constrain growth in the time and savings deposit component
of M-2 and M-3 by more than would be implied by the mid-points of the
current ranges for those aggregates. Alternatives A and C encompass,
respectively, slightly higher and slightly lower longer-run growth ranges
for the aggregates. Alternative D reflects a larger downward adjustment
in growth ranges, including a reduction in the M-1 range sufficient to
compensate for the third-quarter overshoot in M-1 growth.

associated federal funds rates--are presented below for consideration by
the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would be expected to
continue to trade around 8-1/4 percent, with an initial level of adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing of $350 million. The specifications of
alternative A call for federal funds trading around 7-3/4 percent and a
borrowing level of $300 million, while those of alternative C call for
federal funds in the 8-3/4 percent area, which is likely to involve $400
million of borrowing. Judging from the experience of recent years, it is
anticipated that seasonal borrowing will rise about $100 million over the
intermeeting period; the borrowing levels suggested above incorporate a
$50 million technical increase to take account of the expected rise in the
next few weeks, but an additional increase in the borrowing path may be
necessary under all three alternatives.

1991-11-05,6,"(7) Two alternatives are presented below for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue
to trade around 5 percent in combination with adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $175 million.3  Under alternative A, the federal funds
rate would move down to 4-1/2 percent, achieved either through a 1/2
percentage point cut in the discount rate with the same level of bor-
rowing as under alternative B or through open market operations that
lowered the borrowing level to $125 million. In the latter case, the
decline in the funds rate to 1/2 percentage point below the discount
rate would cause borrowing to fall to frictional levels. A bit more
volatility in the federal funds rate would be implied as the discount
window becomes a little less effective buffer to disturbances in the
reserves market.

tive A, the federal funds rate would drop to 2-3/4 percent. This could
be achieved by a reduction in the borrowing allowance to $225 million
with the funds rate dropping below the discount rate, or by a cut in the
discount rate of 1/2 percentage point with an unchanged borrowing al-
lowance. Alternative C involves a return of the federal funds rate to

1992-12-22,6,"(6) Three alternatives are presented below for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to
trade around 3 percent, in association with the allowance for adjustment
and seasonal borrowing remaining at $50 million. (Seasonal borrowing
ordinarily would be expected to edge down in January, but with such
borrowing already at a very low level of about $20 million, little
change is likely over the intermeeting period.) Alternative A incor-
porates a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate.
Such a reduction could be accomplished through open market operations--
by lowering the borrowing allowance by $25 million--pushing the federal
funds rate below the discount rate. The lower funds rate also could be
achieved by reducing the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point and
leaving the borrowing allowance unchanged. The latter approach would be
in line with the Committee's usual procedure, as it would not involve
moving the intended federal funds rate below the discount rate. The 1/2
percentage point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C
could be implemented by raising the borrowing allowance by $25 million.

","alternative B, Alternative C"
1996-11-13,6,"(6) If the Committee views the staff forecast as both likely and
acceptable, it presumably would favor standing pat--alternative B.
Even if the Committee found unacceptable the forecasted upcreep in
core inflation (abstracting from technical CPI adjustments), it might
want to wait for more evidence that such an outcome is in train before
taking action. The overutilization of resources may be seen as
staying modest in any event, and thus policy inaction at this meeting
would not seem to risk allowing inflation to rise so much that jarring
adjustments to employment and output would be required eventually.
","alternative B"
1997-08-19,6,"(6) With the risks apparently still tilted toward higher inflation, this document
presents the two basic policy options discussed in recent bluebooks: no change and tighter.
Under alternative B, the intended federal funds rate would be kept at its current level of 5-1/2
percent. Under alternative C, it would be boosted to 5-3/4 percent, either through reduced
provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1997-09-30,6,"(6) The staff assessment of the pressures on resources implies that policy restraint
is in order at some point to check an upcreep in inflation, but the Committee may,
nonetheless, prefer to hold the federal funds rate at its current level of 5-1/2 percent at this
meeting, as in alternative B. Over the past few quarters sustained high levels of resource
utilization have been associated with flat or, by some measures, even declining inflation. The
Committee may read this experience as suggesting the possibility that economic activity can
run on the high side of historical norms without putting much pressure on inflation. Even in
the staff forecast some of the moderate pickup in consumer prices owes to a smaller drag
from import prices as, by assumption, the dollar stabilizes. Additional impetus to inflation
comes from a projected further decline in the unemployment rate. Given these uncertainties
attending the prospects for inflation, the Committee might be willing to defer putting restraint
in place so as to get more readings on the pace of stock-building, the strength of final sales,
and the behavior of wages and prices. A willingness to await new information might be
reinforced if the Committee were of the view that any current misalignment of policy was
modest at worst. Some reassurance in this regard might be gotten from the likelihood that the
real fed funds rate has ticked higher in recent months, as inflation expectations seem to have
declined along with the drop in measured inflation, while the nominal funds rate has been
held steady. With scant indications of pipeline pressures that normally presage a pickup in
inflation, and with business profit margins perhaps ample enough to absorb a portion of any
speed up in cost increases, the Committee may well have time to act before an incipient
increase in inflation becomes firmly embedded in inflation expectations.
","alternative B"
1998-08-18,6,"(6) If the Committee found the staff forecast, with inflation and unemployment both
staying relatively low, to be both a reasonable expectation and a desirable outcome, it
presumably would maintain the current 51/2 percent federal funds rate, as under alternative B.
The Committee could still favor alternative B even if it saw higher inflation eventually, but was
rather uncertain about its expectation of the eventual pickup in inflation, given the surprisingly
favorable price performance of recent years. The odds on a significant price acceleration within a
year or so may be seen as low; in such circumstances, delay would not materially jeopardize the
Committee's goal of containing inflation and would buy some time to accumulate information on
the evolving dynamics of inflation and hence the need for tightening. Moreover, the Committee
may want to weigh any concerns about higher inflation against the increasingly precarious
conditions in global financial markets. The greater fragility of these markets evident over the
intermeeting period may suggest that the potential for adverse effects of a tightening of U.S.
monetary policy on other economies has risen further.

the Federal funds rate, expected to be consistent over the next few
weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are noted below. The
large increases in the money stock, given the Federal funds rate, depend
mainly on the resurgence in economic activity expected to result from the
catch-up in GM auto output during the first quarter. How strong a
resurgence will develop and how such a temporary bulge will affect
money demand are additional uncertainties that compound the usual
difficulties of specifying relationships between money market conditions
and monetary aggregates.

up the M1 shortfall. The first column--called alternative A--makes up the
shortfall by March and continues with a 6 per cent rate of growth in the
second quarter. The second column, alternative B, shows a path which does
not make up the shortfall by March; in other words, this alternative does
not retain as a target the March average level of M 1 set at the previous two
FOMC meetings. It does assume, however, that growth in M 1 would be greater
than 6 per cent in the second quarter as the shortfalls of the fourth
quarter and January are made up over a longer period. The particular path
would reach the same average level in June for M1 as indicated for
alternative A. And the growth rate over the 9 months from September
growth rates for the second quarter and the June level could, of course,
be greater if the Committee should decide that a trend growth rate of
more than 6 per cent is desirable for the longer run.

target. The Federal funds rates assumed to be consistent with the various
monetary aggregate paths are all somewhat higher than specified at the
time of the last FOMC meeting for given second quarter growth rates in
M1 . This is partly because demand for M1 in March was stronger than
anticipated under prevailing money market conditions. The funds rates
have been moved up more for alternatives B and C, since these alternatives
involve a slowing in the M 1 growth rate over the second quarter from the
recent pace and since there is one month less than there was at the time
of the last meeting to affect public demand for cash balances in the

","alternative A"
1971-10-19,7,"(7) Short-term credit demands are likely to expand in the fourth
quarter both for seasonal reasons and as business activity improves cycllically.
But we would not expect such demands to be reflected in much, if any, near-
term upward pressure on Treasury bill or private short-term rates. The
peak period of seasonal pressure on short-term markets normally comes after
mid-November. Also, the Treasury's mid-November refunding--to be announced
on October 27--may reduce short-term market pressures by emphasizing debt
lengthening, perhaps partly through incorporation of an advance refunding.
On the other hand, the Treasury could announce in conjunction with the
refunding that it will raise cash around mid-November through a bill issue.
On balance, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4
per cent range between now and the next meeting of the Committee, given the
money market specifications of alternative A. This bill rate range assumes
no substantial bill sales by foreign central banks.

This language differs from that adopted at the last meeting (as amended
on December 20) by omitting references to the ""months ahead"" and to
international developments, and it would be associated with different
money market specifications. Omission of the reference to ""months
ahead"" is suggested if the Committee wishes to emphasize prompt attain-
ment of a desired rate of growth for M1 the aggregate hitherto lagging.
The reference to international developments is omitted because reflows
of funds from abroad have not been showing signs of becoming a disturbing
influence on monetary policy. To the extent that pressures from this
source do in fact develop, it is thought that past Committee discussion
gives the Manager sufficient flexibility to cope with them.
","alternative A"
1972-09-19,7,"(7) The ensuing paragraphs present various trade-offs between
interest rates and growth in monetary and reserve aggregates. At one limit,
(alternative A), we have shown an expansion in monetary aggregates that involves
essentially no change between now and the first quarter of 1973 in money
market conditions from those recently prevailing. At the other limit
(alternative D), we have shown an M1 path under which growth is curtailed
to a 6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year; this path
implies a full percentage point rise in the Federal fund rate between now
and the next meeting. There are a number of possibilities in between.
Alternative B and C are two, and they involve both a more gradual slowing in
the monetary aggregate and a more gradual tightening of money market con-
","alternative A, Alternative B"
1973-03-19,7,"(7) Given the cumulative impact of monetary restraint, the
staff believes that growth in the monetary aggregates at the rates shown for
alternative B would involve little further change in money market conditions.
Growth in M 1 for the March-April period is indicated at 5-1/2--7-1/2
per cent in this alternative, ranging a little above the longer-run
target. This is due primarily to the assumed effect of larger-than-
usual income tax refunds this year, which will also bolster time and savings
deposits. RPD growth in the March-April period consistent with these
aggregates is projected to be relatively large, however, partly because it
reflects a further sharp increase in large CD's, and also because of the
effects of lagged reserve accounting.

key variables are shown below in summary form for Committee consideration
(with figures for aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual
rates of change). Of the alternatives shown, alternative B--which is
indexed by a long-run growth rate of 5-1/4 per cent for M 1--represents
essentially a continuation of longer-run monetary targets adopted by
the Committee at its last meeting (stipulated at the time as 5--5-1/2
per cent for M1). Alternative A represents an easing of policy, and

These longer-run growth rates assume the staff GNP projection and further
assume that the funds rate reaches levels at about the mid-point of the

1975-06-16,7,"(7) Alternative longer-run growth rates for the monetary
aggregates covering the 12-month period from June 1975 to June 1976
are summarized in the table below for Committee consideration.
Alternative B encompasses generally the same growth rates that had
been adopted by the Committee for the March '75--March '76 period at
its April meeting. The M1 growth range--at 5 to 7½ per cent--is exactly
the same, but minor downward adjustments have been made to growth ranges
for other monetary and credit aggregates. These adjustments take
account of changing relationships among the aggregates based on the
up-dated longer-run time period and re-assessment of the economic and
financial outlook.

rate of 15 per cent through the second quarter of 1976, it seems highly
probable that longer-run growth in M1 can be contained within the Committee's
further as the period progresses. For this reason none of the short-run
policy options presented contemplates an easing of money market rates
from recent levels. Under alternative A, the average funds rate would
remain close to recently prevailing levels for the time being, but

continuing shifts of corporate funds from demand deposits to savings accounts.
The expected range of M1 growth reflects our assumption that such shifts may

expectation that the pace at which funds are transferred out of demand accounts

in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range. Tax refunds are likely to con-
tribute somewhat to growth in demand deposits in March. As April progresses,
however, payments by the Treasury will probably be moderating and might be
more than offset by the public's drawing down balances that had been built
up by earlier refunds. Thus, M 1 growth during the March-April period is
expected to depend essentially on transactions demands associated with
the projected relatively rapid expansion in nominal GNP. Our expectation
for money growth over the next two months assumes some continued downward
shift in money demand.

1976-09-21,7,"(7) With economic activity projected to expand at a moderate
rate over the next few months, M1 is also expected to continue rising
over the September-October period at a rate little different from that
of recent months. Under alternative B, given prevailing money market
conditions--as indexed by a Federal funds rate around 5¼ per cent--
M1 will probably grow in a 4-8 per cent annual rate range.
","alternative B"
1976-12-20,7,"(7) Alternative B assumes that prevailing money market
conditions--indexed by a Federal funds rate around 4-5/8 per cent--
would be maintained between now and the next Committee meeting. M1
in the December-January period would, in consequence, be expected to
expand in a 2½-6½ per cent annual rate range. The mid-point of that
growth range is close to the average rate of growth in M1 over the
past six months--a period when the rate of expansion in nominal GNP
had slowed. A faster growth in M1 is expected to develop later in the
winter in reflection of the pick-up in economic expansion that is
currently projected by the staff.
","Alternative B"
1977-02-15,7,"(7) Growth in M1 over the February-March period is expected
to be in a 3-7 per cent annual rate range, assuming a Federal funds
rate centered in a 4¼-5 per cent range, as in alternative B. The rate
of expansion that is anticipated for M1 reflects in part the retardation
in economic activity caused by the recent cold snap and associated fuel
","alternative B"
1977-03-15,7,"(7) Assuming the Federal funds rate remains around 4-5/8 per
cent--the midpoint of the alternative B range--we expect M1 growth
in the March-April period to accelerate and be at an annual rate in a
view of the strengthening in economic activity that appears to be in
process. Tax rebates are not likely to be disbursed until May, and thus
will not directly influence monetary growth rates in March and April. The
rebates will have a substantial effect on growth in money in the following
months; alternative projections of their impact on M1 and M2 over the
spring and summer will be shown in next month's blue book. At the moment
the staff is tentatively estimating that the rebates will raise the
second-quarter growth rate in M1 (relative to what it otherwise would be)
by about 2 percentage points, and lower the third-quarter rate by about
the same amount. (Such estimated impacts are included in the tables on
pages 5 and 6.)
","alternative B"
1977-04-19,7,"(7) Alternative B encompasses a one-year growth rate for M1
of 4½-6½ per cent, the same range as is currently in place. However,
growth ranges for M2 and M3 under this alternative are lower--by ½ percen-
tage point for M2 and 1 percentage point for M3 . Lower ranges for the
broader aggregates relative to M1 are expected mainly because the new
ranges now apply to a period that excludes QIV '76, when relatively low
market rates produced large inflows of time and savings deposits at
depository institutions, and instead includes QI '78, when relatively
high market interest rates are expected to dampen such flows.1/
","Alternative B, alternative a"
1977-09-20,7,"(7) Assuming a Federal funds rate centered in the 5¾-6½ per
cent range specified for alternative B, M-1 over the September-October
period is expected to expand in a 5-9 per cent annual rate range. Incoming
data suggest that M-1 will grow at about a 6½ per cent annual rate in
September, and the staff would anticipate a slight acceleration to about
a 7½ per cent annual rate in October. Strength in the demand for M-1 is
likely to be sustained in the fall, given the pick-up in growth of nominal
GNP that is projected and recent indications that the public may be
reducing the extent to which it is shifting out of M-1 into other liquid

1978-01-17,7,"(7) Alternative B encompasses the ranges for all of the
aggregates adopted by the Committee in October for the QIII '77-
QIII '78 period. The ranges for M-2 and M-3 now assume an upward
adjustment of one-half percentage point in ceiling rates on small
denomination time deposits in the first half of the year. Without
such an adjustment, the increase in market interest rates thought
necessary to restrain M-1 growth to the mid-point of its indicated
range would--given associated projections for time deposit flows into
banks and thrift institutions--lead to growth in M-2 and M-3 at rates
near or below the lower ends of the ranges shown.1 / Alternatives A

policy alternatives; both also assume the upward adjustment in ceiling
","Alternative B"
1978-02-28,7,"(8) Alternative B continues the ranges for M-1 and M-2
that were adopted by the Committee in October for the QIII '77-QIII '78
period. Alternatives A and C represent, respectively, somewhat more and
somewhat less expansive policy alternatives. Under all three
alternatives, the M-3 growth range is projected to be lower than
the current range for this aggregate. Since around year end, net
inflows of deposits to thrift institutions have persisted at a rate
considerably lower than previously anticipated, and, as a result, the
staff has reduced its projections of such inflows over the year ahead.
","Alternative B"
1978-03-21,7,"(7) Each of the alternatives is consistent with the growth
ranges for QIV '77 to QIV '78--as indexed by M-1 growth in a 4 to 6½
per cent range--adopted by the Committee at its February meeting and
each requires that interest rates would rise over the balance of
the year in order to constrain growth in the aggregates to the mid-
point of the longer-run ranges. Under alternative B, the Federal
funds rate would be expected to remain unchanged over the inter-
meeting period and then begin rising thereafter, reaching about 8
per cent by fall. The near-term decline in the funds rate contemplated

under alternative A would likely require a greater rise in this
rate over the summer and fall. Under alternative C, restraint would
begin earlier; thus the required upward adjustments in the funds
rate over 1978 would be somewhat less.1/ The levels of interest
rates consistent with each alternative imply continued relatively
slow growth of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings
at banks and thrift institutions, even though the projections of
deposit aggregates assume a 50 basis point increase in time deposit
ceiling rates in the months ahead.

Alternative B would continue the ranges for M-1 and M-2 adopted
by the Committee in February for the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period. The
longer-run range for M-3 has been reduced, however, largely because

1978-05-16,7,"(8) Growth in M-1 is expected to slow considerably over
the two-month May-June period from the extraordinary April rate, partly
because the temporary impact of tax-related factors should be unwinding.
Under alternative A--which encompasses a range for the Federal funds
rate centered on its recently prevailing level of around 7-3/8 per
cent--M-1 is expected to expand in a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate
range over the May-June period. Given this projection, the level
of M-1 in each month of the second quarter would be above
levels implied by the FOMC's longer-run range, as shown in
Chart 1 on the following page. Growth in M-1 in the second quarter
would be at a 9¼ per cent annual rate, reflecting for the most
part the sharp rebound in economic activity this quarter, when
nominal GNP is now anticipated to expand at a 17½ per cent annual

1978-10-17,7,"(7) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary
aggregates over the one-year QIII '78 to QIII '79 period are shown
below for Committee consideration. M-1 ranges shown in the top line
reflect staff estimates of the expected shift from demand deposits to
savings deposits over the year ahead as a result of the introduction of
the automatic transfer service (ATS) on November 1, while M-1 ranges
that abstract from the estimated impact of ATS are shown in parentheses
in the second line. The upper limits of the ranges on the top line are
noticeably lower than those on the second line because the staff
believes that some significant shift from demand to savings deposits
as a result of ATS will almost assuredly occur, as explained in paragraph
uncertain size of this shift. Alternative B is based on the same growth
rate range for M-1 as adopted by the Committee in July for the QII '78
to QII '79 period, while alternatives A and C encompass, respectively,

in reconsidering the monetary aggregate targets for 1982 are retention of

higher ranges (shown as alternative B).1/ The desirability of higher ranges
depends in part on whether it is thought that the strong demands for
liquidity of the first half of the year--reflected in declines in velocity
of both M1 and M2--are likely to abate. It also depends, of course, on the
degree of monetary restraint the Committee deems appropriate under current

reserve positions--calls for growth in M1 that would keep this aggregate
at the midpoint of the Ccmmittee's long-run range, with M2 moving a
little higher in its range, though remaining below the midpoint, and M3
continuing near the upper end of its range. Alternative A calls for
somewhat faster money growth over the September-to-December period,
consistent with an easing in reserve pressures, while alternative C
contemplates somewhat slower money growth, associated with tighter reserve
conditions. Given the proximity of the end of the year, under all the
alternatives growth in M1 for the year would not be far from the 6 per-
cent midpoint of the Committee's long-run range, M2 would be expected to
remain around 7 percent--in the lower half of its long-run range-and M3

cluding implied growth for the QIV 1983-to-QIV 1984 period and for October

contemplate growth in this aggregate over the three-month September-to-December
period well below the short-run objective specified by the Committee at its

short-run objectives. Alternative A involves an initial easing in bank
reserve positions, while no substantial change is contemplated by alternative
B. No alternative that would initially tighten bank reserve positions is
presented in view of the size of recent shortfalls in M1 and M2, with both

aggregates is expected to be consistent with seasonal plus adjustment
borrowing at the discount window of $300 to $350 million, assuming that
borrowing by privately-insured thrift institutions experiencing persistent
liquidity difficulties is in effect extended credit. Total reserves

increasing at 8 percent rate.

1985-08-20,7,"(7) It seems unlikely, given recent developments, that the
Committee's June-to-September objective of 5 to 6 percent growth (annual
rate) for M1 can be attained short of a very sharp rise in the federal
funds rate to perhaps the 10 to 11 percent area. Assuming some slight
decrease in M1 in the second half of August, it would take about a 5
percent annual rate of decline in September for growth over the three
months to reach 6 percent. It is likely, however, that such a rise in
the funds rate would need to be reversed later in the year to sustain
economic activity, consistent with growth of M1 around the upper limit
of its range. The alternatives presented below are based on less extreme
movements in money and interest rates. Of the alternatives, B and C are
most consistent with moving near to or somewhat below the upper end of the
FOMC's 3 to 8 percent long-run range for M1 by the fourth quarter, although
the tighter alternative C would provide more assurance. Alternative A
would very probably involve growth for the second half above the Com-
mittee's M1 target. (More detailed data are shown in the following

money growth over the balance of the quarter is enbodied in all these
alternatives, but given the substantial expansion in April and early May,
achieving the Committee's existing specifications for the 3-month period
would require some contraction in M1 and M2. None of the alternatives
presented below assumes the extreme tightening in reserve conditions that
might be associated with an attempt to achieve such an outcome. Alterna-
tive B assumes maintenance of about current pressures on reserve positions,
while alternative A and alternative C contemplate a moderate easing and
tightening of reserve pressures, respectively. As shown in the more

","alternative A, alternative C, alternative B"
1987-12-15,7,"(7) Three alternatives for monetary policy are presented below for
Committee consideration. They are based on the options of maintaining
current reserve and money market conditions, or seeking somewhat easier
(alternative A) or somewhat tighter (alternative C) conditions. The
latter two alternatives are assumed to involve changes of approximately
associated adjustments of reserve pressures. Investor caution about
default risk and potential volatility may continue in financial markets
over the near term. In such circumstances, the apparent added reluc-
tance of banks to be seen tapping the discount window since the last
FOMC meeting also could persist. Moreover, year-end pressures may
affect bank reserve management and the movements of interest rates in
coming weeks. As a consequence, the relationship between the amount of
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing and the spread of the funds rate over
the discount rate is likely to remain unusually uncertain for awhile.
In constructing the alternatives, the staff has assumed that, if finan-
cial markets remain unusually sensitive and instability in the borrowing
relationship persists, the borrowing objective will continue to be
interpreted with some degree of flexibility in implementing open market
","alternative A, alternative C"
1988-03-29,7,"(7) Three short-run policy options are presented below. Alter-
native B would retain the $200 million assumption for adjustment plus
seasonal borrowing now used in constructing paths for nonborrowed reserves,
with federal funds rates remaining generally in the 6-1/2 percent area,
once any quarter-end pressures were past. Under alternative C, the
borrowing objective would be raised to $400 million and the funds rate
would move up to the vicinity of 7 percent. Under alternative A, federal
funds would be expected to trade around the current 6 percent discount
rate; this could be accomplished by reducing the discount rate by 1/2 point
while keeping the $200 million borrowing objective, or by decreasing this
objective. The staff estimates that borrowing on the order of $100 million
might represent the level associated with this alternative. However, this
estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty as we have very limited
experience with operating at borrowing around frictional levels. More-
over, at very low levels of borrowing, the funds rate might become quite
sensitive to relatively minor changes in borrowing behavior. Such changes
could include the normal pattern of seasonal credit as well as other
","alternative C, alternative A"
1988-05-17,7,"(7) The three policy alternatives presented below are geared to
unchanged, increased, and decreased pressures on reserve positions relative
to the Desk's current operating objective. The assumption for adjustment
plus seasonal borrowing would be kept at $400 million under alternative B
and would be raised or lowered by $200 million under alternatives C and A,
respectively. The federal funds rate would be expected to average around
alternatives C and A. These relations embody some continued reluctance of
banks to be seen at the discount window compared with patterns before the
stock market crash; to the extent this reluctance abates or is offset by
further unusually strong increases in seasonal credit, however, federal
funds rates consistent with these borrowing assumptions could average a
little lower.
","alternative B"
1988-08-16,7,"(7) Two policy alternatives are presented below. Alternative B
maintains the current $600 million assumption for adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing and alternative C increases intended borrowing to $800 million.
Under alternative B, a federal funds rate of around 8 percent would be
consistent with the average relationship that prevailed over the first half
of this year between borrowing and the funds rate-discount rate spread.
However, expectations of a further tightening of policy could persist under
alternative B, causing funds to trade somewhat higher, in an 8 to 8-1/4
percent range. Federal funds likely would trade between 8-1/2 and 8-3/4
percent under alternative C, perhaps more toward the lower end of this
range if the additional firming acted to dispel expectations of still
further near-term policy moves.
","Alternative B, alternative C, alternative B, alternative B, alternative C"
1988-09-20,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are presented below. Under alter-
native B, reserve paths would continue to be drawn with adjustment plus
seasonal borrowing of $600 million, while under alternatives A and C
reserve paths would embody borrowing levels of $400 million and $800 mil-
lion, respectively. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be
expected to continue to trade generally in the 8 to 8-1/4 percent area. In
the next few days, however, a tax-related surge in the Treasury balance
could push the funds rate briefly to or even above 8-1/4 percent, and
temporary pressures could resurface around quarter end. The funds rate
would fall to the 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent area under alternative A and rise
to the 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent area under alternative C.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1988-11-01,7,"(7) The standard three policy alternatives are presented
below. Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be built
with seasonal plus adjustment borrowing of $600 million, while under
alternatives A and C reserve paths would incorporate borrowing levels of
$400 million and $800 million, respectively.
","alternative B"
1989-05-16,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee
consideration. Under alternative B, funds would continue to trade in the
reserve market conditions are likely to involve borrowing of around $600
million. This technical adjustment to the borrowing objective from the
current $500 million level seems to be called for by the surge in seasonal
borrowing, which is expected to continue in the intermeeting period. In
the circumstances of still-low adjustment borrowing, the rise in seasonal
borrowing has reduced the overall borrowing shortfall that emerged last
fall. Uncertainty about the extent and effect of the increase in seasonal
borrowing as well as about the behavior of adjustment borrowing argues for
some continued flexibility by the Desk in the approach to the borrowing
objective. Under alternative A, the funds rate would decline to the 9-1/4
to 9-3/8 percent area with borrowing around $400 million, and under alter-
native C federal funds would rise to 10-1/4 to 10-3/8 percent and borrow-
ing to $800 million.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1990-03-27,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are presented for Committee con-
sideration. Under alternative B, maintaining federal funds trading around
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, the assumption used since the last
FOMC meeting in constructing reserve paths. Although seasonal borrowing
should increase over coming weeks, underlying demands for adjustment bor-
rowing, absent unusual settlement day pressures, are likely to remain
weak. Alternative A embodies a 7-3/4 percent federal funds rate and a
borrowing assumption of $100 million, while the 8-3/4 percent funds rate
of alternative C reflects borrowing of $200 million. Predicting the rela-
tionship between the federal funds rate and discount window borrowing
remains difficult, however, justifying continued flexibility in the Desk's
approach to the borrowing objective.
","alternative B, Alternative A, alternative C"
1990-05-15,7,"(7) Interest rates generally would be expected to show little
net change under alternative B. Market expectations now embody federal
funds continuing to trade around 8-1/4 percent, as under this alternative.
Similarly, incoming information on the economy consistent with the green-
book forecast would be roughly in line with the continued economic growth
and moderation in measured inflation--though with little improvement in
longer-term price trends--that market participants now seem to be antici-
pating. Rates on Treasury bills and notes, however, could be subject to
transitory supply pressures if RTC activity accelerates appreciably and
with it Treasury financing needs. A breakthrough in negotiations on the
budget between the Administration and the Congress in coming weeks would
be likely to spark a rally in capital markets, which after a time might
induce a downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
Absent such a breakthrough, the dollar likely would remain around recent
levels on foreign exchange markets; with the dollar stable and German
reunification impending, a tightening of monetary policy in Germany and
Japan before the next FOMC meeting appears unlikely.
","alternative B"
1990-10-02,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are given below for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to
trade around 8 percent. Under alternatives A and C, federal funds trading
would center around 7-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent, respectively. In view of the
decline in the demand for seasonal credit that typically occurs during the
fall, borrowing under alternative B would initially be specified at $450
million, a reduction of $50 million from the current level, and the
assumption probably would need to be lowered another $50 to $100 million
over the intermeeting period. Under alternatives A and C, the initial
specification for borrowing would be $400 million and $500 million,
respectively. Desk operations over the intermeeting period may need to
take account of continued cautious reserve management by banks concerned
about potential funding difficulties; those banks may want to carry a
larger cushion of excess reserves and would be especially eager to avoid
being seen at the discount window.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1991-08-20,7,"(7) Two alternatives are presented below for Committee con-
sideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to
trade around 5-1/2 percent, at the discount rate, in association with
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $375 million.4  Under alter-
native A, the federal funds rate would decline to 5 percent. The
money market conditions of this alternative could be achieved through
a reduction in borrowing to $325 million or through a 1/2 percentage
point cut in the discount rate, holding borrowing at $375 million.
There are no technical impediments to an easing of policy through open
market operations alone--dropping the federal funds rate 50 basis
points below the discount rate--although a little more volatility in
the funds rate likely would be a by-product, as the discount window
became a less effective buffer of reserve market disturbances.
","alternative B, alternative c"
1991-10-01,7,"(7) Two short-run policy alternatives are presented below
for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, the federal funds
rate would be expected to remain centered on 5-1/4 percent, in as-
sociation with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $325 million.7  Under alternative A, federal funds
would tend to trade around 4-3/4 percent, which could be fostered
either by lowering the borrowing specification by $50 million to $275
million or by lowering the discount rate by a further 1/2 point to
the present spread of the funds rate over the discount rate and thus
the current degree of cushioning of transitory shocks to the supply
and demand for reserves.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1992-08-18,7,"(7) Market sentiment of late seems to have tilted toward some
prospect of another policy ease in coming months. Although money market
interest rates might firm a bit over the intermeeting period under the
unchanged policy of alternative B, any increase would be limited if,
consistent with the Greenbook forecast, information continued to suggest
modest economic expansion. Bond rates also should remain around their
current reduced levels, and could even edge down if inaction by the
Federal Reserve, along with indicators of wages and prices, were seen as
reinforcing disinflationary trends. If political dynamics seem to
portend even higher budget deficits ahead, these downward pressures on
bond yields may tend to be offset. The dollar, under alternative B,
would be expected to trade around its recent lower levels.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1992-12-22,7,"(7) In view of the stronger tone of economic data in recent
weeks, market participants seem to be anticipating a firming in the
stance of monetary policy some time next year, but likely not between
now and the early February FOMC meeting. With an unchanged federal
funds rate under alternative B, other private short-term rates will
decline over the intermeeting period as remaining year-end pressures
unwind. Apart from year-end effects, rates along the maturity spectrum
might tend to drift lower should developments unfold as in the staff
forecast; in these circumstances, expectations of substantial policy
tightening in 1993 are likely to fade, albeit slowly, as inflation re-
mains subdued and the pace of expansion stays moderate. Intermediate-
and longer-term rates may be importantly influenced by new proposals on
fiscal policy. Markets apparently are anticipating some modest fiscal
stimulus, but there is considerable uncertainty about the size of any
short-term package and the scope and credibility of proposals for
longer-term deficit reduction. Interest rates could also be affected by
discussions of other policy measures apparently being considered by the
new Administration, which also have not been assumed in the staff fore-
cast. For example, efforts to increase bank lending by relaxing regula-
tions, intended to ease the cost and availability of credit to borrowers
dependent on banks, might boost some market interest rates if such a
relaxation were seen as having a significant impact on spending and as
shifting bank portfolios toward loans and away from government
securities. Proposals to put greater emphasis on shorter maturities in
Treasury debt management, while motivated primarily by possible saving
in federal interest expense, may flatten the yield curve a little.
","alternative B"
1993-03-23,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would
continue to trade around 3 percent in association with the allowance for
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially remaining at $50 million.
The allowance probably will need to be revised upward over the inter-
meeting period when demands for seasonal credit strengthen during the
spring. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to
the 2-1/2 percent area. This alternative could be implemented through a
borrowing allowance at the same level as in alternative B, or by
lowering the initial borrowing allowance to $25 million and leaving the
discount rate unchanged. Alternative C, involving a rise in the federal
funds rate to 3-1/2 percent, could be implemented through a boost in the
initial borrowing allowance to $75 million.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative c, alternative B, Alternative C"
1993-08-17,7,"(7) Market participants are not expecting a change in policy
over the relatively short upcoming intermeeting period. Thus, under
alternative B, short-term interest rates should remain around current
levels in the weeks ahead. The prime rate, at 6 percent, is unlikely to
move, as banks' increased willingness to lend will probably take the
form of narrower spreads relative to benchmark rates and more attractive
nonprice terms. Although the passage of the deficit reduction package
has removed one element of uncertainty, questions remain about its
effects, suggesting that rates could be quite sensitive to information
bearing on household and business spending. Currently, market partici-
pants appear to be anticipating a tightening of monetary policy by early
next year, on the presumption that short-term rates will have to move up
to forestall any incipient buildup of inflation pressures. Given these
expectations, intermediate- and perhaps long-term rates could drift
lower if, in line with the staff economic forecast, incoming indicators
point to more subdued spending and inflationary pressures than now seem
built into market expectations; in such circumstances, market partici-
pants would likely see tightening actions as being pushed further into
the future. The dollar should trade around recent levels on foreign
exchange markets, with any downward pressure from possible declines in
U.S. interest rates being balanced by projected reductions in rates
","alternative B"
1993-09-21,7,"(7) Alternative B is consistent with the staff's economic
forecast. In that forecast, short-term rates are assumed to remain at
current levels through the end of 1994. Growth in output settles into a
pace broadly in line with that of potential output, preserving the
current modest slack in resource markets. Accordingly, core inflation
edges lower. Market participants apparently believe that the federal
funds rate will remain at 3 percent, at least for the next several
months, and under alternative B, money market interest rates would
remain around current levels. However, participants seem to expect
stronger economic growth over coming months than implicit in the staff
forecast and little further progress in reducing inflation. In the
absence of stronger growth, intermediate- and longer-term rates might
well drift lower as incoming data tilt market sentiment and investors
continue to reach for yield. Bond yields could remain unusually
volatile for a time as market participants continue to assess the
sustainability of the much reduced levels of long-term rates that have
recently been reached. This skittishness may focus particularly on
indicators bearing on the outlook for prices, partly in light of their
possible implications for monetary policy going forward. Consistent
with the staff forecast of policy easings in Germany and Japan, the
dollar should trade on the high side of recent levels under alterna-
tive B.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1993-11-16,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are presented for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would
continue to trade around 3 percent.10  This alternative is consistent
with the monetary policy assumption of a steady federal funds rate for
several quarters ahead that underlies the greenbook projection of eco-
nomic activity and inflation. In that forecast, real GDP growth settles
into a 2-1/2 percent pace next year, as the stimulus imparted by past
interest rate declines and diminishing balance-sheet and credit supply
constraints about offsets the drag from continued fiscal retrenchment;
the unemployment rate remains around 6-3/4 percent, and core inflation
edges down. Market participants generally seem to believe that the
economic expansion will run a little faster than projected by the staff
and to avoid a pickup in inflation down the road the Federal Reserve
will begin to firm reserve conditions in the first half of next year.
If economic and inflation data over coming months instead prove to be
closer to the staff forecast, bond yields probably will retrace some of
their recent runup.
","alternative B"
1993-12-21,7,"(7) Alternative B is consistent with the policy assumptions
underlying the staff economic forecast. In that forecast, short-term
rates are maintained at around current levels through most of 1994.
The spurt in output in the current quarter, related importantly to
production adjustments in the automobile industry, is not sustained.
Output decelerates in the first quarter, and then settles into a
growth pace broadly in line with that of potential over the balance of
the year, held down to an extent by scheduled fiscal retrenchment.
With economic slack persisting, albeit at around the current
diminished level, prices decelerate modestly further. Relative to the
staff forecast, market participants appear to be anticipating a bit
more strength in aggregate demand through next year, and have built
into interest rates substantial odds that policy will begin to tighten
in the first part of the year to keep inflation from increasing.
Nonetheless, market interest rates are unlikely to move down much on
balance under the steady funds rate of alternative B in coming months,
since the market would continue to expect a tightening before long.
The foreign exchange value of the dollar under alternative B should
stay around current levels.

","Alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1994-11-15,7,"(7) Two monetary policy alternatives for Committee considera-
tion are presented formally below. Alternative B would keep the
intended federal funds rate unchanged at 4-3/4 percent, in association
with retaining an allowance of $225 million for adjustment plus sea-
sonal borrowing at the discount window.4  Alternative C embodies a
accomplished either by an equal rise in the discount rate to 4-1/2
percent with the borrowing allowance kept at $225 million or by an
increase in the borrowing allowance to $275 million at the current
discount rate of 4 percent. A still larger increase in the federal
funds rate than envisioned under alternative C is also discussed.
","Alternative B, Alternative C, alternative C"
1994-12-20,7,"(7) Two policy alternatives are presented below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Alternative B would keep the intended
federal funds rate at 5-1/2 percent. The associated level of adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing would initially be $125 million, but
borrowing would subsequently drift lower in keeping with the typical
winding down of demands for seasonal credit. Alternative C entails a
either through an equivalent increase in the discount rate with the
same path for the borrowing allowance or an increase in the initial
borrowing allowance to $175 million, with the same seasonal reductions
","Alternative B, Alternative C"
1995-03-28,7,"(7) Three policy alternatives are considered below. Under
alternative B, federal funds trading would continue around 6 percent,
in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $75 mil-
lion.6 Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would be in-
creased to 6-1/2 percent by raising either the borrowing allowance to
$125 million or the discount rate by 50 basis points. Alternative A,
involving a reduction of the intended funds rate to 5-1/2 percent,
could be effected by lowering either the borrowing allowance to $50
million or the discount rate by 50 basis points.
","alternative B, alternative C, Alternative A"
1995-05-23,7,"(7) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented below
for consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal
funds would continue to trade around 6 percent. Under alternative C,
the federal funds rate would be boosted 1/2 percentage point, to 6-1/2
percent. Alternative A would reduce the intended trading level of the
funds rate to 5-1/2 percent. 7
","alternative B, alternative C, Alternative A"
1996-11-13,7,"(7) With market participants widely expecting policy to remain
on hold for some time, the Committee's selection of alternative B
should elicit little response in financial markets. Assuming that
developments over the intermeeting period play out in accord with the
staff projection, which appears aligned with most market forecasts,
there is no reason to anticipate that interest rates will break out of
their recent range. Similarly, the dollar should trade on foreign
exchange markets around its recent levels.
","alternative B"
1997-03-25,7,"(7) Nonetheless, a number of considerations regarding the outlook might induce the
Committee to forgo tightening at the March meeting, as under alternative B. The fact that
resource utilization rates have been close to current levels for several quarters, with no sign
that the underlying trend of price inflation is moving higher, might suggest that the economy
may not in fact have overshot its long-run potential. In light of this possibility, the
Committee may want to wait to see more definite indications that price pressures are likely to
intensify before tightening--for example, additional increases in resource utilization or in wage
inflation. Moreover, even if a tightening is needed, the Committee may perceive no urgency,
especially in light of the projected decline in total CPI inflation this year, which, in turn,
would help restrain inflation expectations. Were the Committee to wait to see if the
unemployment rate declines, or if temporary factors damping compensation growth like health
care savings or worker insecurity diminish, sufficient lead time may still be available to
prevent tight labor markets from being translated into a materially higher rate of general price
inflation. Even should the upturn in wage inflation already observed be sustained or become
steeper, it still could be largely absorbed for a time in reduced profit margins or matched by
faster productivity growth, rather than passed through quickly to prices. Finally, the
enthusiasm of international investors for the dollar may prove more lasting than anticipated by
the staff, restraining inflation pressures in 1998 and beyond relative to the staff forecast.
","alternative B"
1997-09-30,7,"(7) If the Committee were confident that the staff had correctly identified the threat
that inflation would pick up, or wanted some greater assurance of further progress toward
price stability, it would likely favor raising the federal funds rate promptly, perhaps at this
meeting by the 25 basis points of alternative C. The need for prompt action might be seen
as elevated because the vigor of final sales threatens to add to pressures on resources, and the
longer the economy operates beyond its sustainable potential, the more disruptive may be the
correction needed to contain inflation. Despite relatively high short-term real rates, financial
conditions remain quite supportive to spending: The stock market continues to generate
impressive gains in wealth; longer-term real interest rates seem to have held fairly steady or
perhaps edged lower since spring; and capital markets and depositories remain quite receptive
to borrowers. The rapid growth of the monetary aggregates in the past few months may be
seen as one more warning flag that financial conditions are supporting more spending than
can be accommodated without an increase of inflation. While the Committee might be more
inclined than ever to view structural changes as permitting the economy to operate at a higher
rate than in the past, the projected unemployment rate of 4-1/2 percent falls short of all but
the rosiest estimates of the natural rate. Moreover, a portion of the recent good performance
of inflation has owed to temporary factors, such as the strength in the foreign exchange value
of the dollar, which are not likely to be repeated over coming quarters. Even worker
insecurity may be expected to erode in a strong labor market marked by reduced layoffs.
With those beneficial forces likely to wind down, the Committee may fear that the effects of
strains on resources may show through more forcefully to the prices of goods and services
than in the staff forecast, perhaps more in line with traditional relationships.
","alternative C"
1998-08-18,7,"(7) With inflation low, aggregate demand apparently decelerating, and the outlook for
Asia quite uncertain, market participants anticipate no policy action at this meeting, and market
interest rates are likely to be little affected by selection of alternative B. Under the Greenbook
forecast, information about prospective corporate earnings is likely to disappoint investors,
keeping equity prices from rebounding and possibly precipitating a further decline. Absent such
a decline, which could weaken the exchange value of the dollar as investments in the United
States looked less desirable, the dollar should edge higher in coming months, most notably
against the yen: The Japanese economy is likely to remain weak and skeptical market
participants probably will require substantial, concrete actions to deal with the financial system
and the economy before confidence can begin to recover. Should troubles in foreign markets
intensify and spread further, the dollar would tend to strengthen more noticeably, equity prices
would encounter additional downward pressures amid heightened worries about profits, and
interest rates in the United States would continue to decline across the yield curve, reflecting
both a more pronounced flight to quality and developing expectations of monetary policy easing.
","alternative B"
1998-09-29,7,"(7) To begin addressing the weaker outlook for the U.S. economy, the Committee
may wish to reduce the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, as in alternative A. Now that
the stock market has fallen and credit terms have tightened, the real federal funds rate probably
can be reduced from its unusually high level without adding to inflation pressures. Indeed, with
inflation expectations possibly falling further in recent months--as suggested by a much larger
decline in the spread of nominal over indexed Treasury yields than can be accounted for by the
relative liquidity of these instruments-the real federal funds rate may even have edged higher.
Even if the Committee's outlook for spending is stronger than that of the staff, if it has been
revised down substantially, a policy ease might still be called for. Moreover, financial markets
are fragile and, in the absence of signs of economic recovery and progress on key policy reforms
in Japan and other countries, the possibilities for disappointing outcomes abroad precipitating
further contagion and restraint on spending in the United States may be seen as unacceptably
high. A 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this point could be viewed as providing a modicum
of insurance against the risk of such very adverse outcomes. In addition to boosting domestic
demand, a lower federal funds rate could be of some limited help in relieving pressures on
emerging market countries, especially those tied to the dollar or finding themselves in need of
defending the exchange value of their currencies through tight monetary policies. Indeed, in
recent days as an easing by the Federal Reserve has come to be seen as more likely, emerging
market countries have witnessed some narrowing in spreads on their dollar-denominated debt
and some improvement in their stock markets. If foreign outcomes proved not so disappointing
or the domestic economy surprisingly resilient, the policy move could be reversed before long
without raising questions about the Federal Reserve's anti-inflation resolve. Even if the
Committee suspected that more easing might eventually be needed, it might want to move by
only 25 basis points at this time because of the residual inflation risks inherent in the unusually
low unemployment rate along with the strength to date in the economic expansion.
","alternative A"
1999-02-02,7,"(7) This section considers alternative longer-term strategies for monetary policy and
highlights some important risks to the outlook. The staff FRB/US model is used to extend the
Greenbook forecast for a number of years and to examine both a policy designed to achieve price
stability and the effects of alternative assumptions about important features of aggregate demand
and supply.
","alternative a"
1999-03-30,7,"(7) Despite the likelihood that overall inflation will rise, the Committee might choose
the unchanged policy stance of alternative B at this meeting. A good part of that rise will owe to
the recent increase in oil prices; most measures of wage and price inflation have ticked lower of
late, which should help to contain inflation expectations; and the projected rebound in core
inflation is gradual. These considerations suggest that deferring action in the near term would
not unduly worsen underlying inflation trends. The Committee might see important benefits
from that delay if it thought that only a modest policy adjustment was necessary and wanted to
use the time to build a case for such action with the public, thereby fostering a more measured
reaction in financial markets than would ensue with unanticipated action. Inaction would be
particularly attractive to the Committee if it suspected that the price outlook in the Greenbook
was more likely to be subject to further favorable surprises than to adverse ones, implying that
firmer evidence of an impending acceleration in prices would be desirable before tightening
policy. Indeed, the Committee may be of the opinion that the staff has built in too large an uptick
to inflation, perhaps by placing too little emphasis on the disinflationary force of ample industrial
capacity and the market discipline now exerted on the ability of firms to pass along price
increases, or by giving too much credence to the power of oil producers to enforce their recent
curbs on supply.
","alternative B"
1999-10-05,7,"(7) While the Committee is likely to view an inflation outcome like that in the
staff forecast as unacceptable, it still may choose to keep the stance of policy unchanged, as
in alternative B. The staff outlook for inflation may strike the Committee as plausible but
surrounded by an unusually large element of uncertainty, which may be reduced by the
accumulation of additional evidence with the passage of time. On the demand side of the
economy, the changes in financial conditions this year have been substantial and have not
yet had much time to work themselves through to spending. On the supply side, the risks
may be considered to be tilted toward lower inflation than in the staff forecast: Four-
quarter increases in core inflation, productivity, and unit labor costs have remained
favorable to date, highlighting the possibility that a further strengthening of the secular
growth in labor productivity may continue to repress inflationary pressures for some time
longer. In addition, the Committee may judge that faster productivity growth actually has
represented a more significant influence damping inflation relative to various one-time
factors, such as falling oil or non-oil import prices, than the staff has estimated. If so, the
reversal of those factors that is now in train might put less upward pressure on broad price
movements than in the staff forecast. Moreover, recent declines in stock prices and rising
risk spreads on some corporate bonds seem to have reflected a heightened investor
edginess; in these circumstances, the Committee may be more inclined to keep policy on
hold so as not to add to market unease through an unexpected policy tightening.
","alternative B"
1999-12-21,7,"(7) Given the circumstances of the looming century date change, the economic
outlook might not weigh as significantly in the Committee's consideration of its action at
this meeting as is usual. The Committee might see the heightened potential for financial
dislocation at this time as sufficient reason to keep policy on hold at this meeting, choosing
alternative B. Although financial markets have been much more liquid in recent weeks
than many participants had anticipated earlier in the year, various indicators still suggest that
trading is likely to be thin and investors unusually risk averse around year-end. Market
participants have apparently interpreted Federal Reserve actions to deal with potential
liquidity problems around the century date change, along with the adoption of a symmetric
directive at the last meeting, as virtually ensuring that the intended federal funds rate would
be left unchanged this month. With this prevailing expectation, a monetary tightening
would prompt substantial adjustments in portfolios. The extent of the resulting drop in
market prices could well be exacerbated by the thinness of markets and by the urgency that
market participants are likely to feel to complete their adjustments quickly before market
liquidity erodes further. Under the circumstances, the Committee may not want to incur
even the small risk of a potentially costly market disruption that might follow a policy
tightening, especially when any increase in inflation pressures resulting from a short delay
would be quite limited. Overall consumer price inflation is expected to moderate a little,
which should help damp inflation expectations, and most of the restraining effects of a
near-term policy firming are already built into financial market prices.
","alternative B"
2000-03-21,7,"(7) The Committee may agree that the risks to the inflation outlook are on the
upside, but still wish to stand pat on policy for the time being, as in alternative B. Such a
choice could allow it to better judge whether more near-term tightening is needed or whether
the restraining effects on aggregate demand of previous tightening actions will prove to be
sufficient to bring growth in aggregate demand into reasonable balance with that of potential
supply. Indeed, the amount of slowing required in the growth of output may not be large if
more of the extraordinary growth of productivity over the last few quarters persists than has
been allowed for in the staff forecast--the very rapid growth of activity since mid-year
produced only small declines in the unemployment rate and in the pool of available labor.
Even if the growth of aggregate demand fails to come into balance with that of potential
supply quickly enough to avoid some intensification of strains on resources, the costs of
waiting in terms of faster price increases still might be minimal if structural productivity
continues to accelerate over the next couple of years. The acceleration of structural
productivity would hold down unit labor costs and, with profits running high, competition
would continue to contain business ""pricing power."" Thus, inflation would remain damped
for some time even with a constant nominal federal funds rate, although, to be sure, a higher
real funds rate would ultimately be required to align market interest rates with improved
returns on capital investments and greater wealth-induced consumption. In effect, the
Committee would be allowing the economy to realize the gains from the extra productivity
growth mainly in temporarily higher output rather than lower inflation.
","alternative B"
2000-05-16,7,"(7) At its March meeting, the FOMC indicated that the balance of risks was
weighted toward higher inflation. During the intermeeting period, inflation pressures have
intensified, judging by the strength in incoming data on output, employment, and prices.
Accordingly, the issue addressed in this bluebook is not whether to tighten the stance of
monetary policy but by how much. Two basic alternatives are presented for consideration
by the Committee: Alternative C, under which the target federal funds rate would be raised
","Alternative C"
2000-08-22,7,"(7) Recent data on spending, productivity, and labor costs could well be seen by
the Committee as on balance supporting a decision to leave the federal funds rate target
unchanged at 6-1/2 percent, as in alternative B. Signs of an appreciable moderation in
aggregate demand growth no longer seem to be just ""tentative and preliminary,"" and unit
labor costs point toward little near-term pressure on inflation. Indeed, the growth of
aggregate demand may have already slowed enough to keep the unemployment rate from
falling, even before the effects on the economy of previous policy firmings and the flattening
in equity prices have fully played out. The conviction that aggregate demand is now growing
in line with the expansion of potential output would be strengthened if the Committee found
plausible the staff's upward revision to the rate of increase in productivity. However, even if
the current level of resource utilization holds for a time, whether that level will ultimately
prove sustainable remains an open question. In the meantime, with costs contained and
long-term inflation expectations stable or even drifting a bit lower, the Committee might
expect to incur little economic cost by awaiting more information to help answer that
","alternative B"
2000-10-03,7,"(7) While the Committee may find the pickup in core inflation in the staff forecast
to be worrisome, it may still favor keeping the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this
meeting, as under alternative B. The uptrend to core inflation in that outlook is gradual and
far from certain to come to pass. Based on incoming data, the Committee might now be
even more confident that aggregate demand growth has slowed significantly, likely to below
the growth of potential supply. Moreover, with the slippage in equity prices over the
intermeeting period, the prospects have improved that pressures on resources will not
intensify and could even begin to ebb. Higher energy prices would pose a threat to longer-
term price performance if they became embedded in inflation expectations or in wage
demands, as workers attempt to preserve purchasing power. However, oil prices have fallen
from their peaks, and, to date, longer-term inflation expectations have not shown a tendency
to move higher. Moreover, the risks stemming from oil market developments are not all in
one direction. In particular, higher oil prices could restrain aggregate demand beyond the
effects of transferring income to foreign oil producers if they induced an erosion of
consumer confidence or a substantial selloff in equities in light of the reduced economic
efficiency of the existing stock of capital. Market participants, taking into account oil prices
along with other incoming information since the last FOMC meeting, have marked down the
expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years. In these circumstances, the
Committee may see little to be lost by waiting to obtain more information on trends in
output and inflation.
","alternative B"
2000-11-15,7,"(7) Aggregate demand now has slowed more convincingly to a pace below that of
its potential, and, in the staff view, the unemployment rate seems more likely to rise than to
fall over coming quarters. If the Committee shares that assessment, it may see financial
conditions as probably already tight enough, at least for a time, to limit any further step-up in
core inflation and may select alternative B, which keeps the federal funds rate unchanged.
Indeed, if the Committee views the data on unit costs and prices of the last few years as
indicating that the sustainable rate of unemployment is below that in the staff forecast, it
might judge the present stance of policy as adequate to cap underlying inflation at the current
rate, not just to limit the rise. In addition, the Committee might be concerned that the
deterioration in financial markets witnessed over the past few months might be more likely
to continue than to be reversed, suggesting greater downside than upside risks to aggregate
demand. To be sure, oil prices, whose rise seems to explain a recent boost in near-term
inflation expectations, could remain high and pose an inflationary threat. But long-term
inflation expectations have been stable, and the staff and the futures markets expect a good
deal of the runup in energy prices to be reversed.
","alternative B"
2004-09-21,7,"(7) Table 1 presents three alternatives for near-term policy, together with
draft language for the Committees announcement.  Under Alternative A, the existing
federal funds rate target would be maintained at this meeting.  Alternative B would
raise the target 25 basis points, to 1¾ percent.  Under Alternative C, the funds rate
would similarly be raised 25 basis points, but the language of the statement would be
consistent with the possibility of more rapid firming than is currently built into
financial prices.  Under all of the alternatives, some updating of the language in the
rationale paragraph would seem appropriate.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1970-01-15,8,"(8) If the Committee decides to maintain unchanged conditions
in the money market over the next four weeks, it may wish to consider
the following second paragraph for the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF
THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING, System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing
firm conditions in the money market; provided, however,
that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears
to be deviating significantly from current projections
[DEL: or if unusual liquidity pressures should develop.]
","alternative A"
1970-02-10,8,"(8) If the Committee wishes to maintain an unchanged stance
with respect to its views as to monetary aggregates and money market
conditions, it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for
the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, while taking account of the
CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank regula-
tory change, and the Committee's desire to see a modest
growth in money and bank credit, System open market opera-
tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con-
ducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the
money market; provided, however, that operations shall be
modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating
significantly from current projections.
","alternative A"
1970-07-21,8,"(8) Only one set of interrelationships among monetary
aggregates, money market conditions, and interest rates more broadly
is discussed in the analysis that follows. This set can be considered
as consistent with either alternative A or B since, so far as the staff
can judge now, money market conditions similar to those recently pre-
vailing might be accompanied by a moderate growth in the money supply
and no strong upward pressure on interest rates. The maintenance of
money market conditions on a fairly even plane will need to condition
open market operations in any event in view of the large Treasury
financing that will be in the market during much of the inter-meeting
period. The practical difference between the two alternatives would
be in reactions of the Desk to misses in the aggregates. Under
alternative B, the Desk would be freer to react--though equally
subject to ""even-keel"" considerations as in alternative A--should the
aggregates be deviating from the indicated path, or from whatever
modification of it the Committee may wish to make.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1970-08-18,8,"(8) If the Committee wishes to continue with a policy that
encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per
cent trend rate of growth for the money supply, the following language for
the second paragraph of the directive may be considered (alternative A):
To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of persisting
market uncertainties; liquidity strains; and the forthcoming Treasury
financing;] the Committee seeks to promote moderate growth in money
and bank credit over the months ahead, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF
PERSISTING LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND allowing [DEL: for a possible] BANK
CREDIT GROWTH TO REFLECT A continued shift of credit flows from market
to banking channels. System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining
bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with that objective;
[DEL: provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to
counter excessive pressures in financial markets should they develop.]
","alternative A"
1970-09-15,8,"(8) If the Committee wishes to continue with a policy that
encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per
cent rate of growth for the money supply, the following language for the
second paragraph of the directive might be considered (alternative A):
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
[DEL:some easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat greater
MODERATE growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in the
second quarter, while taking account of possible liquidity problems
and allowing bank credit growth to reflect BANK EFFORTS TO REBUILD
LIQUIDITY AND any continued shift of credit flows from market to
banking channels. System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-
taining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with
that objective, taking account of the effects of other monetary
policy actions.]
","alternative A"
1970-12-15,8,"(8) Against the background of a 5 per cent growth rate for
money supply over the fourth quarter, the table on the following page
shows three alternative growth paths for money, bank credit, and total
reserves for the first quarter. Alternative A involves a 5 per cent
money growth rate; alternative B, 6 per cent; and alternative C, 7 per
cent. The last section of the text (paragraphs 14 through 19) discusses
possible directive language for various policy courses.
","Alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1971-06-08,8,"(8) The continued strengthening of the aggregates has led the
staff to raise its estimates of both the levels of and growth rates in
money supply and bank credit that might be expected in the near term at
any given level of interest rates. In view of recent developments the
Committee at the last meeting appears practically impossible to achieve
(except for accidental developments or substantial projection misses not
related to deliberate policy operations). Moreover, the average 8 per
cent growth rate over both the second and third quarters together--which
represented the intermediate path acceptable to the Committee last time--
would also be very difficult to attain. At the present time, such a path
would require a very sharp drop to around 4 per cent annual rate in third
quarter growth in M1 . This would appear to entail a considerable wrench-
ing of the money market, with a near-term rise in the Federal funds rate so
large as seriously to upset capital markets, possibly followed later in
the summer or early fall by the need to induce a sharp drop in the funds
rate in order to keep M1 growth from falling below even a 4 per cent rate
over the fourth quarter. Though not as magnified, similar control problems
could develop in moving onto other less restrictive paths--for instance,
the alternative C path presented for consideration at this time.
","alternative C"
1971-06-29,8,"(8) Alternative A maintains money market conditions in a range
around the average level of recent weeks; in the last few business days the
Desk has been aiming at a rate around the upper end of that range. The
alternative A money market conditions would seem most likely to be
associated with around a 10 per cent annual rate of growth in M1 over the
third quarter. Alternatives B and C provide for more scope to vary money
market conditions in an effort to reduce rates of growth in the monetary
aggregates. Because of the lagged relationship between tighter money market
conditions and money demand, however, such slower growth rates would not
be expected to develop in any significant way until later in the summer. In
the fourth quarter we would expect a further marked slowing in growth rates
of M1 as lagged reactions to earlier high interest rates continue and as
the apparently sizable precautionary demand for cash of the past few months
is worked off. Indeed, under alternative C, little or no growth in M 1 would
be expected in the fourth quarter; and alternative B, if maintained, might
provide a growth rate of only modest proportions.
","Alternative A, alternative A, alternative C, alternative B"
1971-10-19,8,"(8) An easing of money market conditions that entailed a Federal
funds rate dropping appreciably below the 5 per cent discount rate for a
sustained period could well lead to significant declines in other market
rates, particularly if expectations of an accompanying discount rate cut
should become pervasive. The lower the Federal funds rate were to drop--
and particularly if it moved into the range of alternative C--the greater
would be the possibility of a large speculative build-up in bond positions,
especially during this forthcoming Treasury financing period. Such a
build-up would carry with it the potential for a sharp subsequent market
reversal or for the need to expand money and credit rapidly to forestall
such a reversal.
","alternative C"
1971-11-16,8,"(8) Two alternative sets of specifications for Committee
consideration are summarized in the text table below. The two sets of
specifications correspond to three directive alternatives, with the
first set associated with both directive A and B and the second set
with directive C. As noted in the final section of this blue book, the
choice between directives A and B depends on the degree of emphasis the
Committee wishes to place on monetary aggregates as compared with money
market conditions.
Alternative A/B Alternative C

Member bank borrowings 150-300 50-150
Growth in M (SAAR)

December 1-1/2 3
","Alternative A, Alternative C"
1972-01-11,8,"(8) If the Committee were to adopt the language of alternative
A, it may wish to consider instructing the Manager to ease the Federal funds
rate from the prevailing 3-5/8 per cent to the neighborhood of 3-1/4 per
cent in the first week following the meeting and to the neighborhood of 3
per cent in the second week, unless a sudden surge of M1 growth were to
appear. The purpose of such an instruction would be to stimulate more
growth in M1 than has been apparent in the data thus far available. If
such an approach were successful in moving M1 onto the path specified by the
Committee as desired, the staff believes that the odds are that the funds
rate would need to be raised in the ensuing weeks in order to keep growth
in M1 around the target rate, particularly if a 6 per cent target path for
M1 is adopted but also perhaps under an 8 per cent target.
","alternative
A"
1972-05-23,8,"(8) Of the three alternatives presented, alternative A involves
money market conditions closest to those most recently prevailing. The mid-
point of the Federal funds rate range for A is around 4-1/4--4-1/2 per cent.
Under this alternative, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a
and to move above the upper end in the summer.

1972-06-19,8,"(8) The first two alternatives encompass recently prevailing
money market conditions, taken to be typified by a Federal funds rate
aroung 4-3/8--4-1/2 per cent. But under alternative A, the staff would
expect the funds rate to edge down from current levels, while under
alternative B it is likely to edge up as reserve provision through open
market operations is held back in the face of strengthening demand for money.
M1 growth is expected to be largest early in the third quarter--with the
July rise estimated at around a 9 per cent annual rate--as U. S. Government
deposits decline sharply on balance.

(9). Suggested shorter-run operating targets that are thought to be generally
consistent with the longer-run objectives are presented in paragraphs (10) to
(7) The longer-run targets under alternative A are indexed by an
M1 annual growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the fourth and first quarters.
We would expect that there may be only a modest further rise in short-term
interest rates in the fourth quarter under this alternative. In the first
quarter, with the rate of increase in nominal GNP projected to continue strong
and with large contra-seasonal Treasury cash borrowing anticipated, short-term
rates seem likely to rise more rapidly. The timing of interest rate movements
cannot, of course, be predicted with any certainty. It is always possible,
for example, that sizable foreign central bank transactions may affect the bill
market. Also, interest rates could rise substantially late this year as the
market anticipated heavy Treasury first quarter credit demands. On balance, one
might anticipate a 3-month Treasury bill rate rising to a 5-1/2--5-3/4 per cent
area by the end of the first quarter.
","alternative A"
1972-11-20,8,"(8) The alternatives shown are similar to those presented in the
previous blue book. However, the relationships suggest a somewhat lower level
of interest rates for any given expansion of the aggregates. We would expect

that the alternative B aggregate objectives could be attained with little
change in money market conditions, while the objectives of alternative A would
entail easing and those of C tightening.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1973-03-19,8,"(8) Assuming adoption of the somewhat larger growth rates for
the aggregates as a longer-run target under alternative A, money market
conditions would be likely to ease down through the range shown for that
option over the next few weeks. On the other hand, an effort to secure a
slowing in rates of growth in the monetary aggregates of the dimensions
shown under alternative C would be likely to entail a further rise in the
Federal funds rate from current levels. The pattern for this alternative
shown in the detailed table on p. 6a assumes that the funds rate would
rise to near the upper end of the 7--8-1/4 per cent range before the next
Committee meeting. If the Committee wished to undertake a more gradual
tightening--for example, constraining the rise in the funds rate to
around 8 per cent over a two-month period--the staff would still expect a
significant slowing in growth of the aggregates over time. The slowing,
however, would probably be somewhat delayed with M 1 expected to expand
at a 5 per cent annual rate in the second quarter and 4 per cent in the

1973-04-17,8,"(8) The staff expects that the alternative B path for the
aggregates would be achieved with little change from recently prevailing
money market conditions. Given such conditions--centering on a Federal
funds rate of 7 per cent--growth in M1 is expected to be somewhat
greater than it has been on balance over the first three months of the
year. In April-May, a growth rate of 4--6 per cent for M1 is indicated.
During that period, income tax refunds are likely to add somewhat to
private demand balances. In addition, continued strong expansion in
economic activity will likely lead to a reassertion of the underlying
growth trend in transactions demands for cash. On the basis of historical
experience, the sharp drop in demand for money relative to GNP growth
that developed in the first quarter seems very unlikely to persist.
","alternative B"
1973-05-15,8,"(8) Alternative B is consistent with the long run path for the
aggregates (as indexed by M1 growth of 5--5-1/2 per cent) adopted by the
Committee at recent meetings. Attainment of these longer-run objectives
might well involve some further tightening of the money market, with

the funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting probably moving
up toward the top of the 7-1/4--8 per cent range shown. This represents
somewhat tighter money market conditions than were specified at the time
of the last meeting as consistent with the given longer-run objectives for
the aggregates. This specification of tighter money market conditions re-
flects the greater strength of money supply in recent weeks and the sizable
upward revision in the projection of nominal GNP for the second quarter.
","Alternative B"
1973-07-17,8,"(8) In the weeks immediately ahead, the staff expects that
there would be little further change in the Federal funds rate if the
Committee adopts the aggregate targets specified in alternative B. The
funds rate range shown for this alternative centers on the recently
prevailing 9-3/4 per cent level. Under alternative A, we would expect
the funds rate to decline from current levels as more reserves are
provided to encourage monetary growth, and under alternative C we would
expect it to rise.
","alternative B, alternative c, alternative A, alternative C"
1973-09-18,8,"(8) The assumption of unchanged money market conditions is
incorporated in the specifications presented here as alternative C. This
alternative includes a growth rate for M1 over the fourth and first quarters
combined of about 3 per cent. The levels of M1 that would be reached in the
final months of each of these quarters under this alternative are shown on
the chart by the dots labelled ""C"". As will be noted from the chart, the
shortfall from path would be expected to widen further in the first quarter.

","alternative B"
1973-12-17,8,"(9) If the Committee wishes to maintain money market conditions
close to those currently prevailing, the staff would expect growth in the
aggregates to slow to alternative C dimensions. With the Federal funds
rate unchanged, it is likely that market interest rates--particularly
short-term rates--would adjust upward from current levels in the process
of re-establishing a more normal relationship to the funds rate. Current
levels of market rates are low relative to the funds rate--in part,
apparently, because market participants are anticipating an economic
slowdown and the money market easing that has accompanied slowdowns
in the past.
","alternative C"
1974-01-21,8,"(10) No matter which of these alternatives might be chosen,
the rates of growth for M1 are expected to be higher in the second quarter
than in the first quarter of 1974, and to be quite moderate for the two
month January-February period. For example, under alternative B, the
annual rate of M1 growth over the first quarter is indicated to be around
but to rise to 7 per cent in the second quarter. The greater growth in
the second quarter reflects the temporary impact of large tax refunds--
estimated at $2-$3 billion above last year--and initial consumer adjustments
to higher social security benefit payments. We would expect M1 growth in
the third quarter, assuming little change in interest rates from those
prevailing, to be on the order of one percentage point lower than in the
second quarter as these temporary factors disappear.
","alternative B"
1974-06-18,8,"(8) At its last meeting the Committee adopted longer-run
targets for the second and third quarters combined that included a
of such a growth rate to year-end is illustrated by the dashed line
in the chart on the following page. Rates of growth consistent with
that extended path are shown in alternative C. These include a 4¾
per cent annual rate of growth in M1 between June and year-end, which
would compensate for the estimated 7 per cent annual rate of growth
for Ml in the second quarter and would lead to an average 5½ per
cent growth for the last three quarters of the year.

1974-09-10,8,"(8) Alternative C involves a 5¼ per cent growth rate for
M1 over the target period and assumes money market conditions about
unchanged from those recently prevailing. Because of the shortfalls
in M1 in July and August, such a growth rate measured from August would
imply lower levels of M1 in coming months than were implicit in the
longer-run target (of 5¼ per cent for the second half of 1974) that
was adopted at the August Committee meeting. Alternative B con-
templates a 5¾ per cent growth rate for M1 from now on. Such a growth
rate would compensate for recent shortfalls by early spring of next
year--i.e., by early spring of 1975, the rate of increase in M1
measured from mid-1974 would be around 5¼ per cent. The more rapid
almost make up for the recent shortfall by year-end.
","Alternative C, Alternative B"
1974-10-14,8,"(8) Based on partial data for the early days of the month, M1
growth in October is expected to be quite slow. Growth is,expected to pick up
considerably later in the fall and early winter, partly in consequence of
the lagged impact on money demand of recent and projected interest rate
declines. Over the October-November period, M1 growth is indicated to
be in a 4¾-6¾ per cent annual rate range under alternative B. Given the
small rise in September, the 5¾ per cent growth rate from August to March
implies a 6½ per cent rate from September to March--i.e. over the fourth
and first quarters.
","alternative B"
1974-11-19,8,"(8) Alternative B continues the 5¾ per cent annual growth rate
for M1 previously adopted by the Committee. The Federal funds rate range
shown for this alternative between now and the next meeting is centered
on 9¼ per cent, and thus represents a slight further easing in money
market conditions. This easing appears to be required because the
rebound in M1 growth this fall has thus far been somewhat more modest
than expected; moreover, projected growth in nominal GNP has been
weakened slightly. In the two-month November-December period, M1 growth

is indicated to be in a 7-9 per cent annual rate range under this
alternative, reflecting the cumulative impact of the monetary easing
that has already occurred and an expected sharp, temporary spurt in M1
growth late in the year when U.S. Government deposits are projected to
decline substantially (after seasonal adjustment).

1975-01-20,8,"(8) Alternative A encompasses the 6 per cent longer-run annual
rate of growth for M1 (over the seven-month November '74-June '75 period)
that was preferred by the Committee at its last meeting, the achievement
of which would now require a 6¾ per cent growth rate over the first half
of this year. Under this alternative the funds rate would be expected to
decline to 6 per cent, or a shade below, between now and mid-February.
Growth in M1 by February would be expected to be considerably higher than
in recent months, partly in lagged reaction to earlier interest rate
declines, and partly because the behavior of money appears to have been
unusually weak recently relative to nominal GNP. Given the very low growth
that seems in store for January, however, the M1 growth rate would be
expected to be in a 4-6 per cent range for the two-month January-February
","Alternative A"
1975-06-16,8,"(8) The longer-run path for M1 in alternative B does imply
a somewhat more rapid rate of growth from March '75 to March '76 than
contemplated by the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent range adopted by the
Committee at its previous meetings. This is because M1 growth in the
second quarter seems likely to be at about a 9 per cent annual rate,
as compared with the around 7 per cent rate earlier contemplated. The
growth rate from March '75 to March '76 implicit in the currently pro-
posed alternative B is around 7 per cent (based on mid-points). This is,
of course, within the adopted range, though toward the upper end.

1975-07-15,8,"(8) The short-run specifications of alternative B involve
maintenance of prevailing money market conditions between now and the
next Committee meeting. Thus, the Federal funds rate range shown is

the two-month July-August period will slow considerably from the recent
extreme pace. M1 is likely to expand in a 3½-5½ per cent annual rate

late June and early July indicate an unwinding of the recent deposit
expansion and support the view that the upsurge in good part reflected
temporary factors (tax rebates and one-time payments to social security
recipients). For July, M1 growth is expected to be slightly negative,
while growth in August is expected to resume at a pace more consonant

of the 6-1/4 per cent mid-point of the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per cent

more rapid growth in nominal GNP proves correct, we believe that
efforts to hold M1 expansion to the 6-1/4 per cent long-run target
will require further substantial increases in the Federal funds rate
during the fall and early winter--perhaps to 10 per cent or more
by early 1976.

alternative growth over the two-month November-December period is
estimated to be in a 6½-8½ per cent annual rate range. The main basis
for this expectation is the growing need for transactions balances

result in expansion from QIII '75 to QIV '75 at a rate of about 2¾ per cent,
implying a rise in income velocity at about an 11 per cent annual rate between
those quarters. This would be an extremely large rise even for the early
stages of an economic recovery, particularly if, as assumed, it is not
associated with upward interest rate pressures during the quarter.
(8) Such a large rise in velocity would not appear to be long
sustainable at current interest rate levels, given the reduction in the
public's cash balances relative to income that has already occurred and
given the continued, even though somewhat diminished, rate of expansion
projected for nominal GNP in 1976. With the demand for money likely to
continue to rise, the staff would expect the Federal funds rate to increase
in the course of next year if the rate of growth in M1 is to average near
the mid-point of the FOMC's longer-run target range of 5-7 per cent. By
summer, the funds rate might peak out at around 7½ ½er cent. This would be
lower than had been projected by the staff at the time of the last meeting.

1976-04-20,8,"(8) The Federal funds rate range of alternative B is centered
on the recently prevailing 4¾ per cent level. Given the bulge in M1 in
early April, we expect that such a funds rate would be accompanied by M1
growth in a 5-9 per cent, annual rate, range over the April-May period.
With expansion in time and savings deposits other than large CD's remaining

of the Committee remains around the recently prevailing 5½ per cent--the
mid-point of the alternative B range--the staff would expect that the annual
rate of M1 growth may be in a 4-8 per cent range over the June-July period.
In light of the data already reported for the early part of the month,
growth in June is expected to be around a 5 per cent annual rate. Such a
growth rate may reflect, in part, continued adjustment by cash-holders to
the April bulge in M1 growth. Recently available deposit ownership survey
figures suggest that much of the April increase was in balances of consumers,
who may take a longer time than busineses and other holders to restore their
balances to desired levels. The staff expects M1 growth in July to be at
a somewhat higher rate, in view of the projected rise in nominal GNP.

over the next few weeks--with the funds rate moving down to the mid-point
of a 4-5 per cent range. However, assuming the staff's projection of the
rate of expansion in nominal GNP over the next year is correct, interest rates
would not be expected to decline for long and would probably soon have to
begin rising if M1 growth over the QIII '76-QIII '77 period were to be kept
to around 5½ per cent (the mid-point of the Committee's longer-run range of
easier and monetary growth rates somewhat more rapid over the next six

to their reduced January pace, as banks remain less aggressive in
offering time deposits over the next few weeks in light of moderate
bank credit demands from business and other customers. Also, the rise
in yield on intermediate-term Treasury obligations since the beginning
of the year has made such securities somewhat more attractive to savers
as compared with time certificates of deposit.
","alternative B"
1977-06-21,8,"(8) Under alternative B growth in M-2 over June-July would
be expected to pick up somewhat, due mainly to the anticipated
strengthening in M-1. However, growth in the time and savings deposit
component of M-2 also should recover somewhat from the reduced pace of
recent months. The stimulative effects on time and savings deposit
inflows of a continued rise in personal income and advances in offering
rates at some banks are expected to be about counterbalanced by the
delayed impact of earlier increases in short-term market rates.
","alternative B"
1977-10-17,8,"(8) It may be seen that under alternative D growth in M-1 at
around a 4¼ per cent rate over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period would lead to
expansion in the QII '77-QIII '78 period at a 5¼ per cent annual rate
--the mid-point of the current longer-run range. Growth would be somewhat
higher if measured from QI '77 since there was also an overshoot in the
second quarter for which alternative D does not compensate. Growth of
M-1 of around 5¼ per cent in the QIII '77-QIII '78 period, as called
for under alternative B, would be associated with expansion over the
in the upper part of the FOMC's current longer-run range. Under all of
the alternatives, however, growth rates in M-2 over the more extended
the lower half, of its current 7-9½ per cent range.
","alternative B"
1977-11-15,8,"(8) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be
expected to remain near the mid-point of the 6¼ to 6¾ per cent rate range
specified by the Committee at its last meeting. M-1 growth over the
November-December period likely to be associated with such a funds rate
would be in a 2-7 per cent annual rate range. While data available so
far this month suggest that M-1 will expand only slightly in November,
the staff would anticipate an acceleration in December--perhaps to about
an 8 per cent annual rate--given the projected strengthening of nominal
GNP and the associated underlying transactions demands for cash. Such an
expansion would produce a 7½ per cent annual rate of growth of M-1 from the
third to the fourth quarter, somewhat below the 9 per cent average annual
rate of growth of this aggregate in the second and third quarters of 1977.

1978-01-17,8,"(8) The table below provides perspective on the relationship
between growth rates proposed for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period and for 5-
and 18-month periods also ending in QIV '78. It shows, for instance,
that growth in M-1 at around the 5-1/4 per cent mid-point of the pro-
posed alternative B range would lead to a 5.6 per cent annual rate of
expansion over the 15-month period starting with QIII '77 and to a 6.3
per cent annual rate of growth over the 18-month period beginning with
QII '77--in both cases within the current FOMC range, but above the mid-
point. This is the case because of the sizable overshoot in M-1 growth in
the third quarter of last year and the slight overshoot in the fourth.
M-1 growth at the mid-point of the proposed 4-6 per cent alternative C
range would virtually compensate for the slight fourth quarter overshoot,
since this would lead to a 5.4 per annual rate of expansion over the

1978-02-28,8,"(9) Each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment
in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis
points on small-denomination time deposits; the adjustments in ceiling
rates are assumed to occur in April under alternative C, in May under
B, and in June under A. Without such adjustments, the increase in
market rates thought necessary to restrain M-1 growth to the mid-point
of the indicated ranges would lead to growth in M-2 and M-3 near
the lower ends of the ranges shown.1/
","alternative C"
1978-04-18,8,"(8) The demand for M-1 is expected to be quite strong over
the one-year period from QI '78 to QI '7 9 , when nominal GNP is projected
to rise at a rate of almost 12 per cent, about one percentage
point more than had been projected a month ago. A little more than half
of the increase in the rate of expansion in nominal GNP for the QI '78-
QI '79 period reflects an upward revision in the projected rate of
inflation over the year. The balance reflects the weather- and coal-
strike induced reduction in the rate of growth of real GNP in QI '78--
projected to be largely made up in QII '78--which lowers the base
quarter for the new four-quarter policy period. To hold M-1 growth
over the coming year to a rate around the mid-point of the 4 to 6
per cent range of alternative B would, under the circumstances, require
a larger increase in interest rates than the staff had earlier
expected. As indicated in Appendix I, we would anticipate a Federal
funds rate averaging around 8¾ per cent by early next year if the mid-
points of the longer-run ranges of alternative B are to be attained.
Interest rates would be slightly lower and slightly higher under
alternatives A and C, respectively.

Federal funds rate around its recently prevailing level of 7½ per cent
and is expected to be associated with M-1 growth in a 7 to 11 per cent
annual rate range over the forthcoming two-month period. The staff
projection implies that growth in M-1 over the second quarter will
be at a 9½ per cent annual rate, and that in July this aggregate

","Alternative A"
1978-07-18,8,"(8) The demand for M-1 is expected to remain quite strong
over the new QII '78 to QII '79 policy period, when nominal GNP is
projected to rise about 11 per cent. Thus, over the next several
months a further substantial rise in short-term rates appears needed
to restrain M-1 growth even to the high end of the ranges shown.
As indicated in Appendix I, the staff anticipates that the Federal
funds rate would have to rise to the 8¾ to 9¾ per cent range by
fall under alternative B. Interest rates in the fourth quarter would
be about one percentage point lower under alternative A and three-
quarters of a percentage point higher under alternative C.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1978-08-15,8,"(8) Alternative A contemplates continuation of a Federal
funds rate around the mid-point of the existing 7¾ to 8 per cent range.
Under the circumstances, M-1 growth over the August-September period
is expected to accelerate into a 5½ to 9½ per cent, annual rate,
range--bringing the level of M-1 by September a shade above that
implied by the upper bound of the Committee's newly adopted longer-
run range, as may be seen from chart 1 on the following page.
M-1 growth in June and July may have been held down by an unusually
rapid run-up in U.S. Government deposits, and such deposits are
projected to decline in September. Moreover, transactions demands
for cash are likely to be fairly strong in the third quarter as a
whole, when nominal GNP is projected to rise at about an 11 per cent
annual rate. The projected M-1 increase for August and September would
lead to an expansion in the third quarter at about a 6¼ per cent
annual rate, and would imply a rise in velocity of 4¼ per cent at an
annual rate (see Appendix II).

1980-03-18,8,"(8) Alternative B extends through June the FOMC's previous
target rates of growth of M-1A and M-1B for the December to March period
of 4 and 5 percent annual rates, respectively. Such growth, as shown on
chart 1 on the next page, would also achieve levels of M-1A and M-1B
by June that are on the midpoint paths of the Committee's longer-run
QIV '79 to QIV '80 target ranges for these aggregates. Of course, given
the surge in growth in the aggregates in February, M-1A and M-1B growth would
have to slow considerably in the February-June period--to 3 and 3¾ percent
average annual rates, respectively. With a significant weakening in these
aggregates recently, and with nominal GNP growth projected by the staff
to decelerate in the spring quarter, such average rates of growth might be
consistent with a federal funds rate over the next few weeks not far from
the 16 to 17 percent level that has prevailed recently.1/ Restraints on
use of credit cards and check overdraft facilities in the new anti-inflation
program could tend to increase the demand for money (or more particularly
currency), but probably by no more than a minor amount, if at all, since
a certain amount of spending might be curtailed and some spenders may simply
write more checks on existing demand deposit holdings.
","Alternative B"
1980-10-21,8,"(8) Shown below for Committee consideration are alternative
sets of monetary aggregate targets for the fourth quarter. Alternative A
retains the Committee's September target of a 4 percent annual growth rate
for M-1A over the last four months of the year. Given September growth,
this implies M-1A expansion from September to December at an annual rate
of 1¼ percent, as shown in the upper panel of the table. Alternative B
is designed to achieve the 4¾ percent midpoint of the Committee's QIV '79
to QIV '80 range for M-1A, which implies growth over the last three months
of 1980 of this aggregate at an annual rate more than 2 percentage points
faster than under alternative A. The lower panel of the table shows growth
for the two alternatives on a quarterly average basis. Associated federal
funds rate ranges for the intermeeting period are also shown. (Detailed

1981-05-18,8,"(8) Alternative C is based on continuation of the 5 percent
annual rate of growth for M-1B over the March to June period targeted by
the Committee at its last meeting--a growth rate which, as shown in
chart 1, would result in a June level about at the lower end of the
Committee's longer-run range. To achieve this short-run target would
require growth of narrow money at a 1¼ percent annual rate on average in
May and June, with June probably needing to show a contraction in the
outstanding level of money.

require an 8½ percent annual rate of growth over the two-month July-to-
September period. However, in view of the greater than expected strength
of the nontransactions component of M2, it seems likely that attaining the
M1 target for the third quarter will result in M2 expansion in excess of
the growth rate of 9 percent or less desired by the Committee at its last
meeting. We would now expect growth in M2 from June to September under

detailed and longer-run data for the alternatives are contained in the
table and charts on the following pages, and the quarterly interest rate
pattern underlying the staff's GNP projection for 1982 is contained in
appendix II.) Alternative A, calling for a 4½ percent rate of growth of
M1 in the March-to-June interval, would, as shown in Chart 1, maintain
the level of narrow money above the upper end of the Committee's 2½-to-5½
percent longer-run range throughout the second quarter; however, that
rate, if sustained over the second half, would bring M1 down to the upper
end of range by year-end. The 3 percent M1 rate of growth from March to
June of alternative B is designed to bring the level of that aggregate to
about the upper limit of the Committee's longer-run range by around mid-year.
The alternative C specification of 1½ percent M1 growth would place that
aggregate at about the middle of the upper half of the range by mid-year.

1982-06-30,8,"(8) Whether the Committee retains its current longer-run ranges,
or raises them modestly as in alternative B, a marked slowing in growth of
M1 would be required from the first-half pace of a little over 7 percent at
an annual rate (as measured from QIV '81 to QII '82). If the Committee were
to aim at 5 percent growth for the year, expansion in the second half would
have to slow to around a 2¾ percent annual rate. Second-half growth could

a substantial rebound in growth during May and June, partly as seasonal

demands for cash balances over the quarter as a whole from growth of
income and spending. M2 appears to be in process of expanding in
somewhat closer alignment to growth of income, following the unusual
increases in velocity in the second half of the last year and in the
first quarter. M2 velocity would still be expected to increase during
the second quarter, but at about a 2 percent annual rate, a slower pace
than it averaged over the previous three quarters. On the other hand,
M1 velocity would be expected again to increase relatively rapidly-at
around a 3-3/4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, given the
staff's GNP projection. This outlook for velocity of M1 and M2 assumes
that there is no significant increase in precautionary demands for

be somewhat less than earlier anticipated given the somewhat slower growth
in nominal GNP now projected for the third quarter. While M1 growth from

this alternative, it would grow about 5-1/2 percent on a quarterly average
basis. M1 velocity would increase at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, considerably below the rate of increase in the first half
of the year, but still probably slightly above the underlying trend at
unchanged interest rates. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, demand
for M1 might be expected to pick up and velocity growth to moderate a bit
further as the restraining effects of previous interest rate increases on
money demand diminish. With interest rates remaining roughly around
current levels into the fourth quarter, as assumed in the staff GNP
forecast, M1 growth for QIV 1983 to QIV 1984 might be around 6-1/2 percent.
","alternative B"
1984-10-02,8,"(9) All the alternatives specify more rapid M1 growth over
the next three months relative to its sluggish behavior over the June-to-
September period. Transactions demands are expected to strengthen in
association with the projected pickup in nominal GNP growth in the
fourth quarter, while the dampening effects on money demand of earlier
increases in short-term interest rates should diminish over the quarter
and begin to be reversed by the recent moderate declines in short rates.
On a quarterly average basis, M1 in the fourth quarter would increase at
a 5-3/4 percent annual rate under alternative B, implying an increase in
velocity of around 2-3/4 percent, given the staff's GNP forecast.

out of cash into longer-term market instruments as expectations of
declining rates became more widespread--are expected to abate. Moreover,
demand for this aggregate will be boosted over coming months by increases
in nominal income and spending and by the usual lagged effects of the
sizable declines in short-term interest rates since early September. The
expected pickup in M1 growth in November and December would yield only
about a 2-1/2 percent annual growth rate over the last three months of the
year and only 1-1/2 percent on a quarterly average basis. For the year
as a whole (QIV to QIV), M1 growth would be around 5 percent.

projected expansion in nominal GNP, reflecting some remaining lagged
effects on money demand of earlier interest rate declines. The pattern of
M1 growth over the quarter could be affected by the timing of tax refunds.
The amount of such refunds to date has lagged considerably behind disburse-
ments in comparable periods during the past two years. Refunds are
expected to run 10 percent less in total this year, but payments thus far
have been well below that pace. That may have been a marginal factor
restraining M1 growth in recent weeks, and as the Treasury catches up
could boost growth a bit.

1985-08-20,8,"(8) Alternative B, which assumes reserve pressures indexed by
borrowing in a $350 to $450 million range, encompasses growth in M1 from
June to September at a 9 percent annual rate. Nonborrowed and total
reserves would be expected to expand at about 8 and 5 percent annual
rates, respectively, over the last two months of the quarter. Federal

borrowing to a range of $200 to $250 million and an associated drop in the
federal funds rate to near the current 7-1/2 percent discount rate. A
slight firming of money market conditions is assumed under alternative C,
involving an increase in discount window borrowing to around $550 to $600
million, with federal funds likely to trade in the neighborhood of 8-1/8

the current degree of pressure on bank reserve positions as indexed by $300

annual rate from March to June. This would leave it a little above the
upper end of its 3 to 8 percent longer-run range in June. M2 growth at 7
percent over the three months would lift this aggregate to around the lower

1986-05-20,8,"(8) Under alternative B discount window borrowing would continue
around $300 million, with the federal funds rate remaining generally between
considerably in June, though still increasing at a 13 percent rate over the
March-to-June period. The effects of earlier market rate declines on
demands for transactions balances should be abating in June, and incentives
to shift into NOWs should diminish as their offering rates decrease further
in lagged response to the previous drop in market rates. Moreover, growth
in demand deposits could moderate in coming weeks following their recent
bulge. Even with its slowing in June, on a quarterly average basis M1
would grow at a 13-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, implying
an extraordinary 9 percent decline in velocity, assuming the staff's GNP
forecast. Over the last two quarters of the year, M1 growth would have to
slow to a 5 percent annual rate to hit the upper end of its annual range.
This could entail some rise in interest rates over the second half,
especially if economic activity strengthens as expected.
","alternative B"
1986-08-19,8,"(8) Growth in all the monetary aggregates is expected to slow
over August and September from the very rapid pace of July. Even so, with
reserve conditions about unchanged as assumed for alternative B, growth of
the broader aggregates would be expected to come in around the upper end
or a bit above the Committee's 7 to 9 percent range for June to September.
Growth within that range would seem to require a moderate increase in pres-
sures on reserve positions, as embodied in alternative C. Should pressures
be eased as under alternative A, M2 in particular would be expected to be
more noticeably above the short-run range, though likely remaining just
within its long-run range through September. M1 growth would be anticipated
to remain quite rapid under any of the alternatives, though below the extra-
ordinary pace of the second quarter.

1986-09-23,8,"(8) Under Alternative B, which assumes continuation of the cur-
rent degree of pressure on reserve positions, growth in M2 and M3 expected
over the next four months would leave these aggregates at the 9 percent
upper ends of their annual ranges. With the moderate easing or tightening
of reserve pressures assumed for alternatives A and C, respectively, the
broader aggregates would be expected to move above or below the upper bounds
of their annual ranges, with the gap widening as the year comes to a close.
However, even under these alternatives, given the lateness in the year,

rates are expected to vary around current levels; consistent with the staff
forecast, incoming indicators of domestic output growth and inflation
should not provide the basis for a major shift in sentiment. However, mar-
kets are likely to remain sensitive to developments in oil markets--especi-
ally given the current OPEC meeting--and in foreign exchange markets. Down-
ward pressures on the dollar could re-emerge in light of continued large
current account deficits, especially absent evidence of a greater willing-

aggregates under all three alternatives is expected to pick up from the

partly reflected market perceptions that the System is, or soon would be,
seeking firmer reserve conditions than those assumed in this alternative.
Under normal circumstances, attainment of the alternative B borrowing path
and its broad perception as the System's operating objective might be as-
sociated with the federal funds rate dropping to appreciably below 6-1/2
percent. However, continuation of concerns about the dollar and infla-
tion and related uncertainties about the stance of monetary policy might
prevent the funds rate from falling below the 6-1/2 percent area. If the
funds rate were to settle around 6-1/2 percent, Treasury bills probably would
trade in a 5-3/4 to 6 percent range. The lower level of the funds rate could
encourage a decline in rates on other private short-term instruments.

","alternative B"
1988-12-13,8,"(8) Two policy alternatives are presented below for Committee
consideration. The relation between federal funds rates and borrowing
under both alternatives is unusually uncertain, in light of the recent
shortfalls in borrowing relative to the spread of the funds rate over the
discount rate. The possibility of year-end pressures in the funds market
and the scope for changing expectations of near-term policy actions add
to this uncertainty over coming weeks. Under Alternative B, a borrowing
objective of $400 million would be retained, and federal funds would be
expected to settle mainly into an 8-3/8 to 8-1/2 percent range, though
slightly higher rates are possible through year-end. Alternative C incor-
porates an increase in intended discount borrowing to $600 million, with
the federal funds rate likely to move up to around 8-7/8 to 9 percent.
Similar conditions in the funds market also could be engendered through a
at $400 million. These relations assume that most, though perhaps not
all, of the recent shortfall in borrowing will persist; smaller banks may
well remain less willing to tap the discount window, but large bank
borrowing, while subject to the usual vicissitudes of computer problems,
could return toward normal once the year-end, with its anticipated money
market pressures, is past.
","Alternative B, Alternative C"
1989-03-28,8,"(8) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee consider-
ation. Alternative B maintains the current degree of reserve market pres-
sure, with federal funds trading around 9-3/4 percent or slightly higher
in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $500 million.
Alternative A entails federal funds around 9-1/4 percent and borrowing of
$300 million, and alternative C involves funds around 10-1/4 percent and
borrowing of $700 million. These relationships assume that the heightened
reluctance of banks to tap the discount window of recent weeks will per-
sist over the intermeeting period. Uncertainties about the relationship
between borrowing and the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate
suggest a continued flexible approach to the borrowing objective in open
market operations. Even with this approach, funds could temporarily trade
above expected levels in coming days should significant quarter-end
pressures emerge and again in the latter half of April should individual
income tax payments prove to be larger than anticipated, leading to a
sharper advance in required reserves and a larger drain in bank reserves.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, alternative C"
1989-08-22,8,"(8) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee con-
sideration. Alternative B involves federal funds continuing to trade
mostly in a 9 to 9-1/8 percent range and adjustment plus seasonal borrow-
ing at the discount window remaining at $550 million. Under alternative
A, a funds rate of 8-1/2 to 8-5/8 percent would be expected to be asso-
ciated with borrowing of $450 million, while under alternative C, a funds
rate of 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 percent would accompany borrowing of $650 million.
As is apparent, the alternatives incorporate a rule of thumb of 50 basis
points on the funds rate for each $100 million change in adjustment plus
seasonal borrowing, implying discount borrowing behavior that is only half
as responsive as that embodied in the traditional rule of thumb. This
reduced sensitivity stems in part from the very low and largely frictional
levels of adjustment borrowing that would be consistent with any of these
funds rates. Consequently, the bulk of borrowing is likely to remain
seasonal credit. Under alternative A, seasonal credit would have to drop
significantly from current levels. Such credit is sensitive to the spread
between the funds rate and the discount rate, though less so than adjust-
ment credit has been historically. Abstracting from interest-spread
effects, seasonal borrowing, which reached record levels in late July, is
likely to begin to move lower later in the intermeeting period. But with
seasonal credit showing surprising strength and adjustment credit inex-
plicably weak, the outlook for borrowing remains uncertain, suggesting
continued flexibility by the Desk in its approach to the borrowing objec-
","Alternative B, alternative
A, alternative C, alternative A"
1989-10-03,8,"(8) Three alternatives are presented below. Under alternative B,
a federal funds rate of around 9 percent would be expected to be asso-
ciated, at least initially, with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
$500 million. This level of borrowing is $50 million less than the cur-
rent assumption, in order to take into account the decline in seasonal
borrowing that is likely to occur early in the intermeeting period. Based
on the experience of last year, seasonal borrowing should not only drop
significantly in the next maintenance period but also fall substantially
further over the balance of the intermeeting period, suggesting that
another downward technical adjustment might be called for before the next
meeting. Such adjustments are needed this year because seasonal borrowing
has reached record levels and its seasonal decline will be exceptionally
large. Moreover, with adjustment borrowing close to frictional levels, it
probably is relatively insensitive to movements in the spread between the
federal funds and discount rates. Thus, in current circumstances the
funds rate would tend to rise appreciably in the absence of technical
adjustments to the borrowing assumption because the interest sensitivity
of seasonal and adjustment borrowing combined is quite low. This also
implies that, under alternative A, a decline of only $100 million in the
borrowing objective--to $400 million--is likely to be associated with a
decrease in the federal funds rate to around 8-1/2 percent; similarly, a
rise of only $100 million in borrowing--to $600 million--would be asso-
ciated with an increase in the federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent
under alternative C. In any event, owing to the continued uncertainty
about the borrowing relationship, some flexibility in pursuit of the bor-
rowing objective would again seem to be warranted.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1989-11-14,8,"(8) Two alternatives are presented below for Committee considera-
tion. In alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around
seasonal borrowing of $200 million. In alternative A, a federal funds
rate around 8 percent would be accompanied by a borrowing assumption of
$100 million. The $100 million difference between the alternatives'
borrowing assumptions still seems appropriate in light of the reduced
sensitivity of borrowing as it nears frictional levels. Both borrowing
levels embody a downward technical adjustment of $50 million from the
current $250 million allowance in recognition of recent and anticipated
further seasonal declines in seasonal borrowing. Continuing uncertainty
about borrowing behavior, however, still appears to justify flexibility in
the Desk's approach to the borrowing objective.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1990-05-15,8,"(8) Projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from
March to June are given in the table below for all three alternatives.
(The table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.)
Under alternative B, growth in both M2 and M3 would pick up over May and
June from the sluggish pace of April. This pickup results in part from a
cessation of the runoff of demand deposits and RPs. In addition, the
response of depositors to previous increases in opportunity costs would
begin to wane. Moreover, opportunity costs have already narrowed from
April and, with market interest rates stable, this narrowing could con-
tinue, buoying retail deposit inflows, as banks raise small time deposit
rates, albeit slowly, in adjustment to increases in market rates on bal-
ance this year. To an extent, the strengthening of M2 and M3 under this
alternative rests on a rebound in bank credit growth and associated fund-
ing needs in May and June--given the evidence that reductions in willing-
ness to lend are limited. Again, the behavior of the RTC constitutes a
major uncertainty in the outlook for money growth. To date in the second
quarter, RTC spending still has been fairly modest. We have assumed pro-
gressively more resolution activity over May and June, but well below
RTC's announced goal of 141 resolutions involving $50 billion of assets
for this quarter. A surge in RTC activity could damp M3 growth as thrift
assets end up on the government's balance sheet. And it could affect M2
as well, if large volumes of retail deposits are transferred to commercial
banks without accompanying loans and investments, reducing bank needs to
raise deposit offering rates. On balance, M2 growth is projected to
strengthen to a 5 percent pace on average in May and June, in line with
average growth over the first four months of the year. M3 growth would
remain quite sluggish as thrifts continued to shrink--through RTC resolu-
tions and through action to meet capital requirements--but would pick up a
little to about a 3-1/2 percent pace from growth of around 1 percent in
March and April.

1990-11-13,8,"(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee
consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue trading
around 7-3/4 percent. Under alternative A, the funds rate would move down
to the 7-1/4 percent area, while under alternative C it would firm slight-
ly, returning to around the 8 percent level prevailing at the last meet-
ing. The associated level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing under
alternative B would be set at $250 million in the first maintenance period
after the meeting and might need to be lowered another $50 million over
the intermeeting period to accommodate the ongoing decline in the demand
for seasonal credit. Under alternative A, the initial level of borrowing
would be lowered to $200 million (or the discount rate could be cut by 1/2
percentage point), while under alternative C it would be raised to $275
million. The relationship of reserve availability and the federal funds
rate is likely to remain highly uncertain and volatile as banks manage
reserves to avoid being seen at the discount window or being forced to tap
potentially unreceptive funding sources.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C, alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1991-03-26,8,"(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee
consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade
around 6 percent and would be associated with adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing initially of $125 million. An increase to about $250 million
over the intermeeting period may be called for as seasonal borrowing
continues its normal climb. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate
would fall to 5-1/2 percent, effected either through a reduction in
borrowing to $75 million or a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate and
the same borrowing specification as in alternative B. As noted in recent
bluebooks, it is technically feasible for federal funds to trade below the
discount rate. However, the discount window becomes a marginally less
effective buffer to unpredictable changes in reserve supply or demand, and
the federal funds rate likely would be a little more volatile than if
alternative A were achieved through a discount rate cut. Moreover, allow-
ing the funds rate to fall below the discount rate is likely to give rise
to market uncertainty about System intentions; in particular, there would
be more speculation about whether a discount rate cut is forthcoming or
whether a penalty discount rate is being instituted. Under alternative C,
the federal funds rate would rise to 6-1/2 percent and the initial borrow-
ing level would be increased to $175 million.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1991-05-14,8,"(8) Two policy alternatives for Committee consideration are
discussed below. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would remain
in the 5-3/4 percent area, in association with an initial specification
for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $225 million--an increase of $25
million from the current level to take account of the likely rise of sea-
sonal borrowing. Under alternative A, federal funds would trade around
initial borrowing specification to $175 million together with the current
combined with the $225 million initial borrowing specification. 5 Drop-
ping the funds rate below the discount rate and operating at frictional
levels of borrowing could have the minor disadvantage of further circum-
scribing the role of the discount window in cushioning unexpected shifts
in reserve supply and demand, thereby adding a little to volatility in the
funds rate.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1991-10-01,8,"(8) Market participants in recent days appear to have built
in some prospects for additional easing of monetary policy in the
period ahead. Nonetheless, the unchanged federal funds rate associ-
ated with alternative B is unlikely to engender a marked backup in
yields in financial markets over the intermeeting period, so long as
incoming nonfinancial and monetary data are mixed, as would be the
case under the staff's forecast. Under those circumstances, the re-
cently lower exchange value of the dollar, too, probably will be
sustained. With elevated federal borrowing needs over the intermeet-
ing period continuing to place upward pressure on Treasury yields,
rate spreads on private instruments over Treasury securities also
would be anticipated to stay relatively narrow.
","alternative B"
1991-11-05,8,"(9) The markets appear to have built in a high probability
of a further easing move in the period just ahead, and thus with the
unchanged funds rate of alternative B, other market interest rates may
tend to firm. The reversal in yields would be modest should incoming
data on the real economy point more decisively to faltering near-term
expansion, as in the staff forecast, engendering the expectation that
the next easing has only been postponed. Any rise in long-term yields
also would be mitigated to the extent that indications of a softening
in the economic outlook were seen as improving prospects for disinfla-
tion. However, quality spreads on bank and corporate debt would widen
marginally if the market's economic outlook turns more downbeat. If
rates do firm a little, the dollar could rise a bit on foreign ex-
change markets.

1992-03-31,8,"(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would
continue to trade around 4 percent in association with an initial bor-
rowing allowance of $100 million. Over the intermeeting period, the
borrowing allowance likely would need to be increased to accommodate a
rise in demands for seasonal credit, but probably by less than in pre-
vious years owing to the less attractive rate on such credit under the
new program. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline
to the 3-1/2 percent area in conjunction with a reduction in the initial
borrowing allowance to $75 million.5 In contrast, the funds rate
would return to 4-1/2 percent and the initial borrowing allowance would
increase to $125 million under alternative C. Under any of the alterna-
tives, the staff anticipates little difficulty in bank reserve manage-
ment from the cut in reserve requirements effective in early April, and
as a result there is unlikely to be much additional funds market vola-
tility. Part of the initial reduction in required reserve balances,
estimated at $8-1/2 billion, will be offset by the seasonal upsurge in
required reserves on transaction deposits; but even after this bulge
abates, the total of required reserves plus required clearing balances
should be above the level needed for clearing purposes.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1992-05-19,8,"(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Commit-
tee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue
trading in the 3-3/4 percent area; extending the current assumption of
$100 million for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing would be expected to
preserve the current 1/4 percentage point spread of the funds rate above
the discount rate, at least over the first part of the intermeeting
period.4 Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would drop to
count rate by lowering the initial specification for borrowing to $75
million, placing the federal funds rate below the discount rate. The
same federal funds rate could be achieved by cutting the discount rate
alternative B level of $100 million. Under the policy tightening of
alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise to 4-1/4 percent, in
association with higher initial borrowing of $125 million.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1992-08-18,8,"(8) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates would fall
by nearly the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate, espe-
cially were the easing to take the form of a discount rate cut, which
would be seen as implying that the reduction more likely would be sus-
tained. Banks would be expected to trim another 1/2 percentage point
off the prime rate, still preserving large spreads over funding costs.
Some market participants might read the easing as increased emphasis on
spurring economic activity, at the cost of limiting progress against
inflation. Nonetheless, given the outlook for tepid economic expansion
and slower inflation that recently has come to be more firmly embedded
in market expectations, nominal as well as real bond yields would be
likely to decline noticeably. Easing in the United States might lessen
constraints on more expansive monetary policies in a few other coun-
tries, but with many countries, especially in Europe, highly unlikely to
follow suit, the dollar would tend to depreciate significantly further.
","alternative A"
1992-10-06,8,"(8) Two alternatives are presented below for the Committee's
consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to
trade around 3 percent, in association with an initial assumption for
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $200 million.4  Under the
easier policy stance of alternative A, the expected federal funds rate
would be cut to 2-1/2 percent. Although moving the funds rate below the
discount rate is technically feasible, implementing this alternative
through a reduction of at least 1/2 point in the discount rate would
accord with the usual practice of keeping the expected funds rate at or
above the discount rate. With a 1/2 percentage point drop in the dis-
count rate, for example, an initial borrowing assumption of $200 million
would be retained under alternative A.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative A"
1992-12-22,8,"(8) The 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds rate
under alternative A would be passed through fully to other short-term
interest rates. The three-month Treasury bill rate would drop into the
to 5-1/2 percent. Market expectations about the trajectory of interest
rates over the next few months would be marked down, but anticipations
that the easing move might need to be reversed before much time had
passed--especially in the context of possible fiscal stimulus--would
limit declines in longer-term rates. The foreign exchange value of the
dollar could drop noticeably, although in present circumstances, foreign
central banks might ease their own policies somewhat sooner than they
are likely to otherwise, muting the dollar's decline.
","alternative A"
1993-03-23,8,"(8) Market participants are expecting neither tightening nor
easing in the stance of monetary policy for some time. They appear to
anticipate that the recent runup in inflation will subside in large
part. The gains in stock prices and sustained narrow quality spreads
suggest that investors now also believe that the bond market rally,
together with the economy's existing forward momentum, will keep the
contractionary effects of the deficit-reduction package from derailing
the economic expansion. Thus, under alternative B, short-term interest
rates would stay around current levels. Intermediate- and long-term
rates will remain sensitive to news on the fiscal front and correspond-
ing implications for the economy, as well as reports bearing on the
inflation outlook. Bond rates could edge lower should incoming news on
prices confirm the extent of moderation in inflation embodied in the
staff economic forecast. The dollar would be expected to fluctuate
around current levels under alternative B, but could firm somewhat if
rate declines in Europe prove to be faster and larger than now expected.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1993-05-18,8,"(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would
continue to trade around 3 percent, in association with the allowance
for adjustment and seasonal borrowing initially being maintained at its
current level of $100 million.5 Under alternative A, the federal
funds rate would be reduced to 2-1/2 percent. This reduction could be
achieved either by lowering the initial borrowing allowance by $25
million or by reducing the discount rate 1/2 percentage point while
leaving the allowance unchanged at $100 million. Federal funds would
trade in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 percent under alternative C, in
association with an initial borrowing allowance of $125 million.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1993-08-17,8,"(8) The interest rates under alternative B are consistent with
those of the staff Greenbook forecast, which has the federal funds rate
around current levels through 1994 and long-term rates edging lower. In
that forecast, persistent low levels of real short-term interest rates
are needed to counter fiscal drag and other impediments to economic
growth. Under these circumstances, the unemployment rate does not de-
cline from its current level, while core inflation slows only modestly.
With this configuration of income and interest rates, broad money ag-
gregates are projected to expand sluggishly while total nonfinancial
debt increases around the pace of nominal GDP.
","alternative B"
1994-03-22,8,"(8) Two monetary policy alternatives are presented below for
consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds
would continue to trade around 3-1/4 percent in association with ad-
justment plus seasonal borrowing of $75 million. Under alterna-
tive C, the federal funds rate would increase 50 basis points, to
to $100 million.
","alternative B"
1994-08-16,8,"(8) Alternative B might be preferred if it were thought that
there would be less strength in the economy than in the staff fore-
cast. Such a view might follow from placing more weight on recent
soft spending indicators, on undesired inventory buildups, or on the
effects of previous policy tightenings. Waiting for more clarifica-
tion of how much slowing in spending growth is already in train would
be seen as posing fewer risks than implied in the staff forecast if it
were thought that favorable readings on price indexes suggested that
some slack remained in the economy.
","Alternative B"
1994-09-27,8,"(8) Alternative B, which would retain current reserve condi-
tions, is not inconsistent with the staff assumption of policy firm-
ing, provided that firming resumes some time soon. Inaction might be
deemed particularly appropriate if the Committee believed that strains
on capacity could be less pressing than in the staff forecast, either
because potential output might be greater than assumed by the staff or
because more restraint on spending could be in the pipeline in view of
the substantial increases in interest rates over the past year. More-
over, slow growth of a broad array of monetary and credit aggregates
might be seen as suggesting that financial conditions are not con-
ducive to a pickup in underlying inflation. A pause would allow the
Committee to accumulate more evidence on these questions. Such a
wait-and-see posture would accord with the tone of the press statement
announcing the policy action taken at the August meeting.
","Alternative B"
1995-01-31,8,"(8) This section addresses several issues related to longer-
run strategies for monetary policy and their interaction with underly-
ing macroeconomic conditions. The first set of scenarios examines two
alternative strategies for monetary policy. The strategies embed
different assumptions about the economic outcomes that the Committee
would find acceptable but assume the same underlying macroeconomic
forces and relationships. The baseline strategy begins with the
Greenbook's baseline projection for 1995 and 1996; it envisions a
gradual rise in the unemployment rate to its natural rate by 2000 to
cap inflation, which levels off at about 3-1/2 percent. The tighter
strategy extends the Greenbook's ""alternative simulation"" and puts
inflation on a downward path consistent with achieving price stability
early in the next decade. The next two sets of scenarios involve
alternative assumptions about fiscal policy and the level of the
natural rate of unemployment.
","alternative a"
1995-03-28,8,"(8) A key element in assessing the appropriate stance of
policy going forward is the interpretation of the causes and conse-
quences of the sizeable movements in prices on securities and foreign
exchange markets over recent months. As discussed in paragraph 2, the
drop in dollar interest and exchange rates seemed primarily a response
to the perceived softening in aggregate demand. The question is
whether the market reaction has been appropriate to the new informa-
tion in the sense of leaving rates at levels consistent with the Com-
mittee's objectives for the economy and prices. With an unchanged
federal funds rate in the staff forecast, interest and exchange rates
close to recent levels are associated with activity growing slowly
enough to move the economy back to the neighborhood of its potential
and core CPI inflation flattening out at a somewhat higher rate than
in 1994. If the Committee believes such an outcome were both likely
and acceptable, then it may be inclined to leave the current level of
the federal funds rate in place, as under alternative B, unless and
until incoming economic data or a clarification of prospective fiscal
policy begin to point to a different outlook.
","alternative B"
1995-05-23,8,"(8) Incoming data show both rising inflation and a weakening
of economic activity over recent months. Looking forward, a key issue
for monetary policy is whether either of these developments will per-
sist. In the staff forecast, with short-term interest rates main-
tained at current levels, neither of these risks materializes. In
effect, interest and exchange rates close to their prevailing con-
figuration are seen as consistent with the economy producing just
above its long-run capacity. A near-term inventory correction limits
the expansion of production in the second and third quarters, taking
pressure off resources. The unemployment rate ends up close to the
natural rate, growth is at its potential, and the core rate of con-
sumer price inflation runs at just over 3 percent in 1996. If the
Committee sees the staff forecast as the likely and desired outcome
and the risks around it to be reasonably well-balanced, then selection
of unchanged reserve market conditions, as under alternative B, would
be favored.
","alternative B"
1995-08-22,8,"(8) Financial markets still see slight odds of a monetary
easing by year-end, but they do not expect any action at the August
FOMC meeting. Thus, the choice of the unchanged federal funds rate of
alternative B should have little immediate impact on market interest
rates. Over the intermeeting period, data in line with the staff's
forecast of a pickup in output growth to a moderate pace might remove
any lingering expectations of policy ease among market participants;
but with inflation also projected to be quite subdued, substantial
shifts in the anticipated course of policy are unlikely. At the cur-
rent ceiling for federal government debt, the staff does not expect
the Treasury to alter financing patterns much until late September or
to run out of cash until the first half of November. Nonetheless, as
the room under the debt ceiling shrinks, absent signs of some narrow-
ing of the differences between the President and congressional
leaders, financial markets may begin to focus more on the implications
for debt markets and the economy of a disruption in federal financing.
or possibly even a temporary default. To date, interest rates appear
to have been unaffected by the possibility of such a disruption, and
over the intermeeting period, which ends before the new fiscal year,
markets will probably remain of the view that in the end some com-
promise will be reached to avert the most dire consequences.
","alternative B"
1996-03-26,8,"(8) An unchanged policy stance, as in alternative B, would
probably be preferred if the Committee concurred with the staff's as-
sessment of the economy, viewed potential risks as about evenly
balanced, and was willing to accept the possibility of a slight inten-
sification of price pressures. Of course, this alternative might be
even more attractive if the Committee saw smaller odds of rising in-
flation, as it did in January judging from the CPI forecasts submitted
by the members. Moreover, in light of the unusual number of temporary
disruptions and distortions to economic activity in the last few
months and the difficulties in understanding the implications of the
recent movements of stock and bond prices, a pause might be favored to
allow sufficient time to establish a firmer bearing on the likely
course of spending and inflation, even if the Committee saw the risks
to the outlook as possibly tilted to one side or the other.
","alternative B"
1996-08-20,8,"(8) Nonetheless, the Committee may well feel that it can
afford to wait, as in alternative B, for additional data to accumulate
to allow a more confident judgment concerning whether an underlying
process of rising inflation seems to be taking hold. Arguably, the
upturn in the compensation trend is not firmly established in a
statistical sense, leaving questions about the level of the NAIRU.
And even if wages have begun to accelerate, the profit share may be
sufficiently high to cushion the extent to which faster increases in
labor compensation are passed through to prices for a time. Even if
the staff assessment of emerging price pressures is confirmed, with
the economy still close to its potential, the pickup in inflation
would be gradual. Consequently, as long as a slowdown in real GDP
growth of the dimension foreseen by the staff still appears to be in
train, the case for an immediate policy tightening may not be seen as
compelling. While keeping policy on hold for a time in these cir-
cumstances might imply the need for a greater tightening later to
reverse the pickup in inflation, so long as the action were not post-
poned too long, a wrenching adjustment to output should be avoidable.
","alternative B"
1996-09-24,8,"(8) The Committee thus might view such an inflation outcome
as unacceptable. Nonetheless, there are reasons why the Committee
might choose the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B for the
upcoming intermeeting period. Although labor markets are tight and
wages accelerating, the extent and timing of any feedthrough of this
acceleration to overall compensation and ultimately prices remain
uncertain. Real interest rates are in the neighborhood of levels that
over the past fifteen years have been associated on average with
little change in inflation, and the growth of money and credit has
been moderate, suggesting perhaps that if the stance of policy is
stimulative, it may not be greatly so. Indeed, the staff forecast has
only a gradual pickup in core inflation, which in any event will start
from a level in the third quarter that is probably lower than the
Committee had anticipated. In these circumstances, waiting to assess
better the economic situation might not incur much risk of a signifi-
cant deterioration in inflation expectations, provided the delay were
not too long, because containing inflation will still be possible
before it has risen appreciably above the general level of recent
years. Moreover, the soft cast to the recent trend of retail sales
and continued surprisingly favorable readings on broad price indexes
may lead the Committee to consider the staff forecast as too pessimis-
tic about likely inflation pressures. If so, inflation is more apt to
be kept within acceptable bounds without policy adjustment.
","alternative B"
1996-11-13,8,"(8) A policy tightening, such as the 50 basis point firming of
the federal funds rate under alternative C, might be favored should
the Committee wish to move promptly to counter the updrift in
underlying inflation embedded in the staff outlook. Furthermore, the
Committee may be concerned about additional upside risks to the
inflation outlook: For example, recent wage data may be misleading
and the widely reported tightness of labor markets could be reflected
soon in much more sizable increases in labor costs. Or spending might
snap back more forcefully than envisioned by the staff--especially in
light of the recent rallies in bond and stock markets--and intensify
pressures on resource utilization.
","alternative C"
1996-12-17,8,"(8) Nonetheless, the need for an immediate policy tightening could be
questioned. The estimated output gap and underlying inflation pressures in 1997 and
uncertain that there would be any deterioration in inflation, in light of the relatively
good behavior of prices recently in the face of both a drop in the unemployment rate
below most estimates of NAIRU and adverse supply side shocks in food and energy
prices. Moreover, levels of key financial variables going forward may seem especially
uncertain, given the exceptional volatility in bond, stock, and foreign exchange mar-
kets recently. Such skittish market conditions may make responses to policy actions
particularly hard to predict. In these circumstances, the Committee may wish to keep
policy unchanged (alternative B), awaiting more information to assess how markets
may evolve and how the other uncertainties may be resolved.
","alternative B"
1997-03-25,8,"(8) With market participants apparently placing high odds on a 25 basis point
tightening in the federal funds rate at the March meeting, interest rates probably would fall
somewhat if the unchanged policy of alternative B were adopted. Nonetheless, many
observers would likely continue to view tightening as inevitable, unless economic growth
slows to an unexpected degree, and these expectations would limit the decline in long-term
rates and any softening in the dollar. Indeed, if data in the weeks ahead come in as the staff
projects -- strong real GDP growth and the unemployment rate declining -- both short- and
long-term interest rates would back up, with long-term rates possibly more than reversing any
initial rally.
","alternative B"
1997-05-20,8,"(8) Despite the staffs perception that underlying inflation pressures will be
building, the Committee may find reasons to leave its policy stance unchanged, at least for
the time being, as incorporated in alternative B, which keeps the intended federal funds rate
at 5-1/2 percent. In the Greenbook forecast, the expansion of real GDP abruptly slows by
enough to keep resource utilization from increasing further. The Committee may feel that
there is a reasonable chance that the rates of resource use in the forecast could be associated
with more subdued inflation than the staff expects. Data becoming available since the last
meeting indicate a continuing damped response of prices and costs to unemployment rates
that were once regarded as well below sustainable levels, underscoring the heightened
uncertainties of recent years about the relationship between resource use and inflation. Even
if labor costs do accelerate as the staff projects, the higher profit share of late could provide
an even greater buffer against the effects on prices than the staff has assumed, damping
inflation rates for some time to come. The argument for standing pat would be stronger still
if one gave appreciable weight to the notion that real short-term interest rates already had
moved to relatively high levels, providing some insulation against the risk that overly rapid
economic growth would resume.
","alternative B"
1997-08-19,8,"(8) Market participants uniformly do not expect a near-term policy move by the
Federal Reserve, and selection of alternative B by the Committee should elicit little imme-
diate market reaction. Thus, short-term interest rates generally would remain close to current
levels, as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar, though Treasury bill rates could
continue to edge up as supply constraints ease further with the seasonal widening of the
federal deficit. In longer-term markets, prices are likely to remain more volatile than over the
spring and early summer as participants assess incoming data for clues about whether the
recent exceptional confluence of strong growth, high levels of resource utilization, and low
inflation can persist. However, data over the intermeeting period consistent with the staff
forecast would likely prove somewhat reassuring in this regard, because they would show the
economy growing at a moderate pace and inflation remaining damped. In these circum-
stances, long-term yields could move lower over the weeks ahead.
","alternative B"
1997-09-30,8,"(8) Virtually no one in the market anticipates action at this meeting, so that yields
across the term structure are not likely to budge much and the dollar should continue to trade
around its current level on foreign exchange markets immediately following the adoption of
the unchanged policy stance of alternative B. Treasury bill rates have been depressed of late
by low issuance, and the turnaround in bill sales in the fourth quarter prompted by the
seasonal bulge in the federal deficit may roll back some of the decline in rates on those
securities. Over time, if economic developments unfold as in the staff forecast, market
participants are in store for some disappointment: Inflation will be a touch faster, providing a
context in which expected strength in readings on economic activity are more likely to be
taken as evidence that higher real rates are required to slow spending to contain price
pressures, and corporate profits should decelerate. Against this backdrop, nominal yields
would likely edge higher, with both their real and inflation compensation components rising,
and equity prices would likely decline.
","alternative B"
1998-03-31,8,"(8) The unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B might be favored if the
Committee saw the staff forecast as a likely outcome and one that appropriately balanced the
goals of restraining inflation and sustaining expansion over the next few years, or, at a
minimum, if it viewed the risks of substantially different and less desirable outcomes on
either side of the staff forecast as about equal at the current federal funds rate. Even if the
Committee suspected that the odds were tilted a bit either toward a stronger economy and
greater price pressures or toward a weaker economy and more disinflation than desired,
awaiting additional evidence to indicate better the direction of the economy might not be too
costly in current circumstances. For example, if underlying pressures in labor markets
intensify, the effects of lower import prices should damp inflation and inflation expectations
for a time, permitting the Committee to tighten before significantly higher inflation becomes
embedded in wage and price decisions. Conversely, in the event of greater drag from Asia
than anticipated in the staff forecast, the underlying strength of domestic demand appears to
be strong enough to sustain economic expansion for a while until an easier policy is adopted
and has time to take hold.
","alternative B"
1998-05-19,8,"(8) If the Committee views the Greenbook forecast as both likely and acceptable, it
might be inclined to maintain its current 5-1/2 percent intended federal funds rate, as under
alternative B. Although that forecast has an underlying upward tilt to inflation in 1999 as
labor markets remain quite tight, that tilt is gradual and starts from a lower inflation rate in
tendencies of members' CPI projections in February.2 Even if the Committee were troubled
by the underlying uptrend of inflation in the staff forecast, it might still be willing to adopt
the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B. The vulnerable state of many financial
markets in Asia, which could react adversely to an increase in U.S. interest rates, might weigh
against action at this time. When the Committee's directive tilt was disclosed prematurely in
late April, interest rates in those markets rose along with dollar interest rates, indeed by
somewhat more than those here. In addition, the Committee may feel that a small uptick in
underlying inflation, should it unfold as in the staff forecast, would generate only minimal
costs in potential resource distortions and could be readily countered in the future. If so, the
Committee may be willing to accept the significant probability of such an uptick through
economy will prove able to sustain the high operating rate built into the staff forecast without
a rise in underlying inflation.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1998-08-18,8,"(8) Although the staff forecast envisions a relatively benign domestic macroeconomic
outcome under current money market conditions, the Committee might be concerned either that
in the staff forecast progress toward price stability was stalling or that in its own view inflation
was more likely to escalate noticeably. In either case, it may prefer to apply additional monetary
restraint at this meeting, as in the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate of
alternative C. A prediction of worsening inflation pressures might be based in part on
unambiguously tight labor market conditions and the uptrend already evident in wages and
compensation. The odds on much softening of labor markets might be seen as low in light of the
surprising momentum of domestic demand, which has been sustaining growth of employment
and income. And while the Committee recently decided not to tighten, in part because of
unsettled conditions abroad, a continued absence of action would not be desirable if the
Committee were reasonably confident that the domestic economic situation was pointing to
higher inflation rates before very long. In such a situation, delay would only increase the degree
of tightening that would ultimately be necessary. Delayed but greater tightening could be even
more disruptive to financial markets, since economies abroad may not be sufficiently improved
and markets sufficiently settled to absorb the heavier blow.
","alternative C"
1998-11-17,8,"(8) The Committee may find such a pattern to be relatively attractive if it believes that
the economy is operating beyond a sustainable level, but wishes to reduce the pressures on
resources only gradually; inflation still stays fairly quiescent, and financial markets strike a better
balance between the frothy conditions of recent years and the extreme risk aversion evident in
recent months. A slight additional easing at this meeting, as in the 25 basis point reduction in the
federal funds rate of alternative A, could be considered broadly in line with the policy
assumption underlying the staff forecast.2 The case for an immediate easing would be
strengthened if the Committee thought that the risks to the staffs economic outlook were
distinctly skewed to the downside, perhaps owing to the possibility of more adverse
developments in Latin America. In addition, a prompt policy easing would be more likely than
would standing pat to lessen the odds on a reemergence of anything like the earlier extreme
reluctance to take on risk that had caused rates on private securities to back up and had
threatened to retard economic activity. Indeed, such an easing action might be expected to foster
continued normalization of financial conditions here and abroad. An easing also might reduce
the chances, or at least lessen the effects, of possible funding problems at some financial
institutions, particularly around year end, that could interfere with credit intermediation. Finally,
an easing would help to offset some of the effects of both the tightening in lending terms and
standards at commercial banks that has been under way and the softness in global economic
activity that has been exacerbated by further weakness in Japan.
","alternative A"
1999-03-30,8,"(8) Continuing the current stance of policy, as envisioned in alternative B, would
match the expectations currently embodied in financial market prices. As a result, the immediate
market reaction to no adjustment in the federal funds rate should be little movement in other
interest rates or in the exchange value of the dollar. Over time, if output were to decelerate and
underlying inflation to remain contained, as in the staff forecast, long-term interest rates should
fluctuate around their current levels, although, as Congress and the administration address budget
issues, markets might become more sensitive to developments regarding the burgeoning federal
budget surplus. With the economic environment remaining benign and concerns about near-term
monetary policy tightening mostly quiescent, major equity price indexes are likely to be little
changed on net, despite pressure on corporate profit margins.
","alternative B"
1999-05-18,8,"(8) If the Committee believes that inflation pressures could well be damped for
some time, it might prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as in
alternative B. The staff forecast shows only a gradual pickup in core inflation to a relatively
low level, at least through 2000. In that environment, and in light of the considerable degree
of uncertainty regarding the economy's supply side, the Committee may want to wait to get a
firmer handle on the likely extent of price pressures before acting. The Committee might see
a significant probability of more restraint on cost pressures going forward than in the staff
forecast from, for example, a lesser slowing in productivity growth or an extension of the
recent subdued pace of wage gains. The Committee might also be encouraged by the
behavior of bond rates over recent weeks, which suggests that investors respond promptly to
signs the economy might begin to overheat and, by anticipating future monetary policy
firming, impart some restraint to spending before the Federal Reserve takes action.
","alternative B"
1999-08-24,8,"(8) Despite the pickup in underlying inflation in the staff forecast, the Committee
may nonetheless prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as under
alternative B. The projected pickup in inflation, if realized, would be gradual and not likely
for some time to foster an appreciable increase in inflation expectations that could
destabilize financial markets or materially increase the ultimate cost to economic activity of
containing price pressures. Accordingly, policy makers would be afforded more time to
judge whether the rise in inflation in fact is likely to materialize. Such additional time might
be viewed as especially desirable if the Committee were to put less weight than the staff on
the possibility that underlying inflation trends are adverse. Recent data may suggest that
spending is on a lower trajectory than in the staff forecast--particularly because domestic
demand likely has not yet felt much of the effects of the run-up in interest rates and
flattening out of equity prices since early May. While some of the recent restraint from
financial markets would be rolled back should the Committee fail to validate prevailing
expectations of policy tightening, financial conditions on net could well remain more
restrictive than those that generally have prevailed this year. And the Committee may see
the wage and cost data as sufficiently ambiguous to reserve judgment on whether the
current level of tautness in labor markets will produce accelerating prices, especially since
trends in core consumer inflation and longer-run inflation expectations remain flat.
Moreover, recent developments may indicate that global financial markets are fragile, with
the potential for further deterioration as year-end approaches even absent a firming in
","alternative B"
1999-10-05,8,"(8) An unchanged intended federal funds rate, as under alternative B, along with
retention of a symmetric directive, would foster the sense that the Committee probably will
not act over the remainder of this year, especially given Y2K-related uncertainties.5 With
market prices now incorporating some odds on a tightening in the fourth quarter, this
Committee decision could spark a modest rally in financial markets. The choice of
alternative B with a tilt toward tightening, which would be announced immediately, would
tend to increase the perceived chances of a near-term firming, causing interest rates to back
up slightly and markets to become more sensitive to incoming data and to statements by
policymakers. In any event, banks and other lenders are likely to remain cautious suppliers
of funds to private borrowers as the year-end approaches, especially short-term credit whose
repayment could be viewed as potentially impaired for a little while by disruptions in
markets or the particular problems of individual counterparties. Year-end premiums in
money markets typically jump early in the fourth quarter, but in some years they have
declined subsequently as borrowers satisfied their needs. Spread movements, of course, are
subject to greater uncertainty with the century date change. This year borrowers seem to be
securing financing somewhat earlier than the norm, which may help to relieve some
pressures, though not by enough to prevent spreads from remaining quite elevated.
","alternative B, alternative B"
2000-05-16,8,"(8) Even if the Committee's assessment of the outlook is such that a substantial
firming of policy ultimately will be necessary to prevent underlying inflation from rising, it
still may favor a continued gradual approach, as under alternative C. Signs of an actual
acceleration in prices are quite recent, and the Committee may require further evidence that
inflation is on the upswing before firming policy more aggressively. While some measures of
labor compensation gains recently have shown signs of strengthening, this development may
be largely a lagged response to previous increases in productivity growth rather than a signal
of heightened inflation pressures. Moreover, the elevated uncertainty about the economy's
sustainable level of resource utilization and rate of output growth--which contributes to the
sense that forecasts of inflation are less reliable--might justify continuing the incremental
approach to policy firming. Continued gradualism would afford the Federal Reserve more
time to assess the responsiveness of the economy and inflation to the cumulative change in
the stance of monetary policy, thereby limiting the risk of possible over-tightening. And, to
the extent that market participants extrapolate the gradual approach to policy tightening into
the future, expectations of further policy restraint will remain embedded in the structure of
market interest rates, still bringing forward in time the effects on spending of future policy
","alternative C"
2000-08-22,8,"(8) Although the odds that pressures on resources will not intensify may seem
better balanced now than they did eight weeks ago, the Committee may still see the risks as
tilted toward an unacceptable inflation outcome, given the persisting strength in elements of
aggregate demand, the low unemployment rate, and the somewhat elevated current rate of
core inflation. The choice of alternative B, accompanied by a sentence conveying a balance
of risks weighted in an inflationary direction, would accord with the expectations of market
participants. No significant immediate response would be forthcoming in financial markets.
Under the staff forecast, economic data over the intermeeting period are likely to continue to
indicate moderate demand growth and contained inflation and thus should have little net
effect on market prices.
","alternative B"
2000-10-03,8,"(8) Market prices incorporate the expectation that the target federal funds rate and
the balance-of-risks sentence will be left unchanged at this meeting. Consequently,
implementation of alternative B, along with the retention of the statement that the
Committee regarded the balance of risks as weighted toward increased inflationary pressures,
should have little effect on financial markets. The Committee might well see the revised
outlook for oil prices, coming at a time when it was already concerned about potential price
pressures from the unusually low unemployment rate, as reinforcing a judgment that the
balance of risks is weighted toward higher inflation. However, the Committee may now
believe that growth of aggregate demand is not likely to exceed that of potential output, that
current levels of resource utilization are sustainable, and that oil prices probably will not
leave a lasting imprint on inflation. If so, it could consider issuing a statement that indicated
balanced risks to achieving its goals for price stability and sustainable economic growth. In
this case, bond and equity markets would likely rally, as investors marked up the odds on an
easing trend in monetary policy over coming months, and the value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets would probably edge lower.
","alternative B"
2000-12-19,8,"(8) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment of the economic
fundamentals and views a period of subpar economic growth as not only likely but
also necessary to stabilize core inflation, it might prefer the unchanged federal funds
rate of alternative B. In addition, recent substantial revisions to the near-term
outlook may suggest that the economic situation is quite fluid and that the degree of
conviction about any particular outcome is relatively low. Leaving policy unchanged
would provide time for more evidence to accumulate that could potentially clarify the
outlook for spending and productivity growth. Of course, this benefit must be
weighed against the potential costs of inaction. In the current circumstances, the
Committee may view economic conditions as implying that the potential costs of
inaction at this meeting would be lower than usual if economic outcomes turn out
differently than now anticipated. On the one hand, in the event of somewhat slower-
than-expected economic growth going forward, the quicker dissipation of labor
market pressures resulting from a short delay in easing policy might not be
unwelcome, given that labor markets are very tight and inflation is probably at the
high end of the range that might be considered acceptable in the long run. If, on the
other hand, pressures on prices intensify because economic growth rebounds more
promptly than expected or unit labor costs accelerate, then the Committee should
have sufficient time to react before higher inflation becomes entrenched because long-
term inflation expectations appear to be firmly anchored.
","alternative B"
2004-03-16,8,"(8) At its last meeting, the Committee instructed the staff to include a more
complete analysis in the Bluebook of possible wording choices for the policy
announcement (see box entitled Some General Issues Concerning Statement
Language).  Given current economic circumstances and the Committees January
policy announcement, the staff viewed a change in the federal funds rate at this
Some General Issues Concerning Statement Language
As is evident in the chart below, the words of the FOMCs statements are important:  The
overall tone and content of FOMC statements can elicit significant immediate market
reactions and sometimes may color the way market participants respond to subsequent
incoming news and events.  But while words matter in FOMC communications,
statement language should not be viewed as an independent instrument of monetary policy. 
Presumably, the statement influences markets because participants believe that it conveys
information that bears directly or indirectly on potential future policy actions.  Thus, at least
over the longer run, the importance of statement language depends on its connection with
observed policy actions.
The likely market reaction to an FOMC statement is hard to judge.  When the policy rate is
changed, one can forecast the market reaction by using surveys and interest rate futures to
measure ex-ante market expectations.  When only the wording of the announcement is
changed, predicting the market reaction is much more problematic.  There is no simple way
to map alternative wording in FOMC statements into basis-point equivalents to arrive at
the analogue of a policy rate change.  And even if this were possible, one would still need to
know the language that the market expects.  These caveats notwithstanding, the discussion
in this Bluebook does hazard speculations about likely market reactions to alternative
FOMC statements; these represent the staffs best guesses of the likely market reactions,
but the confidence intervals are quite wide.

Alternative B
","Alternative B"
2004-05-04,8,"(8) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Alternatives A and B
assume that the federal funds rate holds at 1 percent but differ as to the Committees
characterization of the strength of the economy and its willingness to be patient in
removing policy accommodation.  Alternative C contemplates a quarter-point firming
and aligns the wording of the statement accordingly.  Under any of these alternatives,
several changes seem necessary to update the characterization of economic
conditions.  In particular, with employment growth averaging 170,000 per month over
the first three months of the year, the rationale paragraph could indicate that hiring
appears to have picked up.  And the unexpectedly high inflation figures could be
acknowledged by stating that incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher.
Assuming that the Committee now sees the odds of a significant further decline in
inflation as remote, the assessment-of-risks paragraph should indicate that the upside
and downside risks to the goal of price stability are seen as roughly equal.

In current circumstances, the Committee believes
that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if

The first two alternatives propose a structure of the announcement fairly close to that
employed at the last meeting.  Alternative C, however, offers a substantial departure
from the form and substance of recent announcements.  It involves an assessment
that the risks to growth and inflation are tilted to the upsideconditioned explicitly
on an unchanged stance of policy following the actionand elimination of the
measured pace sentence.  Paragraph 18 discusses a hybrid of Alternatives B and C in
which the funds rate would be increased 25 basis points while some of the language
proposed for Alternative C would be incorporated in the announcement.  Regarding
the rationale section of the announcement, the Committees characterization of the
labor market, and possibly of the economic outlook more generally, may be affected
by the release on Friday of the employment report for July.  If that report comes in
about as the staff expects, the Committee might wish to indicate, as under
Alternatives B and C, that labor market conditions continue to improve.  However, if the
report is again on the soft side, as in June, the Committee might wish to cite some

appropriate to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points at this

included in Chart 6.  At the same time, though, some forces evidently are still
weighing on current and prospective economic performance in a manner that may
incline the Committee to be cautious about the extent and speed with which it
removes policy accommodation.  In particular, crude oil prices, while falling back
somewhat in recent weeks, remain high and could continue to limit growth in
aggregate demand.  Looking forward, fiscal policy is poised to shift from stimulus to
restraint at the end of this year as the investment expensing provision expires.  And
recent news on spending for high-tech equipment has been less upbeat.

which makes mention of developments earlier this year less relevant.  The description
of the labor market will depend importantly on the employment report released
tomorrow, but, as a placeholder, the entry in the table describes conditions as having
improved modestly.  If economic circumstances diverge significantly from this
characterization, staff will circulate alternative language in advance of Wednesdays

response to recent Board actions and as to the likely changes in the
recent substantial differentials in costs of Euro-dollars as against
domestic funds. Even under these alternatives, it should be recognized
that a resumption of decline in Euro-dollar borrowings is a real possi-
bility. Under alternative C, declining market interest rates would
very likely encourage some further shift away from Euro-dollar borrow-
ings absent additional Board action. Outstanding bank-related commercial
paper is expected to continue declining, though at a slower pace. In
general, growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's may
be dampened as post-strike auto sales tend to impinge on the personal
saving rate. Under alternative A, such growth is projected to be a
little less in the first quarter than in the fourth, but under alterna-
tives B and C, time deposits are assumed to grow somewhat more rapidly
because market interest rates would be relatively lower. Bank interest
in large CD's is likely to be fairly strong, as they continue to want
to acquire market securities and as business loan demand picks up.

1971-01-12,9,"(9) Realization of alternative A aggregates would require, in
the staff's judgment, pushing the Federal funds rate up from its recent
trading range of around 4-1/2 per cent. With nominal GNP projected to
rise at an 11.7 per cent rate in the first quarter, strong transaction
demands for money and a pick-up in short-term private credit demands are
expected. Should the GNP projection and these money and credit demands
be realized, short-term rates would rise in the process of keeping money
growth down to 6 per cent. Although a tightening of the money market
following a reduction in the discount rate would be rather puzzling

to the market, it would probably be interpreted as an effort to keep

move back up toward the new 5-1/4 per cent discount rate. Marginal

the net free reserve position of member banks is likely to average $150

1971-05-11,9,"(9) Although recent foreign exchange market developments heighten
all the usual uncertainties in assessing the future, the relationships among
money market conditions and monetary aggregates that have evolved since the
last meeting of the Committee strongly suggest that the FOMC's desires expressed
at the last Committee meeting with respect to aggregates for the second quarter
will not be achieved under prevailing money market conditions. Given such
money market conditions, the table on the next page compares the Committee's
desires for the aggregates with current expectations. (The paths shown as
""desired"" take the June levels for the aggregates indicated in the previous
Blue Book under alternative C as targets. The annual rates of change for
April and the second quarter differ in many cases from those shown in the
previous Blue Book because the March levels for the aggregates have been
revised since the last Committee meeting. For example the March level of M1
was revised up by $400 million to $219.4 billion. Thus the level of $222.4
billion for M 1 in June represented a 6 per cent annual rate of growth over the
second quarter at the time of the last Committee meeting, but it now represents
a 5-1/2 per cent rate of growth.)

of growth are shown in this summary table for M 1 (taken to represent the
collection of aggregates) to highlight the sharply diminished rates of growth
that might be expected by late summer, particularly if money market condi-
tions are to be tightened significantly further. In specifying the constella-
tion of money market conditions, it should be pointed out that as the Federal
funds rate moves above the discount rate, bank attitudes toward use of the
discount window will change, with consequent uncertainties in estimating the
expected level of member bank borrowings during such a transition period.

1971-08-24,9,"(9) Two broad policy approaches are described below which pro-
bably define the limits within which most would consider a neutralist policy
to fall. Both, as it happens, might be characterized--in their own contexts--
as policies calling for minimum change. The first specifies the maintenance
of current money market conditions, a course which the staff believes would
imply some weakening after August in the growth rates of the aggregates
from those associated with the policy accepted at the last meeting. The
second would specify maintenance of^ growth in M at the rate consistent with
the directive adopted at the last meeting, a course which in our view would
require an easing of money market conditions. The specifications given
for the second alternative (B) might also be employed with directive
language presented in a later section under the label of alternative C.
As noted in that section, C differs from B with respect to operating
techniques rather than objectives. Specifically, under C the Desk would
place main emphasis on bank reserves rather than on money market conditions
in making operating decisions.
","alternative C"
1971-09-21,9,"(9) As compared with the first seven months of the year, the
growth in M1 is expected to continue at a sharply reduced rate between
now and year-end--particularly if money market conditions do not ease
significantly from around prevailing levels--as the lagged effects on
domestic cash demands of earlier higher short-term interest rates take
hold and as precautionary demands for cash are reduced further in the
wake of the President's program. Under alternative A--which contemplates
a Federal funds rate in a 5--5-5/8 per cent range--the annual rate of growth
in M1 is likely to be only about one or two per cent in September and around
currently anticipated from September to October mainly in consequence of an
expected drop in U.S. Government deposits from their unusually high mid-
September level. Under alternative C, money supply growth would be expected
to be a little more rapid in the fourth quarter than under alternative A.
In the first quarter of next year, growth in M1 would be expected to be
more rapid under either alternative, as transactions demands for cash--which
would rise along with projected nominal GNP growth in the fourth quarter
-- strengthen further. The pick-up could be quite modest under alternative
A, however, while under alternative C the cumulative impact of lower interest
rates could lead to a return to growth rates of around 6 per cent or so.
","alternative A, alternative C, alternative A, alternative

1971-11-16,9,"(9) Money market conditions consistent with alternative A/B
might encompass a Federal funds rate in a 4-1/2--4-7/8 per cent range;
member bank borrowings in a $150-$300 million range; and, taking account
of recent wide swings in excess reserves, a net reserve position for
member banks in a plus $250 million to minus $150 million area. These
conditions are somewhat easier than prevailed at the time of the last
Committee meeting, and reflect a response over the past few weeks to the
weakness of the monetary aggregates and, in recent days, to the reduction
in the discount rate. Alternative C would imply a significant further
easing of money market conditions from those that have recently evolved,
with, for example, the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with
this alternative in a 3-7/8--4-1/2 per cent range.
","alternative A, Alternative C"
1972-01-11,9,"(9) The proposed language for alternative B follows:
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to
promote the degree of ease in bank reserve and money market
conditions essential to] SYSTEM OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS UNTIL
THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE SHALL BE CONDUCTED WITH A
VIEW TO SUPPLYING THE BANK RESERVES NEEDED TO SUPPORT greater
growth in monetary aggregates; [DEL: over the months ahead, while
taking account of international developments] PROVIDED THAT
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS DO NOT FLUCTUATE OVER AN UNDULY WIDE
If the Committee were to take this course in its operating instructions,
the Manager would be guided initially in his reserve supplying operations
by a target path for reserves thought to be consistent with whatever aggre-
gate targets the Committee adopts. The estimates for total reserves,
seasonally adjusted and rounded, consistent with the proposed targets I and
II are shown in the table; and detailed weekly and monthly seasonally un-
adjusted figures have been prepared for use if this alternative procedure
is adopted.
","alternative B"
1972-05-23,9,"(9) The bill rate is likely to be under downward pressure from
market forces over the near-term, as the Treasury is expected to repay almost
$4 billion of publicly-held issues maturing in June. Board staff projections
indicate the Treasury is likely to have to borrow a sizable amount of new
money--perhaps around $8 billion--in July and August, but projections by the
Treasury suggest a considerably smaller cash need. The market at the moment
seems to be assuming a cash need close to our estimates, and anticipation of
such a need could serve to offset downward pressure on the bill rate as June
progresses, as could possible net sales of bills from foreign accounts.
But the principal source of near-term upward pressure on bill rates would be a
tendency for the Federal funds rate to edge up from recent levels. This would
be particularly likely under alternatives B and C, but even could occur under
alternative A. If demands for bank reserves and for money are not as strong
as assumed, however, the funds rate and other short-term rates would, of
course, be correspondingly reduced for any given rate of bank reserve provision.

cent annual rates of growth in M1, respectively) the staff would expect upward

pressure on short-term interest rates to emerge sooner and to carry rates to
higher levels than under alternative A. It is likely that Treasury bill rates
by some time in early 1973 would move above ceiling rates on consumer-type
time deposits (for which the highest rate is 5-3/4 per cent on 2-year and over
maturities), thus raising the odds on a substantial slowing in time deposit
inflows to banks by late in the first quarter. As a result, M2 growth,
particularly under alternative C, is targeted to slow more than M1 growth.
Net inflows to nonbank savings institutions, whose ceiling rates on time
certificates are 1/4 percentage point higher than banks, would also come
under pressure, though not importantly perhaps until the second quarter.
(9) In long-term markets, credit demand pressures from private
sectors are expected to remain moderate into the winter. However, given its
large cash needs, the Treasury seems likely to tap all possible sources,
including the bond market, to satisfy its financing requirements. In general,
though, long-term markets are most vulnerable to upward rate pressures from
the supply of funds side. The institutional supply of funds would likely be
constrained under alternative C, and to a smaller degree under B. And as
interest rates began to rise, there might be some temporary investor withdrawal
from long-term commitments of funds.
","alternative A, alternative C, alternative C"
1973-02-13,9,"(9) Transaction demands for money will be expanding in the
first half of 1973, given the projected rise in nominal GNP of almost
market interest rates will likely be acting to retard demand for money
between now and mid-year. Thus, the financial relationships tabulated
in the next paragraph for Committee consideration suggest that the longer-
run target path that encompasses a 5--6 per cent annual rate of growth for
ML might be attained with little change from current money market conditions
(alternative B). Moving down into a 4--5 per cent growth rate range for M1
would likely involve a tightening of the money market over the next few
weeks (alternative C), and moving up to a 6--7 per cent rate would probably
entail an easing (alternative A).
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1973-06-18,9,"(9) The three alternative dashed lines take as a base, or
starting point, the average level of M1 in June that would be consistent
with the mid-point of the 5--5-1/2 per cent growth rate adopted by the
Committee in March (which in turn starts from the March level then expected).
Because of the recent rapid growth in M1, the actual level of M1 expected
for June (the circled point on the chart) is $1.2 billion in excess of the
level consistent with the previously adopted 5-1/4 per cent path. Accordingly,
a Committee decision to adhere to that longer-term growth path would require
a correction in the rate of expansion over the period ahead. If the correction
were to be completed within the next two quarters, growth from the indicated
June level to December would have to be at a 4-1/2 per cent rate (alternative B).
Similarly, as a result of the recent overshoot, a Committee decision to move
onto a higher 6-1/2 per cent long-run target growth path (alternative A) or

onto a lower 4 per cent path (alternative C) would imply growth from the
indicated June level to December at rates somewhat slower than those path rates.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1973-07-17,9,"(9) Under all three alternatives growth in the monetary
aggregates would be slower in the second half of 1973 than in the first
half. Money demand is expected to moderate because of a slowing in the
rate of growth of nominal GNP and because of the cumulative impact of
recent sharp interest rate increases. While the timing of such demand
adjustments is always uncertain, our best judgment is that a significant
slowing will begin in August. For July-August combined, a 3-3/4--5-3/4
per cent annual rate of growth for M1 is indicated under alternative B.
","alternative B"
1973-09-18,9,"(9) Alternative A specifications include a 6-month growth rate for
M I of 6 per cent, the rate required to reach the longer-run 5-1/4 per cent path
by March. This pattern is illustrated by the dots labelled ""A"" on the chart.
To compensate for the cumulative restraining impact on money supply of recent
high interest rates, this alternative implies a decline in the Federal funds
rate, with an initial drop over the next few weeks to a level possibly as low
as 8-1/2--9 per cent. Given the lagged relationship between money demand and
interest rates, the longer that shortfalls in monetary aggregates continue, the
sharper the decline in interest rates that would be needed to bring the
aggregates back on path within any specific period. Accordingly, significant
delays in permitting greater reserve availability would increase the risk

that a return to the 5-1/4 per cent path by the end of the first quarter would
require easing to a degree that might lead to a subsequent unduly sharp expansion
in money.
","Alternative A"
1973-10-16,9,"(9) Given the lagged effects on money demand of the interest
rate increases of earlier this year, the staff believes that attainment of the
growth rates for reserves and monetary aggregates specified in alternative B
is likely to involve a further decline in the Federal funds rate over the
near-term. A sharper decline in the funds rate would be likely under A.
Under alternative C, money market conditions seem most likely to remain
around those prevailing recently, given the more restrained growth in
reserves and the aggregates posited.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1973-11-19,9,"(9) Under alternative B, M1 is indicated to expand in November-
December at a 4-1/2-6-1/2 per cent annual rate, given a Federal funds
rate range centered around 10 per cent. RPD growth in this period is
expected to be negative, however, because reserves required to be held
against bank CD's are expected to drop further despite a projected pick-up
in CD issuance later this year.
","alternative B"
1973-12-17,9,"(10) Market interest rates, however, do not appear to have fully
discounted future declines in the funds rate. Thus, an actual drop in the
funds rate, such as would be likely to occur under alternative B, might
trigger sizable further declines in short-term interest rates and also
some decline in long rates. Expectational forces probably would carry market
rates down in the short run by more than is sustainable over the longer run,
however, assuming the funds rate in the early months of next year remained
in the 9 per cent plus range. On balance, over the next few weeks the
funds rate drops to 9-1/2 per cent or somewhat below. This assumes no
substantial central bank sales of Treasury securities as a result of reflows
of dollars from abroad.
","alternative B"
1974-03-18,9,"(9) Following the recent overshoot in M1 growth, both alternatives
B and C are designed to slow M1 growth and restore it to the 5¾ per cent
growth path adopted at previous meetings. Current estimates for M1 in
relation to the long-run growth path are shown in the chart on the following
page. Alternative B aims at a return of M1 to the path by September, whereas
alternative C moves it back more quickly by June (though it then falls
substantially below the path in the third quarter). Alternative A, which
is judged to be consistent with little change in money market conditions,
includes a growth rate for M1 over the next six months that remains above
the 5¾ per cent growth path.

regard to the aggregates adopted by the Committee at its last meeting.
That is, the alternative contemplates return of M1 to the 5¾ per cent long-
run growth path (depicted in the chart on the following page) by September.
Accomplishing this would appear to require interest rates somewhat higher
than indicated at the last meeting, and also higher than those currently
prevailing, in view of the stronger growth in nominal GNP that is now
projected for the second and third quarters. The Federal funds rate range
for the inter-meeting period thought to be consistent with the alternative

1974-07-16,9,"(9) Of the alternatives presented, alternative B represents
continuation of the longer-run target path for M1 adopted at the last
Committee meeting. In that alternative, the annual growth rate for the
second half of 1974 is 5½ per cent. This is slightly above the 5¼ per

on 11¾ per cent, which is close to the rate that has prevailed on
average since the last meeting. Over the two month September-October
period M 1 growth would be expected to be in a 2¾-4¾ per cent, annual
rate, range. The expectation of a continued relatively low growth
rate over the near-term in part reflects the weakness in the fragmentary
information thus far available for the early days of September, a
period when a substantial recovery in growth had earlier been expected.

1974-11-19,9,"(9) Alternative A provides for the greater easing in money
market conditions over the near term that would be needed if the Committee
were to adopt higher longer-run targets for the monetary aggregates,
indexed by a 6½ per cent growth rate for M1 . The funds rate range for
this alternative centers on 8½ per cent. Alternative C provides for the
tightening of money market conditions that would be required if the
Committee were to lower its longer-run target for M 1 to 5 per cent.
","Alternative A, alternative c, Alternative C"
1975-01-20,9,"(9) Interest rate declines under alternative A may begin to be
reversed as spring progresses. The rate of growth in M1 by the second
quarter is expected to be relatively rapid as the impact of monetary
ease cumulates, and growth would tend to accelerate further in the third
quarter, given the substantial jump in the rate of increase in nominal
GNP forecast by the staff, partly because a greater fiscal stimulus is
now assumed, as explained in the green book. Assuming the Committee were to wish
to hold monetary growth to around a 6-7 per cent annual rate in
the second half of the year, this would appear to require an upward
adjustment of the funds rate, as well as other short-term market
interest rates, at a fairly early stage.
","alternative A"
1975-02-19,9,"(9) Of the alternatives shown, alternative A encompasses the
last meeting in its longer-run targets for the first half of '75. This
alternative also shows a 9¾ per cent growth rate for M2, slightly higher
than the rate specified by the Committee last time. The projected
relationship between M 1 and M2 is changed because a further decline in
market interest rates is now assumed to be necessary if the indicated

in larger inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits.

1975-03-18,9,"(9) Of the three alternatives presented, alternative A most
closely approximates the longer-run growth rates that accompanied the
specifications chosen by the Committee at its last meeting. It includes
growth in M1 at a 6 per cent annual rate over the first nine months of the
year. This implies, as is shown, an 8 per cent annual rate of growth over the

rate of growth for M 1 over the period from December 1974 to September
a more rapid 6¾ per cent annual rate to make up for the first quarter
shortfall. M 2 for this alternative shows about the same rate of growth
as at the last meeting, but M3 is somewhat more rapid, reflecting the
greatly enlarged public preference for deposits at thrift institutions
which appears to have emerged.
","alternative B"
1975-07-15,9,"(9) While alternative B calls for maintenance of prevailing
money market conditions in the short-run, given the temporary slowing
expected in M1 growth, it appears likely that money market conditions will
need to be tightened further later on in order to achieve growth in the
aggregates as indexed by expansion in M1 over the next year at around
the center of the 5-7½ per cent range adopted by the Committee at its
last meeting. The staff at this point believes that the funds rate
might need to rise to the neighborhood of 8 per cent by fall, if the
projected 13 per cent annual rate of increase in nominal GNP for the
second half of 1975 materializes. On that assumption we would expect
M1 growth in the second half of 1975 to be at about a 7 per cent annual
rate; a lower growth rate in the first half of 1976 would hence be
required if the Committee's longer-run M1 target is to be achieved.
","alternative B"
1975-08-19,9,"(9) Alternative B--which contemplates a rise in the Federal
funds rate during the intermeeting period to 6-3/4 per cent (the
mid-point of the 6--7-1/2 per cent range presented)--is thought
to be consistent with the first stage of a possible longer-run
strategy that would hold M1 growth within the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per
cent target range--but near the top end of that range. It conforms
with the monetary assumptions underlying the Greenbook economic
projection and is thought likely to imply a Federal funds rate
approaching 9 per cent by early 1976. As noted in the Greenbook, a
rate of money growth in the upper part of the Committee's
long-run target range would help accommodate the special price
effects resulting from decontrol of old oil and the worsening
international outlook for food prices.
","Alternative B"
1975-09-16,9,"(9) Following relatively slow growth in the July-August period,
in September and October M1 is expected to expand at rates more nearly
consistent with the underlying strength of transactions demands. Deposit
expansion in the previous months had been dampened as the public brought
deposit holdings into a more normal relationship with income and interest
rates, following the sharp bulge in late spring resulting from special
Treasury payments. This process now appears to have been completed.
Under alternative A --which assumes the same Federal funds rate range
for the forthcoming intermeeting period as that adopted at the last
meeting--M1 is expected to rise at an annual rate in the 6½-3½ per cent
area over this and the next month on average. M2 growth is also likely
to accelerate, mainly reflecting the more rapid expansion on demand deposits.

However, growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits also is
expected to strengthen a little, at least temporarily, from its reduced
August rate.
","alternative A"
1975-12-16,9,"(9) The basic outlook over the longer run for monetary aggregates and
interest rates appears little changed from the previous blue book. Under
alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be expected to begin rising by
around mid-winter and may reach the 7-7½ per cent range by summer, which would
be a shade less than projected last time. Growth in time deposits other than
large CD's is expected to moderate progressively over the first half of next
year. We have assumed that shifts of funds from demand deposits into corporate
savings accounts will become negligible by late winter, but this assumption
is subject to considerable uncertainty because of the novelty of the development.
","alternative B"
1976-01-20,9,"(9) Alternative A encompasses higher growth rates for the monetary
aggregates over the next year than alternative B, while alternative C
presents lower rates. The alternative A rates may be viewed as compensating,
in an arithmetic sense, for the shortfall in M1 growth relative to expecta-
tions in the fourth quarter. That is to say, under alternative A the
level of M1 in the third quarter 1976(using mid-points of the ranges) would
be the same as that implied by a 6¼ per cent growth rate measured from the
third quarter of 1975. To reach that level, M 1 would have to expand at
almost a 7½ per cent annual rate over the first three quarters of 1976.
","Alternative A, alternative B, alternative C, alternative A, alternative A"
1976-02-17,9,"(9) Even if M1 growth in February-March is as rapid as implied
by the mid-point of the range stipulated for alternative B, M1 would
expand at only about a 3¼ per cent annual rate from the fourth quarter of
of about 12 per cent annual rate, another sizable rise in velocity appears
in store--as would be consistent with a further downward shift in the demand
for money. The staff is assuming only a small further downward shift after
the first quarter, and as a result interest rates can be expected to begin
rising in the spring if M1 growth is to be kept to around a 6 per cent rate
over the year. The funds rate under alternative B is expected to reach
an average level of around 6¾ per cent by the fourth quarter of this year.
Rate pressures would, of course, be stronger if the demand for money began
strengthening relative to GNP. Appendix Table IV shows Federal funds rates
expected over the course of the year for each of the alternatives.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1976-03-15,9,"(9) The staff continues to believe that interest rates will
have to rise later in the year--perhaps beginning in late spring--if a
Under alternative B, we have assumed that the Federal funds rate will
average about 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976 .1/ This represents
somewhat less upward rate pressure than assumed in the previous blue
book, and reflects the need for a little more expansion in M1 over the
last three quarters of the year to make up for the fact that growth in
the first quarter of 1976 is now expected to be somewhat slower than
anticipated a month ago. Under these assumptions, M2 growth over the
period from QIV '75 to QIV '76 would be about 9¾ per cent--somewhat above
the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range.
","alternative B"
1976-04-20,9,"(9) M1 growth has been generally strengthening in recent months.
Part of the expansion in recent weeks may be attributable to declining
Treasury deposits, but on balance it seems likely that a somewhat more
typical relationship between M1 and GNP is being re-established. We would
expect M1 to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate from the first to second
quarter. The staff expects that interest rates will soon have to begin
rising if growth over the one-year QI '76-QI '77 period is to be constrained
to 6 per cent--the mid-point of the longer-run growth range of alternative B.
Our projected Federal funds rate patterns through the first quarter of 1977
for all alternatives are shown in appendix table IV. Under alternative B,
the funds rate is expected to reach the 7 per cent level by early next
","alternative B, alternative B"
1976-05-18,9,"(9) Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range centered
on 5-1/4 per cent, the most recent Desk objective, while alternative A
assumes some easing of the money market and alternative C some further
tightening. Under all three alternatives, the rate of growth in M1 over
the May-June period is expected to be considerably reduced from its April
pace, though remaining stronger than in the latter part of 1975 and early
per cent annual rate range.
","Alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1976-06-22,9,"(9) Given the prevailing Federal funds rate, time deposits
other than large money market CD's are expected to grow over the next two
months at an annual rate around 10 per cent. With short-term market rates
generally above the 5 per cent passbook rate, interest-sensitive holders,
including businesses and state and local governments, may continue to
reduce holdings of savings deposits. However, this may be offset by further
expansion of ceiling-free time certificates of deposit, including large-
denomination certificates issued by non-money market banks. Thus, for
the June-July period, M2 growth may be in a 6½-10½ per cent annual rate
range under alternative B.
","alternative B"
1976-07-19,9,"(9) Alternatives A and C call for longer-run M1 ranges one
percentage point higher and lower, respectively, than that shown under
alternative B. Alternative C would compensate for the second-quarter
overshoot in M 1 , in that M1 would be expected to reach roughly the same
level in the first quarter of 1977 as that implied by a 5¾ per cent growth
rate measured from the first quarter of 1976. To reach this level, M1
would have to expand at about a 4¾ per cent annual rate over the three
quarters ending with the first quarter of 1977.
","alternative B, Alternative C"
1976-08-17,9,"(9) The intermeeting range for the Federal funds rate under
alternative B is centered on 5¾ per cent, the rate recently prevailing.
Given the projected increase in nominal GNP at about an 11 per cent annual
rate on average over the next few quarters, the staff still expects that
interest rates will begin rising fairly soon if longer-run M1 growth is
held to around a 5¾ per cent annual rate. By the second quarter of 1977,
we would expect the funds rate to average around 7¼ per cent.
","alternative B"
1976-10-19,9,"(9) Under the circumstances, the three lettered alternatives
incorporate a different relationship between M1 and the broader aggre-
gates han is contained in the set of longer-run ranges currently in
place. Under alternative C, the growth ranges for the broader monetary
aggregates are about the same as those that now prevail, but the range
for M1 is lower. Alternative B continues the current growth range for
M1, but involves somewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3 . Alternative A--
which contemplates little change in interest rates over the next year--
contains higher ranges for all of the monetary aggregates.1/
","alternative C, Alternative B, Alternative A"
1976-11-16,9,"(9) Alternative B involves maintenance of the Federal funds
rate at around 5 per cent over the next few weeks. We have also assumed
that credit and money demands would not begin to exert significant
upward pressures on the rate until around the middle of the first quarter
of 1977. Moreover, because alternative B--in contrast to alternative A--
does not involve any additional stimulation over the near term, not as
much monetary restraint would be required in the spring and summer of
next year to attain a one-year growth rate of 5½ per cent in M1. As a
result, the funds rate would rise less than under alternative A.
","Alternative B, alternative B, alternative A, alternative A"
1977-02-15,9,"(9) M1 and M2 under alternative B may be expected to rise at
annual rates of about 5½ and 10 per cent, respectively, in the first
quarter. Growth in these aggregates, especially M1, is likely to
strengthen in the second quarter, as a result of the temporary impact
of tax rebates. M1 growth in the second quarter would be further augmented
by increased money demands associated with the rapid expansion in nominal GNP
projected for the spring as the fuel shortage subsides.
","alternative B"
1977-04-19,9,"(9) Under alternative B (as well as the other two alternatives),
growth in M1 is expected to be relatively sizable in the April-May period,
reflecting the large increase in M1 that is apparently under way in April.
We expect the exceptionally large April growth to be partly offset by
relatively small growth rates in May and June. However, for the second
quarter, M1 is anticipated to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate, a
more rapid pace than in the past few quarters, reflecting the recent
strengthening of economic activity and presumably also of transactions
demands for money.
","alternative B"
1977-05-17,9,"(9) Under alternative B, we would expect M2 to expand in
a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range in the May-June period. The time
and savings deposit component of M 2 is expected to expand somewhat

more rapidly over the weeks ahead than during the recent past.
In the course of April, growth in consumer-type time and savings
deposits appears to have been restrained by relatively large nonwith-
held tax payments by individuals. Still, growth in the weeks ahead
is likely to be slower than the pace during the first quarter in view
of the higher level of short- and intermediate-term market rates now
","alternative B"
1977-07-19,9,"(9) Under alternative B, the one year growth ranges for M-1
and M-2 are the same as those adopted by the Committee in April. The growth
range for M-3, however, is lower by ½ percentage point. This lower M-3
range now appears more consistent with the ranges shown for M-1 and M-2,
given the staff's current projection of deposit flows at thrift institu-
tions over the next four quarters. Alternative A encompasses a little more
rapid growth in all of the monetary aggregates than B, and alternative C
a little slower growth. The differences among these alternatives are in
line with the size of changes in longer-run ranges that the Committee has
actually made in its quarterly reviews of the one-year ranges. The specifi-
cations of alternative D, however, involve a larger adjustment in the
ranges, with the midpoint of the growth range for M-1 reduced to 4¾ per
cent over the QII '77-QII '78 period. This alternative would compensate
for the second quarter overshoot in growth of M-1; that is, it would result
in expansion of M-1 over the five quarters, QI '77-QII '78, at a 5½ per
cent annual rate--the midpoint of the M-1 range adopted by the Committee
in April for the QI '77-QI '78 period.1/ M-2 growth over the five quarter
period under this alternative would be at about an 8 per cent annual rate,
however, a shade below the midpoint of the current M-2 range.
","alternative B, Alternative A, alternative C"
1977-08-16,9,"(9) A marked slowing in growth of M-1 is anticipated for
the August-September period, as the extremely rapid expansion in M-1
in July probably provided the public with enough cash to accommodate
the bulk of third-quarter transactions needs. Under alternative B,
M-1 is expected to expand in a 2-6 per cent, annual rate, range. Such
an expansion would produce an 8¾ per cent annual rate of growth from the
second to the third quarter, as compared with a 12 per cent annual rate
of growth in nominal GNP projected for that period.
","alternative B"
1977-09-20,9,"(9) Under alternative B, in the September-October period M-2
is expected to expand in a 5½-9½ per cent annual rate range, assuming
that short-term market interest rates show little change from currently
prevailing levels in the period between now and the next meeting. Net
inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's are
expected to be relatively low in September, but to pick up to a pace
more consonant with existing interest rate relationships later in the
fall. Some of the recent weakness in the time deposit component of M-2
appears to have reflected shifts of funds from maturing ""wild card"" certi-
ficates at banks to higher rate certificates at thrift institutions.
Indeed, at nonbank thrift institutions deposit inflows expanded sharply
over the summer, as these institutions became more aggressive in seeking
deposit funds in view of their large mortgage commitments and in light
of uncertainties about their own substantial ""wild card"" maturities.
","alternative B"
1978-02-28,9,"(10) The table below provides perspective on the relation-
ship among growth rates proposed for the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period
and the implied growth rates for more extended periods ending in
to a 5.6 per cent annual rate of expansion over the 15-month period
starting with QIII '77 and to a 6.3 per cent annual rate of growth
over the 18-month period beginning with QII '77--in both cases within
the current FOMC range but above the mid-point. The higher growth
rates over these longer periods reflect the sizable overshoot in
M-1 growth in the third quarter of last year and the more moderate
overshoot in the fourth quarter. M-1 growth at around the 5 per cent
mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would nearly compensate
for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third
quarter overshoot.

","alternative C"
1978-03-21,9,"(9) Against this background, M-1 growth is expected to
accelerate in the weeks ahead. Given the Federal funds rate assump-
tion of alternative B--with the rate centered at the 6¾ per cent
level prevailing since early January--M-1 growth over March-April
is likely to be in a 4 to 9 per cent annual rate range.
","alternative B"
1978-04-18,9,"(9) All of the alternatives imply relatively rapid increases
in the income velocity of M-1, and also a rise in the income velocity
of M-2, as shown in Appendix II. Assuming M-1 growth at the 5¼ per
cent mid-point of the alternative B range, V-1 would be projected
to rise by about 7 per cent over the coming four quarters, more than
twice the average rate of the past two years. The projected rise in
interest rates would tend to increase the public's willingness to
economize on cash balances and thus would contribute to an accelera-
tion in velocity growth. However, the staff has assumed that there
also will be a further downward shift in the demand for money over the
period ahead, partly because higher market interest rates may once
again lead to new financial innovations that substitute for demand
deposits, and to more intensive marketing of earlier innovations
and cash management services, as financial institutions
attempt to retain funds. Whether such a further downward shift
in demand for M-1 will actually occur is quite uncertain, however.
If it does not, efforts to constrain growth in M-1 to the mid-point
of the ranges presented are likely to involve interest rate levels
higher than those projected, and consequent growth in real GNP
below the projected rate.
","alternative B"
1978-06-20,9,"(9) Expansion in M-2 under Alternative A is also likely to
be in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range over the June-July period.
Growth at the mid-point of this range would maintain M-2 near the
upper end of the longer-run range adopted by the Committee for this
aggregate, as shown in Chart 2.
","Alternative A"
1978-07-18,9,"(9) Even with the assumption that M-1 grows near the
upper end of its ranges, the GNP projection implies relatively
rapid increases in the velocity of M-1. Under alternative B, V-1
is projected to rise by 4½ per cent over the QII '78-QII '79 period,1/
as compared with an increase of 3¼ per cent over the preceding four
quarters. Efforts by the public to economize on cash as interest
rates rise would contribute to an increase in velocity, but--given
the interest rates assumed--the 4 per cent rise that is projected
also presupposes a further modest downward shift in the demand
for money. Such a shift could develop as higher interest rates
induce more intensive marketing of earlier innovations and cash
management services. Over recent quarters, however, the demand
for money has been about as strong as would be expected from historical
relationships. If that tendency continues, efforts to constrain
M-1 to the upper end of the ranges presented will require higher
interest rates and/or lower GNP growth than projected.
","alternative B"
1978-08-15,9,"(9) M-2 in the August-September period under alternative A
is expected to grow in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range. The
interest-bearing component of M-2 may expand at about a 10 per cent
annual rate over the period. This represents a slight slowing from
the July rate of growth, but is more rapid than in the first half of
the year. With inflows of deposits subject to ceiling rates remaining
sluggish, banks are expected to sell substantial amounts of large
time deposits--both non-negotiable and negotiable--to finance continued
relatively strong credit demands.
","alternative A"
1978-11-21,9,"(9) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate
between now and the next meeting centered in the prevailing 9½ to 9¾
per cent range. Growth in M-1 over the November-December period is
expected to be in a 1 to 6 per cent annual rate range--assuming that
transfers to savings deposits because of ATS will reduce M-1 growth
over these two months by 3 to 5 percentage points. Some acceleration
in M-1 growth is anticipated in December. The relatively slow growth
of October-November in part represented the public's adjustment to
the very rapid expansion in money that occurred in September. In
December, we expect the relatively strong underlying demand for money

Thus, we have projected some strengthening of M-1 growth for the policy
period immediately ahead. Under alternative B, with the funds rate
remaining at the prevailing level of about 10 per cent, we expect M-1
to increase over the April-May period in a 3 to 7 per cent annual rate
range. For the second quarter as a whole, staff projections call for M-1
expansion under alternative B at about a 3¼ per cent annual rate, following
the 2½ per cent rate of decline in the first quarter. With nominal GNP
expected to expand at an 11 per cent annual rate, the implied growth of
V-1 in the second quarter, as shown in the Appendix, would be around a 7½

annual rate, following a 1 percent decline in the second quarter.1/ Because of
the lags that ordinarily characterize the public's adjustment of its cash

have been expected in light of the sharp deceleration of nominal GNP growth

in the second quarter, and is expected to have about ¾ percentage point
impact in the current quarter. Quarterly velocity figures are shown in

in the spring. However, the continued strength of M-1 suggests the
possibility of a precautionary accumulation of liquid balances in
response to unusual economic uncertainties. Such a pattern would not
be expected to persist for an extended period, and the staff anticipates
a return to somewhat weaker demands for M-1 over the remainder of the
year--although not to the marked weakness observed in the past fall and

growth is projected over the balance of the year. The expected deceleration
reflects the lagged effects of the tightening of money market conditions this
summer and the reduction in transactions demand for money associated with the
projected slowing of nominal GNP growth in the months ahead.
","alternative B"
1980-03-18,9,"(9) The staff expects that under alternative B M-2 for the
December-June period would grow around 7¾ percent and by 7 percent from
February to June. This is faster than would be implied by a simple extension
of the 6 percent rate targeted for the December to March period. However,
The specified growth for February-June represents a significant slowing
from the February pace, and as shown in chart 2, such growth would place
M-2 in June at the midpoint of its longer-run range.

","alternative B"
1980-09-16,9,"(9) Monetary growth rates for the final four months of the
year proposed under these alternatives represent a substantial decelera-
tion from the summer pace. A considerable slowing in money growth appears
in train for September, a not unusual development after a month of
exceptionally rapid increase, reinforced by the lagged effect on money demand
of the considerable rise in short-term interest rates that has occurred since
June. However, money demand is expected to be relatively strong over
the last three months of the year, as transactions needs rise in reflection
of the 11 percent annual rate of increase projected for nominal GNP. Under
these circumstances, to restrain money growth between now and year-end to
the pace specified by either alternative A or B would appear to imply a
further rise of interest rates--with the rise under alternative B larger
and occurring sooner.

","alternative A, alternative B"
1980-10-21,9,"(9) The relationships of the September-to-December targets to
the Committee's longer-run ranges are depicted in the charts on the following
pages. Under alternative A, M-1A growth would be somewhat below the mid-
point of its longer-run range, but the staff believes that in the fourth
quarter M-1B would be at, and M-2 slightly above, their respective longer-
run upper bounds. Under alternative B, both M-1B and M-2 would exceed their
longer-run upper bounds, though differences from the one-year growth rates
implied by alternative A are slight because of the short time period
remaining in the year. Under both alternatives, M-3 is expected to be a
shade below the upper end of its longer-run range.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1980-11-18,9,"(9) Alternative B continues the Committee's current targets for
the fourth quarter, as indexed by M-1A and M-1B. Given what has already
occurred in October, to achieve these targets M-1A would have to contract
over the remaining weeks of the year. The staff still believes that a
significant slowing in the growth of transactions balances is likely, partly
because of the sharp run-up in interest rates of the last three months and
partly on the assumption that the recent very rapid month-to-month growth
in economic activity slows significantly. However, achieving the negative
growth in M-1A over the balance of the year implied by alternative B would
probably require further near-term increases in short-term interest rates.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1981-05-18,9,"(9) Given the sharp rise of M-1B in April the Committee may
wish to consider alternatives that in effect avoid squeezing out all of
the excess April growth over the balance of the quarter. Alternative A
targets M-1B growth in May and June at the 4¾ percent midpoint of its
longer-run range, a rate of growth that would keep the level of M-1B
just below its midpoint by June. Alternative B calls for a growth rate
of 3 percent over the two months, which would bring the level of M-1B well
into the lower half of its range by June.

1981-10-05,9,"(9) Alternative A is designed to achieve a rapid enough expansion
of M1-B over the next three months so that it would reach the lower limit
of the FOMC's 3½ to 6 percent longer-run target range by December. This
approach would probably lead to growth in M2 (and also M3) for the year
well above target. Alternative C is designed to bring M2 closer to its
target for the year, with the projected small overshoot accounted for mainly
by shifts of funds out of non-M2 assets into ASCs; such an approach would

foreign IPC demand deposits are shifted to 2-day notice accounts in
IBFs. Such shifts are expected to be small, however; they may have
some impact on annual growth rates for the month of December, but
would probably have no significant effect on growth for the year.

rate over the next few weeks to the 9 to 10 percent area. Under such
conditions other short-term interest rates would of course also decline
substantially, with the 3-month bill rate perhaps falling to around the 9
percent area. Such declines would occur against a back-drop of continued
sizable Treasury cash borrowings over the balance of the year ($13 billion
in the bill market and $6 billion in the coupon market) but reduced short-
term credit demands by businesses, as their financing gap narrows, largely
in reflection of reduced inventory accumulation, and as credit demands
are shifted to longer-term markets.
","Alternative A"
1982-05-18,9,"(9) Under alternative B, we would expect some further downward
drift in short-term rates between now and mid-year. The transactions
demand for money is expected to be more moderate than anticipated at the
time of the last meeting, with projected growth in nominal GNP in the
second quarter revised down to only a 6½ percent annual rate. In addi-
tion, we would anticipate the relatively strong precautionary demands
of early this year and late 1981 to begin to moderate as economic prospects

Alternative C would achieve the upper limit of the Committee's 2-1/2 to

would be just a bit above the upper end of the range by June, and
would be down within the range under alternatives B and C, as shown in
Chart 1. Under all three alternatives M3 would be at the top of, or
within, its longer-run range, but M1, though its growth is expected to

in the broader aggregates. However, in all cases, expected M1 growth is
lower than the Committee's current short-run specifications, given the
unexpectedly slow growth of this aggregate in October. Under all of the
alternatives, the monetary aggregates would be expected to remain comfort-
ably within their longer-run ranges for 1983, with M1 and M2 in the lower
halves of their respective ranges and M3 in the upper part of its range;

growth rates from longer-run bases to the fourth quarter under each

","Alternative B, alternative a"
1984-03-26,9,"(9) The specifications of alternative B, which are those
considered most consistent with the staff's GNP outlook, call for some
slowing of M1 growth from the pace of the December-to-March period,
although this aggregate would remain above the midpoint of its longer-
run range in June. Growth of M2 would be expected to accelerate, how-
ever, placing this aggregate near the middle of its range by mid-year,
while M3 growth would continue near the upper end of its range. Given
the continuing strength of money and credit demands implicit in the
these specifications may involve some further firming of interest rates
over the intermeeting period and a relatively strong rise in velocity.
M1 velocity in the second quarter would probably expand at about a

to what is typical in the second year of a recovery. While M1 would
still be well in the upper part of its range by June, its expansion
would be expected to moderate further toward the middle of the range
over the second half of the year partly in lagged response to further
interest rate increases and also reflecting a slowdown in GNP growth.
","alternative B"
1984-10-02,9,"(10) Alternative B, and the other alternatives as well, also
call for somewhat more rapid growth of M2 over the September-to-December
period than in the summer. Spurred by faster income growth and a more
favorable alignment of rates on deposits relative to rates on market
instruments, the nontransactions component, along with M1, is expected to
contribute to the pickup in M2 expansion in the fourth quarter. M3
growth also is expected to quicken. Despite slower credit expansion at
thrifts projected for the fourth quarter, the recent weakness in thrift
CDs and associated rapid rise in FHLB advances is unlikely to continue,
assuming the condition of FCA stabilizes and repercussions on the access
of other thrifts to wholesale money markets remain minor. Commercial
bank CD issuance is likely to pick up as Treasury deposits decline.
","Alternative B"
1984-12-17,9,"(9) The aggregates specifications of alternative B, which are
expected to be consistent with maintenance of about the current degree of
pressure on reserve positions, would place all of the money supply measures
in March close to the upper limits of their tentative longer-run ranges
for 1985 established last July. Growth of M1 under this alternative from
November to March would be expected to be at about a 6-3/4 percent annual
rate. The acceleration of M1 growth from the slower pace that has pre-
vailed on average since around mid-year reflects strengthened transactions
demands, given the projected pickup in GNP growth, as well as the lagged
effects of the sizable drop in short-term rates over recent months. The
income velocity of M1 would be about unchanged in the first quarter.
Some models, on the other hand, suggest a drop in income velocity, associ-
ated with higher money growth at current interest rates, because they
embody greater responsiveness of M1 to earlier interest rate declines.

We have assumed, however, a more moderate M1 growth partly because its
recent behavior suggests the possibility that the demand for narrow money
may have become a little less responsive to interest rate changes.
","alternative B"
1985-05-21,9,"(9) The decline in interest rates over the past several weeks
will be tending to boost money demand in May and June, and M1 under this
alternative is expected to increase at a 6-1/2 percent rate over the
March-to-June period, despite some weakening in projected nominal GNP
growth for the second quarter. On a quarterly-average basis, M1 would
increase at a 7-1/4 percent rate in the second quarter, which implies a
second consecutive quarterly decline in velocity, although at a somewhat
slower rate than in the first quarter; such a decline is roughly consistent
with model results. By June, M1 under alternative B would be about
$1-3/4 billion (or 0.3 percent) above the upper parallel line of the
band drawn from the fourth quarter end points of the 4 to 7 percent range
for 1985, with growth from QIV '84 to June at around an 8-1/2 percent
annual rate.
","alternative B"
1985-11-04,9,"(9) Alternative B contemplates maintenance of about the current
degree of pressure on reserve positions, indexed by discount window borrow-
ing of $450 to $550 million, with federal funds continuing to trade around
roughly a 4 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year. M1
under these conditions would probably increase at about an 8 percent annual
rate over November and December, bringing growth over the last three months
of the year to 5 percent and growth from the second quarter through December
to 11 percent.1 Demand deposits are projected to increase only slightly on
balance over the remainder of the year, while NOW account growth should
remain below the unusually rapid advance of the summer. On a quarterly
average basis, M1 would increase at a 7-1/4 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter. Given the greenbook GNP forecast, this implies a further
drop in velocity, though at only about a one percent annual rate. This
behavior of velocity would still be a bit weaker than predicted by most
models of money demand, although the disparity would be considerably narrower
than in the third quarter.
","Alternative B"
1985-12-16,9,"(9) Growth of M1 is expected to slow in the early months of next
year under all of the alternatives, following rapid expansion in December,
with growth decelerating to around 6 to 7 percent under alternative B.
Relationships in the first quarter among M1, interest rates, and income are
more than usually difficult to predict, however, largely because of uncer-
tainties about when the unusual weakness of M1 velocity in recent quarters
will wane or be reversed. In addition, the minimum balance requirements on
super NOW accounts and MMDAs will be eliminated on January 1. Given the
already advanced state of deposit deregulation, and present indications
that depository institutions intend to take a conservative approach to
setting rates and terms on super NOW and MMDA accounts, the staff does not
expect this deregulatory step to have any appreciable immediate impact on
Ml. All things considered, the velocity of M1 would be expected to decline
further in the first quarter under all three alternatives, given the green-
book GNP forecast, but this is largely attributable to the boost to quarterly
average growth from the recent rapid expansion of M1. The more restrained
growth in M1 over the December-to-March period implied by the alternatives
is roughly consistent with the results of available money demand models,
and presumes an abatement of outsized inflows into demand deposits and NOW
accounts but no reversal of the recent bulge.
","alternative B"
1986-04-01,9,"(9) With reserve conditions unchanged under alternative B,
federal funds would be expected generally to trade in the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8
percent area. Other interest rates may change little, although some reversal
of recent declines cannot be ruled out, and on foreign exchange markets the
dollar may remain around current levels for a time. To some degree, a
further easing in monetary policy over coming months may be built into the

existing interest rate structure. Thus, should the market come to view
such an easing as unlikely, the 3-month bill rate could back up into the
as well, though they are likely to continue to be influenced importantly by
movements in oil prices. On the supply side of the bond market, offerings
are expected to remain relatively heavy. Though corporate issuance may
ease back from recent record levels reached in response to the decline in
rates so far this year, Treasury bond issuance will pick up now that the
Congressional ceiling on high coupon bonds has been lifted.
","alternative B"
1986-05-20,9,"(9) M2 growth under alternative B also would slow over the rest
of the second quarter--though still recording a much faster advance than
during the first three months of the year. Inflows to liquid retail accounts,
while remaining sizable, would moderate compared with April and early May as
yields on MMDAs and MMMFs move into closer alignment with market rates. As
growth of core deposits ebbs, banks should resume issuance of large CDs to
help finance some pickup in bank credit growth from its recent depressed
pace, and thus M3 is expected to slow relatively little in June.
","alternative B"
1986-08-19,9,"(9) Alternative B assumes adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at
the discount window averaging around $300 million (abstracting from any

special situation credit). Federal funds would probably continue to trade
in the 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 percent area. M2 growth would be expected to slow to
around 8 percent over August and September, reflecting in large measure a
leveling off in overnight RPs as banks stop adding aggressively to their
holdings of U.S. government securities in a more stable interest rate environ-
ment. In addition, growth of retail deposits and money market funds is likely
to moderate as offering yields come more in line with market rates around cur-
rent levels. Fragmentary data for early August suggest that expansion of M2
is indeed slowing from its rapid July pace. Even with the anticipated moder-
ation in M2, growth would average 9-1/2 percent fran June to September and
an unusually large drop in its velocity (given the greenbook forecast for
GNP) of 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate. The projected moderation in M3
growth from its July bulge reflects less rapid expansion in its non-M2 compon-
ent as well as in M2. Inflows to institution-only money funds should abate
in response to the realignment of fund yields with market rates, and the
expected deceleration in bank credit would act to reduce issuance of managed

1986-09-23,9,"(9) Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be
constructed assuming $300 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at
the discount window. Federal funds would be expected to continue to trade
around 5-7/8 percent, confirming expectations of no near-term policy change,
and the Treasury bill rate would remain near 5-1/4 percent. Bond yields
should fluctuate around recent higher levels, with financial markets continuing
to be unusually sensitive to developments affecting the economic and policy
outlook. While forthcoming inflation indicators may suggest only a moderate
uptick in price pressures, as in the staff forecast, strength in near-term
data on economic activity, expansion of broad money measures along the upper
bounds of their ranges, and the continued downtrend in the dollar in foreign
exchange markets expected under this alternative would tend to limit the
potential for retracing the recent climb in bond yields.

the discount window around $300 million. Federal funds are likely to re-
main near 5-7/8 percent and the Treasury bill rate in the vicinity of 5-1/4
percent. Bond yields also would be expected to fluctuate around current
levels. These rates might be especially sensitive to changing perceptions
of foreign demands for U.S. securities and accompanying movements in the
dollar on foreign exchange markets through the upcoming period of auction
and distribution of the Treasury's mid-quarter refunding issues. And
credit market participants are likely to be watching developments in the
oil market particularly closely, given the uncertainty about future price
movements. Mortgage rates might continue to edge down relative to Treasury
bond yields as concerns about accelerated repayments ebb further in a
relatively stable interest rate environment. The dollar is expected to
drift lower, retracing its recent gains, in light of the continuing large
U.S. current account deficit.
","Alternative B"
1986-12-15,9,"(9) M2, under alternative B, is expected to slow further from
its average growth over October and November, expanding at a 7 percent pace
over the November-to-March period--in the middle of its tentative range.
The boost to M2 growth from previous market rate declines is likely to
diminish further over this period, reinforced by additional reductions in
offering rates on passbook accounts and other liquid deposits. The degree
of moderation, though, probably will be limited by a continuation of slow
adjustment of offering rates on these accounts. In addition, nominal in-
come growth is projected to pick up in the first quarter, bolstering demands
for M2. Adding to uncertainty about M2 growth in 1987 are tighter restric-
tions on IRA deductions imposed by tax reform, which will tend to reduce the
appeal of this non-M2 investment. While this could act to boost inflows to
M2 accounts over time, its effects are less certain early in the year, when
flows are dominated by contributions for the previous tax year. 1 Under
alternative B, M2 would outpace nominal GNP, given the staff forecast, and
its velocity thus would decline further in the first quarter, though by
considerably less than in the fourth quarter or the year 1986.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1987-03-31,9,"(9) Alternative B assumes maintenance of the current degree of
pressure on reserve positions, with reserve paths allowing for $300 million
of borrowing at the discount window. Federal funds would be expected to
trade around 6 percent or a touch above. The Treasury bill rate is expected
to remain around current levels or perhaps move lower in response to a
further reduction in supply; although the Treasury is likely to sell cash
management bills in coming days, they would mature shortly after the April
tax date, and net redemptions of bills at regular weekly auctions are expected

to continue for a time. Little net movement in long-term rates is antici-
pated under this alternative, consistent with staff expectations of moderate
economic expansion and limited inflationary pressures. The dollar might
remain under some downward pressure, but the decline in exchange rates
through the spring is expected to be moderate assuming continuing efforts
to stabilize rates under the Paris agreement. Sustained weakness in the
dollar could tend to push up interest rates in U.S. markets owing to con-
cerns about monetary policy responses and the strength of overall demand
for dollar assets.
","Alternative B"
1987-05-19,9,"(9) The slight drop in money market rates expected under this
alternative may not be accompanied by an improvement in bond yields. Longer-
term markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to the behavior of the
dollar on foreign exchange markets and indications of emerging price pressures
in the United States. While increases in some price measures should moderate
a bit from the elevated rate of earlier months, they are expected to remain
considerably in excess of the pace of last year. Moreover, the staff expects
the dollar to remain under downward pressure with alternative B, in light of
slow progress in the adjustment of nominal external imbalances, arising in
part from weak growth in our major trading partners. Under these conditions,
markets are likely to continue to anticipate a firming in monetary policy
before very long.
","alternative B"
1987-08-18,9,"(9) Alternative B is based on retaining $500 million of adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing as the assumption in constructing reserve paths.
Federal funds would be likely to trade mainly in the lower portion of a
rate tax date, when unusually large payments may impart some temporary upward
pressure to the funds rate. With no major changes in supply anticipated, at
least until the time of the next expiration of the Treasury debt ceiling on
September 23, Treasury bill rates now seem broadly consistent with a federal
funds rate continuing to average a little above 6-1/2 percent. Likewise,
other money market rates generally should vary around current levels under
alternative B. Longer-term rates also are most likely to fluctuate near

to developments in the Persian Gulf and other factors bearing on the
inflation outlook and the dollar.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1987-09-22,9,"(9) Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be drawn
with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the $600 million level that has
been specified since early September. Money markets do not yet appear to
reflect this higher level of borrowing, and the federal funds rate would be
expected to firm a little, into a 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent range, as borrowing
came to average around $600 million and the market perceived the Federal
Reserve's intentions. The three-month Treasury bill rate would climb by

about 1/4 percentage point toward 6-3/4 percent, consistent with the slight
firming of the federal funds rate and an unwinding of distortions associated
with potential debt-ceiling disruptions. Private short-term rates also would
rise, but by even smaller amounts. In light of the higher federal funds rate
compared with its level expected at the last FOMC meeting, the federal funds
range associated with alternative B, given in the last line of the table, is
suggested at 5 to 9 percent; this would be 1 percentage point above the range
now in the directive, and more nearly centered on the federal funds rates
thought likely to prevail under this alternative.

1987-12-15,9,"(9) Alternative B would involve federal funds trading continuing
to center around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent. Borrowing at the discount

window associated with this level of federal funds trading seems espe-
cially difficult to gauge for the coming two maintenance periods, which
surround year-end, as depository institutions position themselves for
anticipated year-end pressures. Given continuing uncertainties in
financial markets and concerns about bank credit quality, some reluc-
tance on the part of banks to be seen at the window is likely to persist
after year-end. Borrowing of perhaps around $300 million could be
consistent with the assumed federal funds rate in the new year.
","Alternative B"
1988-05-17,9,"(9) Market interest rates now appear to incorporate the policy
stance of alternative B. Thus, with federal funds continuing to trade
around 7 percent, the three-month Treasury bill rate could remain in the

greenbook forecast, heightened market concern about inflation and anticipa-
tion of further policy restraint could well induce a further firming in
short- and long-term rates as midyear approaches. Pressures on the dollar
will depend not only on incoming information about the trade deficit and on
movements in relative interest rates, but also on market views of how macro-
economic developments and policies are affecting the sustainability of
improvements in external imbalances. A substantial firming of monetary
policies abroad in the wake of recent Federal Reserve action, or emerging

market perceptions over coming weeks of a need for more U.S. policy
restraint in the face of the maintenance of the reserve conditions of alter-
native B, could result in a decline in the dollar.
","alternative B"
1988-08-16,9,"(9) Financial markets in recent days have largely built in a
federal funds rate of around 8-1/8 percent, although some further adjust-
ments may occur under alternative B. For example, the 3-month Treasury
bill rate might edge higher to around 7-1/8 percent as some of the remain-
ing uncertainties about any further responses of capital markets in the
U.S. and financial markets and policies abroad are resolved. Bond yields
should remain around current levels, especially if the dollar, as expected,
continues fairly firm. The dollar could come under downward pressure,
however, and bond yields resume their rise, if incoming data suggested that
the pace of international adjustment was proceeding considerably less

rapidly than previous trade reports had suggested, other data were seen as
portending greater odds of inflation pressures, or foreign monetary author-
ities tightened aggressively. In any case, the long-term Treasury bond
yield would tend to move higher, perhaps by 10 to 20 basis points, if the
Treasury receives authority to issue more of such securities.
","alternative B"
1988-12-13,9,"(9) The money growth paths from November to March associated
with each alternative are presented in the table below. Under both
alternatives, M2 growth over coming months would be relatively restrained,
reflecting recent and, under alternative C, prospective increases in mar-
ket interest rates. As a consequence, this aggregate in March would be in
the lower portion of its tentative 3 to 7 percent range for 1989. M3
through March would be above the midpoint of its tentative 3-1/2 to 7-1/2
percent range under either alternative, boosted by the expected surge in
managed liabilities at banks to fund lending associated with mergers and

1989-05-16,9,"(9) M2 under all the alternatives embodies some impetus from the
decline in market rates over the intermeeting period, as well as a common
catch-up factor. In addition, any effect that thrift deposit outflows
might have had on M2 growth earlier in the year is likely to be even
smaller, as such outflows continue to abate. Nevertheless, owing to the
impact of tax payments in late April and early May, M2 is projected to
decline in May, before growing in June. As a consequence, this aggregate
through June should remain below the 3 percent lower bound of its target
cone, even under the reduced interest rates of alternative A. However, if
money market conditions of either alternative A or B were maintained
through the summer, the waning effects of earlier increases in market
interest rates, reinforced by the delayed upward adjustment of liquid
deposit rates, likely would bring M2 within its annual range by the end of
the third quarter, assuming spending and income growth close to the green-
book projections. M1 also is expected to strengthen, though given its
adverse opportunity costs, this aggregate would only level out in June
under B, and under all three alternatives would remain substantially below
its March level. The velocity of M2 would be expected to increase between
a 5 and 6 percent rate in the second quarter under the three alternatives;
this is substantially faster than would be predicted from our models of
money demand, given the interest rates of the three alternatives and
greenbook GNP, reflecting in part the depressing effect of the tax-related
drawdown on quarterly average M2.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1989-08-22,9,"(9) Markets still seem to expect a slight easing of policy over
the months ahead. The stability of the funds rate around the current
level under alternative B, especially if combined with incoming economic
data in line with the greenbook forecast of sustained economic growth,
would raise further doubts in securities markets about the likelihood of
such an easing. The alteration of market perceptions about future policy
moves may induce a small rise in private money market rates. Treasury
bill rates already have adjusted upward relative to private short-term
rates in reflection of actual and near-term heavy supply. Thus, they
could edge up by less than private rates--to the 8 percent level--as the
recent surge in bill issuance recedes after the initial RTC funding is
completed. Intermediate- and long-term yields could move up over coming
months, though by limited amounts should inflation remain moderate in line
with the staff forecast. Supported by slightly higher market rates,
strength in the dollar on foreign exchange markets could persist, at least
for a time.
","alternative B"
1989-11-14,9,"(9) Market interest rates generally are expected to remain around
current levels under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alterna-
tive B. The structure of market interest rates appears to embody another
slight easing of monetary policy, but most probably not until late this
year or early next year. In addition, impressions of a sluggish economy,
consistent with data flows likely under the staff forecast, may continue
to foster expectations of future policy easing, even if federal funds
rates remain near 8-1/2 percent. Unlike most other rates, those on short-
term Treasury bills may drop once the large supply of cash management
bills is absorbed into portfolios, with the 3-month bill rate moving down
toward 7-1/2 percent. The exchange value of the dollar could exhibit
little net change over the intermeeting period under alternative B, though
any policy tightening abroad may tend to exert downward pressure on the
","alternative B"
1989-12-18,9,"(9) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee
consideration. The specifications of alternative B involve federal funds
continuing to trade in the 8-1/2 percent area in association with adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing of $150 million. Under alternative A, the
federal funds rate would decline to the 8 percent area accompanying a
decline in adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to $100 million. Federal
funds would return to the 9 percent area under alternative C, associated
with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $200 million. The differences
in the borrowing levels among the three alternatives, $50 million, is only
half that contained in recent bluebooks. The low level to which seasonal
borrowing has fallen, together with the continued close proximity of
adjustment borrowing to frictional levels, implies that borrowing probably
has become even more unresponsive to the spread between the funds rate and
the discount rate.5  Uncertainties in the relationship between the funds
rate and borrowing, even more of a problem at such low levels of
borrowing, continue to call for flexibility in the Desk's approach to the
borrowing objective.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1990-03-27,9,"(9) Financial market participants evidently expect no monetary
policy change in the near term, meaning that a funds rate around the 8-1/4
percent level of alternative B is built into the current structure of
market interest rates. Even so, alternative B would involve some easing
in Treasury bill rates from most recent levels to the extent that supply
pressures in the market dissipate. That will depend to some extent on the
pace of RTC activity and associated working capital needs. Greater RTC

funding needs would be met in the first instance by a drawdown in Treasury
cash balances--since some RTC working capital usage has already been
financed--and only subsequently by augmenting Treasury borrowing. Conse-
quently, we are projecting a substantial paydown in Treasury bills over
the intermeeting period after the tax date. Moreover, central bank sales
of Treasury securities to fund their dollar sales in foreign exchange
markets could drop off at any time should intervention activity decline.
The staff anticipates relative stability in the exchange value of the
dollar under alternative B. Decisions regarding economic and monetary
union of East and West Germany, which are to be made by the end of April,
could affect the dollar's value against the mark. If those decisions
heighten expectations of German inflation, the dollar could continue under
upward pressure against the mark; increases in German interest rates owing
solely to such expectations would not necessarily affect real and nominal
interest rates in the United States. Bond prices in the U.S. will remain
most sensitive to prospects for U.S. economic growth and inflation.
Incoming data on prices and the economy about in line with staff expecta-
tions should not change market expectations that Federal Reserve policy
will remain essentially unchanged for a time, and consequently would be
associated with only minor movements in bond yields.
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1990-08-21,9,"(9) The three short-run monetary policy alternatives presented
below embody unchanged, decreased, and increased pressures in the reserve
market. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around
seasonal borrowing at the discount window of $500 million. Under alterna-
tive A, the drop in the federal funds rate to 7-1/2 percent would accom-
pany a reduction in borrowed reserves to roughly $450 million, while the
about $550 million in borrowing. With adjustment borrowing likely to
remain subdued, as generally has been the case this year, and with sea-
sonal borrowing anticipated to begin its normal annual downtrend later in
the intermeeting period, technical reductions in the borrowing specifica-
tion may be needed to keep the federal funds rate around its intended
trading area under each of the alternatives.
","alternative B"
1990-11-13,9,"(9) Interest rates currently embody anticipation of a 1/4 point
drop in the funds rate in the near-term. Nevertheless, market rates are
not likely to back up significantly under the unchanged reserve conditions
of alternative B, since expectations of an easing would be maintained if,
as expected, incoming information confirms a weakening economy. An un-
changed policy would provide some underpinning for the foreign exchange
value of the dollar, especially if market participants see that stance as
in part motivated by concerns about potential further weakening in the
dollar. Quality spreads may widen further, reflecting year-end position-
ing and mounting concerns about defaults. A number of large banks, espe-
cially those with weak capital positions and eroding access to capital
markets, expect to be holding down balance sheet totals to bolster capital
positions and investor confidence. At the same time, many investors,
particularly mutual funds and others publishing year-end statements, are
likely to intensify efforts to shed assets of less than top quality,
including holdings of some bank obligations. Under these conditions, it
will be difficult to distinguish transitory disturbances in relative
interest rates and credit flows from signals of more fundamental and last-
ing problems of borrowers.
","alternative B"
1991-03-26,9,"(9) The structure of market interest rates does not now appear
to incorporate expectations of any further easing in monetary policy in
the weeks ahead; thus under alternative B, short-term interest rates are
unlikely to change substantially, though they may edge lower. Private
rates should slip off with the passing of quarter-end, and bills could
well benefit from steeper reductions in outstanding supplies after the
April tax date. The greenbook forecast implies some further unwinding of
the recent sharp rise in the dollar under the unchanged policy of alterna-
tive B. Still, with interest rate differentials now more favorable to
dollar assets, the dollar should remain well above its February lows.
Longer-term securities markets are likely to continue to be quite sensi-
tive to data about developments in the real economy over the intermeeting
period, as investors search for indications as to whether consumer and
business responses to the end of the war are helping to propel a turn-
around in the economy. Bond yields already seem to have built in some
rebound in the economy, judging by their levels relative to inflation
expectations and to short-term rates. Thus, they might not rise much, if
at all, even should incoming information confirm that the economy was
reaching a trough.
","alternative B"
1991-05-14,9,"(9) Money growth projections under the two alternatives are
shown below. (More detailed data appear in the table and charts on the
following pages.) Under both alternatives, the monetary aggregates are
expected to strengthen in May and June from their reduced April rates,
keeping M2 and M3 in the middle portions of their annual ranges through
midyear. The projected pickup in M2 growth primarily reflects the unwind-
ing of apparently tax-related weakness in April. The effects of previous
declines in interest rates continue to contribute to the growth of M2
relative to income. However, largely because of the downward revisions to
forecasts for nominal income in the second quarter, we now expect M2
growth over March to June to fall short of the pace specified in the last
directive. This shortfall occurs despite the slight easing in money mar-
ket rates at the end of April and persists even with the further drop in
rates under alternative A. The March-to-June growth projected for M3 also
has been lowered since the last meeting, but in this case the reduction
results entirely from the aggregate's unexpected weakness in April. Pro-
jected expansion of M3 in May and June is about the same as in the last
bluebook, as additional issuance of CDs by U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks offsets the effect of slower growth in M2 and depository

","alternative A"
1991-08-20,9,"(9) In light of persistent weakness in the broader monetary
aggregates and other indicators pointing to a sluggish recovery, mar-
kets currently see a distinct possibility of some further easing of
policy in the weeks ahead. With reserve market pressures unchanged,
as under alternative B, rates might firm a touch. Such a firming
would further diminish prospects for a cut in the prime rate. The
extent of any backup in rates, though, would depend on incoming infor-
mation: Indeed, rates might remain near current levels should M2 run
along the lower band of its annual range, as the staff expects, and if
new information casts further doubts on the strength of the recovery.
Should pressures on insurance companies mount, quality spreads on
lower-rated corporate debt could widen as insurers curtail lending to
this segment of the market. The dollar likely would trade around
current levels under alternative B, but could firm a notch if U.S.
interest rates were to back up.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1991-10-01,9,"(9) The size and timing of the 1/2 percentage point drop in
the federal funds rate of alternative A would tend to catch financial
markets unawares, inducing almost as large a drop in other short-term
interest rates. In the context of weak money growth, such an easing
might be seen as signifying Federal Reserve concern that financial
conditions, including credit availability, were not consistent with a
moderate expansion of the economy. In these circumstances, long-term
rates would be likely to drop, at least initially, in normal propor-
tion to the decline in short-term rates. Should subsequent data
suggest, however, that the recovery is already on track and inflation
progress only moderate, long-term rates might back up a bit, as the
lower level of short-term rates appeared unsustainable. The value of
the dollar on exchange markets would ratchet lower in response to the
downward movement of interest rates in the United States relative to
those abroad.
","alternative A"
1991-11-05,9,"(10) M2 would be expected to continue to expand at a 3 per-
cent rate in the November and December period under alternative B, the
same as expected at the October FOMC meeting. The negative impact on
M2 of the weaker picture for income and spending growth is likely to
be about offset by the effects on opportunity costs of the most recent
policy easing and by what promises to be a larger than previously
expected slowdown in RTC resolution activity in the fourth quarter.
In October, resolutions fell to a much reduced level that now seems
likely to persist through year-end owing to legislative delays, which
largely removes one restraining influence on retail deposits. Growth
of demand deposits, however, is expected to fall back from October's
atypical surge and show through to a slowing in M1 growth to a 7-1/4
percent pace over November and December.4  In the fourth quarter of
this year, M2 expansion at a 2 percent rate on a quarterly average
basis would imply a rise in its velocity of 1-1/2 percent at an annual
rate, down markedly from the 4-1/2 percent pace of the third quarter.
Under this policy alternative, M2 would be on a trajectory to enter
of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
","alternative B"
1992-03-31,9,"(9) Markets appear to anticipate no change in policy over the
intermeeting period, and thus interest rates should remain close to
current levels under alternative B. Nevertheless, there could be a
downward bias to rate movements over coming months. Information on the
economy consistent with the greenbook forecast may be somewhat more
mixed than recent releases, and with aggregate price measures damped and
money growth slower, expectations of future inflation and the likelihood
of monetary tightening later in the year could be revised down. Any
tendency toward rate declines might be reinforced if the market became
convinced that a fiscal stimulus package had been definitively ruled
out. Under these circumstances, the dollar could reverse some of its
recent gains.
","alternative B"
1992-05-19,9,"(9) Although market participants apparently view the prospects
for the next policy action as more heavily favoring an easing than a
tightening, no immediate policy change seems to remain the predominant
view. Consequently, prices in domestic credit and foreign exchange
markets probably would not show much reaction should the Committee main-
tain current reserve market conditions by choosing alternative B at this
meeting. Economic expansion along the lines projected in the greenbook
and money growth remaining near the lower end of the Committee's range
(discussed below) are likely to continue to foster some downward bias in
market expectations for reserve market pressures for a time. Maintain-
ing unchanged conditions over the entire intermeeting period eventually
could cause some short-term rates to edge higher and dollar exchange
rates to strengthen a little as markets reassessed the Federal Reserve's
intentions. However, long-term yields are likely to remain fairly
steady or possibly even edge down as expectations for growth and infla-
tion are trimmed back; the passage of an effective balanced budget
amendment would add to downward pressures on long-term rates.
","alternative B"
1992-08-18,9,"(9) A reversal of the July easing would take market partici-
pants completely by surprise and short-term interest rates would rise by
at least 1/2 percentage point under alternative C. Bond rates, too,
would retrace some of their recent declines under this alternative, at
least initially, and quality spreads on private debt could widen if such
a tightening were seen as placing the recovery at risk. The dollar
would rebound appreciably.
","alternative C"
1992-12-22,9,"(9) Although many market participants have come to the view
that monetary policy easing has run its course for the current economic
cycle, none appears to expect a tightening to be implemented in the near
term, as in alternative C. Consequently, short-term Treasury rates
would jump by the full 50 basis point increase in the federal funds
rate. Private rates could increase a bit more, as market participants
built in higher risk premiums in response to the greater odds that the
economic expansion could slow. The increase in long-term yields,
however, would be held down by the enhanced credibility of the Federal
Reserve's price stability objective, and the yield curve should flatten
somewhat. The foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise
","alternative C"
1993-03-23,9,"(9) The easing of policy under alternative A would surprise
market participants and would lead to a decline in short-term rates,
including the prime rate, commensurate with the 1/2 percentage point
drop in the federal funds rate. In such circumstances, bankers might be
more encouraged to ease lending standards and nonprice terms on business
loans. Rate declines at longer maturities would be muted should market
participants see the easing in the absence of weak economic data as
risking a sustained resurgence of inflation. Conversely, the tightening
of policy under alternative C, which also would come as a surprise to
market participants, would induce a rise in short-term rates comparable
to the hike in the federal funds rate. The increase in intermediate-
and long-term rates would be lessened to the degree it were seen as a
timely measure to hold inflation in check. To the extent that market
participants saw dimmer prospects for economic activity, risk premiums
incorporated in yields on private obligations would increase. The ex-
change value of the dollar would move in the same direction as domestic
interest rates under either alternative.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1993-05-18,9,"(9) In light of recent price reports, market participants now
generally seem to expect that the next change in the stance of monetary
policy is somewhat more likely to be toward tightening than toward ease,
but few appear to anticipate any move immediately after the May FOMC
meeting. Thus, market interest rates are unlikely to react to the
implementation of alternative B. The odds are that bond yields will
retrace at least some of their recent back-up if--as anticipated in the
greenbook forecast--the news on inflationary pressures proves more
favorable. The ongoing budget debates and the prospective announcement
of the Administration's health reform plan suggest that the volatility
associated with an uncertain fiscal outlook may persist. Shorter-term
rates could rise some with the approach of larger auction volumes of
bills and shorter-term notes. The value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets probably would remain around current levels under
alternative B.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1993-08-17,9,"(9) Over the balance of 1993, M2 is projected to grow at about
a 1-1/2 percent pace under alternative B, and, as shown in the table
below, to finish the year around the lower bound of its new annual
range. Although special factors that have boosted M2 growth in
recent months are seen as fading somewhat, underlying growth in this
aggregate is boosted by a little faster growth in nominal income. The
lure of capital market instruments--from the still fairly steep yield
curve and reported capital gains on securities to date--is expected to
remain strong, and inflows to mutual funds probably will stay near the
record pace of the year thus far. As a consequence, the velocity of M2
is expected to increase at a 3 percent rate in the second half of the
year, only a little less than the 4 percent rate of the first half.7
M3 under alternative B is projected to bottom out in August and to edge
higher over the remainder of the year. Although bank credit growth
should slow a bit, more of it is expected to be funded by deposits,
given the very comfortable capital levels of many banks. Still, M3
would finish the year a little below its fourth-quarter 1992 base and
the lower bound of its range.

growth in this aggregate, however, will remain quite sluggish.
Although the flatter yield curve should eventually damp the shift from
M2 to capital market assets, we do not expect any slowing in the near
term: indeed, with recent capital gains enhancing the advertised
returns on mutual funds, inflows could remain quite brisk. On a
quarterly average basis, growth in M2 would slow to a 1-1/2 percent
rate in the fourth quarter, implying growth for the year on a Q4-to-Q4

banks' needs for funds. Moreover, the RTC, with new funding author-
ity, is expected to begin working down its backlog of resolutions in
coming months, leading to more rapid shrinkage of thrift institutions
and the substitution of Treasury financing for deposit financing to
carry acquired assets.

1993-11-16,9,"(9) As shown in the lower panel of the above table, M2 under
alternative B is projected to grow at a 2-1/2 percent rate over October
to March. This would leave M2 in the fourth quarter 1-1/4 percent above
its Q4 1992 base, just within its 1 to 5 percent annual range. By next
March, this aggregate would be 2-3/4 percent at an annual rate above its
fourth quarter 1993 base, and well within its provisional range. The
firming in M2 growth over the next several months reflects forecasts of
stronger expansion in nominal GDP late this year, the effects of the
recent surge in mortgage refinancing activity, and lagged stimulus from

the previous flattening of the yield curve. Despite the latter two
effects, M2 velocity rises noticeably further in the fourth and first
quarters as funds continue to be diverted from deposits into longer-term
mutual funds. For that reason, the velocity of M2+, which adds the
market value of net holdings of bond and stock mutual funds to M2, seems
likely to remain more stable than that of M2 in coming quarters. Ml,
which is projected to expand at a 10-1/2 percent rate from October to
March, would still account for all of the increase in M2. The continued
brisk pace of M1 growth mainly owes to earlier declines in its oppor-
tunity cost, but sustained strong foreign currency demands also are seen
as supporting expansion of this aggregate. With core deposits and
non-deposit sources continuing to fund the bulk of moderate expansion of
bank credit, issuance of managed liabilities in M3 should remain weak.
M3 would increase at a 1-1/2 percent rate from October to March. This
aggregate would be a little above the lower bound of its 0 to 4 percent
range for 1993 and more distinctly within its tentative 1994 range by
","alternative B"
1993-12-21,9,"(9) Nonetheless, substantial portfolio shifts are expected
to persist, as the yield curve remains relatively steep, and these
shifts will continue to damp the growth of M2 relative to nominal
income. The velocity of M2 in the first quarter would rise at a
for the current quarter. M2 by March would have expanded at a 2 per-
cent annual rate from its fourth-quarter 1993 base under alternative
B, placing this aggregate well above the lower end of its provisional
growth in the first quarter could be especially volatile and difficult
to interpret. Seasonal factors were distorted by policy-induced
surges in money in early 1991 and 1992. In addition, amounts and
patterns of tax payments, and associated adjustments in money hold-
ings, could be atypical, given the uncertain effects of the new tax

1994-03-22,9,"(9) With market participants expecting appreciable increases
in the federal funds rate in coming months, including 25 basis points
at the March FOMC meeting, interest rates could tend to drift lower
under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. Rate de-
clines would be quite small initially if market participants still
believed that the next tightening step was imminent but had merely
been delayed, perhaps by the unsettled market conditions of late. As
the intermeeting period unfolds, economic data in line with the Green-
book projection should suggest moderate economic growth and no inten-
sification of inflation pressures, and interest rates could fall
noticeably under this alternative as markets reassessed the trajectory
of Federal Reserve tightening. The scope for any rate decreases,
especially at the long end of the market, could be quite limited,
however, if the hiatus in tightening were to call into question the
Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary resolve.
","alternative B, alternative a"
1994-08-16,9,"(9) Market participants now seem to expect at least a 25
basis point increase in the federal funds rate at the August meeting,
with some possibility of a 50 basis point increase; a 4-3/4 percent
funds rate is anticipated by late September. In these circumstances,
the choice of no change in the stance of policy under alternative B
would result in some decline in short-term interest rates, and the
dollar might tend to weaken on foreign exchange markets. Long-term
rates could move lower, at least initially. Market participants might
view the absence of action as indicating a milder degree of tightening
into the future as well--perhaps because the Federal Reserve saw less
inflation in the outlook than previously thought. However, rate de-
clines would be limited to the extent that market participants ques-
tioned the Fed's anti-inflation resolve; absent subsequent data point-
ing to further weakening in aggregate demand or surprisingly modest
price pressures, concerns about inflation would mount, pushing up
longer-term interest rates.
","alternative B"
1994-09-27,9,"(9) Market opinions on what the Committee might do at this
meeting are split. Some analysts have interpreted the recent economic
news as implying sufficiently greater inflation potential to overcome
any presumption of a policy pause; they expect a firming action, per-
haps of 50 basis points. Others still anticipate a hiatus in the
process of policy tightening; however, even many of those in the
latter camp seem to expect some action no later than the November
meeting. While few actually foresee a 25 basis point increase, the
composite effect of these different views has produced a federal funds
futures rate for October that is 25 basis points above the current
funds rate. Nonetheless, maintenance of existing reserve conditions
under alternative B might elicit little reaction in rates beyond the
very shortest maturities because market participants would assume that
tightening had simply been postponed. In these circumstances, longer-
term instruments might trade in their current ranges at least for a
time, although security prices probably will remain quite sensitive to
news bearing on inflation pressures as market participants attempt to
gauge the extent of future policy restraint. In that regard, under
the staff forecast, economic releases over the next few months would
suggest that inflation is on a slightly higher track and that final
demand remains fairly vigorous. Absent unanticipated changes in
policy abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar most likely
would remain around its current level, though it could come under some
downward pressure if inflation expectations began to deteriorate
","alternative B"
1994-11-15,9,"(9) Choice of the unchanged policy of alternative B might be
based on the judgments that most of the effects of previous increases
in interest rates are still in the pipeline, that convincing signs of
higher inflation have not yet appeared, and that under these circum-
stances the Committee can await evidence indicating whether the
effects of previous monetary tightening will be sufficient to restrain
spending adequately. The weakness in the monetary aggregates and
moderate expansion of overall measures of credit may be seen as
offering support for the view that financial conditions are not con-
ducive to a sustained pickup in inflation. Indeed, even without
another tightening move, M2 seems likely to come in just below the
come in at only 2 percent.
","alternative B"
1995-03-28,9,"(9) The softer cast to recent economic data along with
statements by Federal Reserve officials have led market participants
to the virtually unanimous opinion that the FOMC will keep its policy
stance on hold at this Committee meeting. Consequently, there would
likely be little change in interest rates in response to the choice of
alternative B. While sentiment in foreign exchange markets has proven
difficult to predict, no clear rationale presents itself for signifi-
cant further dollar depreciation over the intermeeting period.
","alternative B"
1995-05-23,9,"(9) Market participants generally anticipate no change in
the stance of monetary policy at this meeting. Thus, market rates
would not be expected to react to selection of alternative B by the
Committee. However, the recent shifts in the yield curve seem to
embody expectations of continued underlying softness in aggregate
demand sufficient to induce the Federal Reserve to ease policy later
in the year. Under the staff forecast, incoming information on spend-
ing would suggest a bit more vigor in the economy than would be con-
sistent with the market's outlook, and interest rates may tend to edge
higher on balance over the intermeeting period. Market conditions
could remain volatile. Expectations about the economic and policy
outlook may be especially prone to revision, given the size and
recency of the shift in sentiment. In addition, financial asset
prices may be sensitive to progress through the Congress of the
various fiscal policy initiatives currently under discussion.
","alternative B"
1995-08-22,9,"(9) Alternative B might be favored to the extent that the
staff forecast were seen to be credible and the outcome to balance
acceptably Committee concerns about expansion in output with those of
the containment of inflation. The stronger economic data available
over the recent intermeeting period could be read as suggesting that
policy in the latter part of 1994 and first part of 1995 might not
have been as restraining as suggested by the level of short-term real
rates relative to their long-run averages. Nominal values of the
foreign exchange value of the dollar and of bond yields are still
appreciably below their levels of last fall, even though the nominal
federal funds has been raised 1 percentage point on balance since that
time. With inflation relatively subdued, it seems highly likely that
real exchange rates and long-term interest rates have fallen notice-
ably as well over the last nine months. These declines, together with
generally supportive credit conditions, could be viewed as underpin-
ning the continued momentum in business and household spending. In
any event, an unchanged stance of policy would buy time for more in-
formation to accumulate to determine whether the economy is indeed on
track to a sustainable pace of expansion.
","Alternative B"
1995-11-15,9,"(9) The Greenbook forecast assumes no significant macro-
economic effects from any temporary disruptions incurred in the
process of determining the longer-run stance of fiscal policy. As
core consumer inflation staying at about 3 percent. Despite the lack
of a downward tilt to the inflation projection, the Committee still
might favor the unchanged stance of policy in alternative B if it
viewed the benefits of further disinflation as insufficient to justify
a more restrictive policy stance that pushed the economy below its
potential. The case for alternative B would be even stronger if the
Committee viewed the staff inflation forecast as too pessimistic--
either because spending would be weaker or because the price-output
relationship would be more favorable than the staff assessment.
Moreover, uncertainties about the economic outlook might seem par-
ticularly large, both because of the fiscal situation and because of
conflicting signals about spending and production. Such circumstances
could reinforce the desire to stand pat, awaiting clarification of the
","alternative B, alternative B"
1995-12-19,9,"(9) In these circumstances, adoption of the unchanged money
market conditions of alternative B could prompt a small backup in
market interest rates. The rise in yields is likely to be damped, as
investors would continue to expect monetary policy easing before long.
The sense that policy action was merely postponed would be more pro-
nounced if a budget agreement had not been reached by the time of the
Committee meeting. Maintenance of the current monetary policy stance
over time, however, particularly after a budget agreement has been
struck, would lead market participants to reexamine their expectations
for monetary policy. If they saw the current 5-3/4 percent funds rate
being sustained for a considerable period in the context of a satis-
factorily performing macroeconomy, then long-term rates might ulti-
mately rise by no more than the approximately 1/2 percentage point
""surprise"" in the funds rate. Such an increase would reverse only a
small portion of the drop in rates over the last year, returning
nominal long-term rates to about their levels of late summer, while
leaving real rates perhaps a bit higher than they were at that time
given the downward drift in inflation expectations over recent months.
","alternative B"
1996-03-26,9,"(9) With market participants apparently expecting no policy
action over the next few months, maintenance of current reserve condi-
tions, as under alternative B, would elicit little reaction in credit
markets. Capital market prices could remain volatile as incoming
information continues to be difficult to interpret in the wake of the
winter's economic disruptions. Although the anticipated softening of
many indicators in March, such as payroll employment and industrial
production, might boost markets for a time, data consistent with the
staff forecast would seem, on balance, to imply little net change in
longer-term yields. Market participants have largely discounted any
chance of a multi-year budget agreement before the elections, so a
renewal of meaningful negotiations on long-term deficit reduction has
the potential to raise bond and stock prices. Absent such a develop-
ment or unanticipated changes in policy abroad, the foreign exchange
value of the dollar probably would remain around its current level.
","alternative B"
1996-09-24,9,"(9) With market participants apparently placing greater than
even odds on policy tightening at this meeting, interest rates would
likely decline and the dollar weaken on foreign exchange markets if
the unchanged policy of alternative B were adopted. Even before the
discount rate story earlier this week, markets had built in close to
would trigger rate declines that not only reversed the increases
associated with the story, but some of those registered earlier in the
intermeeting period as well. Many would likely view the Committee as
merely delaying policy action until the November meeting rather than
changing its fundamental assessment of the potential inflation threat,
and this reaction would tend to limit the decline in long-term rates.
There is a risk that policy inaction would induce some in the market
to question the Committee's commitment to holding down inflation, or
its willingness to take forward-looking action to do so, which would
tend to boost inflation expectations. Given uncertainties about the
outlook and the perceived lack of a policy consensus within the
Federal Reserve, markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to new
economic data and to indications of Committee members' inclinations.
","alternative B"
1996-11-13,9,"(9) The choice of alternative C would come as a surprise to
market participants. Most likely, they would infer that the Committee
sees considerably more risk of greater inflation pressures than is
generally perceived. Interest rates could rise markedly across the
term structure--perhaps almost as much at short-term maturities as the
interest rates would be likely to boost the dollar on foreign exchange
markets. Financial prices could be volatile for a time as market
participants reappraised the economic outlook and the likely path for
monetary policy, and appreciable declines in equity values cannot be
ruled out.
","alternative C"
1996-12-17,9,"(9) With market participants almost universally expecting policy to be on hold
for a time, the Committee's selection of alternative B would prompt little response in
financial markets. Expectations about the economy built into credit markets appear to
be similar to those of the staff, and new information in agreement with that outlook
over the intermeeting period should be associated with both interest rates and the
exchange rate of the dollar averaging near recent levels. However, signs of significant
progress in the political process in resolving budget and entitlement controversies
probably would spark a rally in bond and stock markets.
","alternative B"
1997-05-20,9,"(9) Many analysts continue to predict that the Committee will tighten policy at this
meeting. However, in recent weeks, markets appear to have removed all but modest odds of
any action, and the choice of alternative B should trigger a relatively minor decline in rates.
As the intermeeting period progresses, incoming evidence confirming the staff forecast of
markedly slower second-quarter growth in real GDP and still-quiescent inflation readings
could further erode expectations of policy firming, fueling additional price gains in fixed-
income markets. As an exception, the recent decline in the three-month bill rate should begin
to unwind significantly with the approach of renewed net bill issuance in July. The exchange
value of the dollar probably would fluctuate around its recent lower levels or even drift lower.
","alternative B"
1997-08-19,9,"(9) Moderating growth in output will still leave utilization in the labor market
substantially above levels that in the past have been associated with accelerating prices. If
the Committee wants more insurance against the possibility that inflation will begin to pick
up, and especially if it wishes to tilt the odds a little in the direction of further progress
toward price stability over coming years, it may wish to raise the intended federal funds rate
at this meeting, perhaps by the 25 basis points of alternative C. With strong demand over
the past year and a half propelling the economy beyond the level of its estimated potential,
real short-term rates might be seen as having been below their equilibriums. One reason for
this situation may be that, despite a high real federal funds rate relative to its historical
average, financial market conditions evidently have been supportive of spending--spreads
faced by private borrowers are quite narrow and equity prices remain at a high level.
Although inflation performance has been surprisingly good of late, the effects of a stronger
dollar have played an important role that is not likely to be repeated in the next few years,
and signs of resurgent labor militancy may indicate reduced worker insecurity. Although
inflation expectations have fallen, the recent volatility in financial markets suggests that in
those markets such expectations may not be firmly anchored, and could turn around reason-
ably quickly once inflation begins to pick up. In those circumstances, delaying policy action
ultimately could turn out to be costly in terms of economic performance.
","alternative C"
1997-09-30,9,"(9) The Committee's choice of alternative C at this meeting would catch market
participants completely unawares. Money market rates would rise at least as much as the 25
basis point hike in the federal funds rate, and intermediate- and long-term rates could increase
substantially as well. The extent of the increase, of course, would depend on market
participants' interpretation of the rationale for Federal Reserve action. The action might be
viewed as simply a purchase of limited additional insurance against higher inflation in
response to a spurt to final demand. Alternatively, the tightening might be taken as evidence
that the Federal Reserve had not become as optimistic as market participants have come to
suspect it was about the economy's ability to produce at unusually high rates without
generating more inflation; such a reassessment might even lead some investors to revise their
own views about inflation as well as about future Federal Reserve behavior. In either case,
the implied rise in real rates would buoy the exchange value of the dollar but depress equity
values. Stock prices might be doubly hit if confidence in the expected growth of earnings
were shaken not only by the prospects for tighter policy but also by a less favorable view of
the long-run path of potential output. In these circumstances, incoming data bearing on the
strength of spending and inflation pressure would be especially scrutinized, and large swings
in financial prices might become even more common.
","alternative C"
1997-11-12,9,"(9) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment that the U.S. economy has
overshot its sustainable productive potential, it may be disposed to tighten its policy stance, as
in the 25 basis point rise in the funds rate in alternative C. With markets still somewhat
unsettled, the extent of their reactions to a policy tightening is especially difficult to gauge,
and the odds that those reactions, both in the United States and abroad, could be outsized are
probably higher than usual. Under these circumstances, if the Committee were inclined to
tighten, it might consider waiting until it had greater assurance that domestic and foreign
financial markets have quieted further. The Committee would be led to raise rates if it
judged the threat of an inflationary uptrend to be serious enough to justify a preemptive
policy initiative, even in the absence of any evidence in hand of actual acceleration in prices.
In light of the persistent strength of final demand to date, the likely effects of recent financial
market events on the U.S. inflation outlook could well be seen as too minor to assuage
Committee concerns about intensifying inflationary forces. The Committee may judge that
the impacts of weaker economies and currencies in Asia on U.S. export volume and import
prices will be relatively limited. Also, given the small net size of the stock market decline,
the cost of equity capital may be seen as remaining low enough, when combined with the still
accommodative credit conditions for businesses in securities markets and at financial
intermediaries, to undergird continued heavy investment spending. Similarly, household
financial wealth may be regarded as remaining elevated enough, when considered together
with likely persisting employment gains and still high consumer confidence, to keep
consumption spending on a strong path. A policy tightening--even if delayed until markets
stabilize--likely would induce further sizable downward adjustments to stock prices, and bond
prices as well, and bolster the exchange value of the dollar. However, these market responses
could be viewed as a necessary aspect of the transmission of monetary policy restraint. For
example, in the staff forecast, a decline of around 20 percent in stock prices over the next
year or so is a key element in limiting the rise in inflation.
","alternative C"
1997-12-16,9,"(9) While the economy continues to operate in the staff forecast at a level above
estimates of its potential, inflation remains quiescent for some time with no change in the
federal funds rate and stays relatively low over the forecast period. Even if the Committee is
concerned about the pressures on labor resources and finds the eventual uptrend in underlying
inflation unacceptable, it may be willing to keep the funds rate constant at this meeting, as
under Alternative B. In the staff forecast, the emergence of inflation has been pushed back
enough to suggest that delaying possible firming to await further information about global and
national economic developments runs minimal risk of embedding higher inflation and
inflation expectations in economic decisionmaking. The situation in a number of foreign
markets and economies remains quite unsettled, amplifying uncertainties about the extent of
the global retrenchment and its implications for the U.S. financial markets and economy. The
circumstances are sufficiently fluid that the Committee might see some possibility of a major
economic retrenchment, which could be exacerbated by a preemptive tightening of U.S.
monetary policy at this time. Under alternative B, the Committee would be buying time to
assess the extent to which developments abroad restrain aggregate demand, depress oil prices,
and support the dollar, as well as the degree to which recent momentum in the economy
might be sustained. More data might also be seen as especially useful in sorting out some of
the questions about underlying pressures on labor compensation and the extent to which
productivity behavior might damp the feed-through of higher compensation to profit margins
and prices.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1998-03-31,9,"(9) Because financial markets are placing very low odds on a change in policy in
the near term, the choice of alternative B would likely have little immediate impact on
domestic financial markets or the exchange value of the dollar. However, were incoming data
on the economy to confirm that growth is moderating appreciably while inflation remains
subdued, as in the staff forecast, market participants might again build in greater odds on a
policy easing, perhaps on the view that the high real funds rate does indicate a restrictive
policy stance. If so, intermediate- and long-term rates, along with the dollar, could edge
lower. In the stock market, prices could come under some downward pressure even if interest
rates drift down, as generally bad news on earnings come to be seen not as a one-time hit
from the higher dollar or a temporary drop in demand from Asia, but rather as the precursor
of narrowing profit margins in a less robust economy. The softer earnings picture could also
prompt a little more caution on the part of creditors and some widening of quality spreads.
The implementation of policy may be complicated for a time after the mid-April tax date by
high, though uncertain, Treasury deposits at the Federal Reserve, which might require
outsized reserve injections and extraordinary amounts of collateral to be pledged to the
Federal Reserve by primary dealers. But any added volatility in the funds rate would be
temporary and should have little, if any, effect on interest rates further out the yield curve.
","alternative B"
1998-08-18,9,"(9) Markets would be somewhat unsettled by the 25 basis point firming action of
alternative C at this meeting, which would come as a surprise. Short-term market interest rates
probably would back up by at least the rise in the federal funds rate. Investors would project
lower earnings and use higher discount factors, and equity prices almost certainly would fall
significantly further. Boosted nonetheless by higher interest rates, the foreign exchange value of
the dollar likely would firm as well, with particularly large increases against the yen, and Asian
countries with currencies tied to the dollar would confront considerable pressures to adjust their
pegs. Longer-term dollar interest rates would probably jump initially in response to the rise in
short-term rates, but might reverse course before long if market participants began to question the
likely duration of the tightening move in view of the added strength in the dollar and lower
equity prices; still, real long-term rates are likely to remain at higher levels for a while. Credit-
risk spreads on domestic private debt, as well as on the obligations of a number of foreign
governments and firms, likely would widen noticeably.
","alternative C"
1998-09-29,9,"(9) If the Committee believed that, as in the staff forecast, a larger policy move were
needed to have an adequate effect in forestalling oncoming weakness in economic activity or if it
wanted to take more forceful action to address the risks facing financial markets here and abroad,
it might choose to reduce the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting (alternative A').
Depending on the wording of the announcement associated with such a move, the market might
see the FOMC as being on hold for a longer duration, eliminating for a little while market
uncertainty about whether additional easings were in the offing. Moves of 50 basis points have
been somewhat unusual in recent years, and, in volatile financial markets with largely
unanchored expectations, reactions are difficult to gauge. Most likely, equity markets would
rally and risk premiums on private debt would fall, as the FOMC was seen as taking a more
active stance in cushioning the effects of tighter financing conditions and weaker foreign demand
on economic activity. But there is some chance that market participants could interpret the larger
move as indicating that the Federal Reserve viewed the current economic situation as especially
serious, perhaps owing to fragility in the financial sector. If so, the rebound in equities could be
tempered while Treasury bond prices could be strengthened further. In any event, the value of
the dollar against major currencies would likely drop somewhat under this alternative.4 The
prime rate would likely be reduced by 1/2 percentage point.
","alternative A"
1998-11-17,9,"(9) The 25 basis point easing of policy under alternative A would tend to boost most
financial markets, given that the federal funds futures market evidently now has built in only
about even odds of such an action at this meeting. Consequently, rates on short-term private
market instruments, such as commercial paper, likely would move a little lower following
implementation of alternative A. With the easing perhaps fostering additional attenuation of
concerns about private credit risks, the unusual recent safe-harbor demands for Treasuries would
abate further, and Treasury bill yields probably would fall less than those on private instruments.
Similarly, in longer-term markets, private rates also likely would decline, as would those on
older, less-liquid Treasury notes and bonds, while yields for on-the-run Treasuries might be little
changed as more of the recent flight-to-liquidity is unwound. Falling rates and improving
liquidity in markets for private securities probably would augment the recent tendency for some
rebound in trading volumes, and the better market conditions could help spur issuance, including
some deals previously postponed because of market turbulence. The value of the dollar on
foreign exchange markets likely would decline somewhat, and financial strains in foreign
markets probably would moderate further.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1999-03-30,9,"(9) If the Committee were concerned that inflation was likely to be on an upward
path, as in the staff forecast, it might favor the 1/4 percentage point tightening in the intended
federal funds rate of alternative C. With aggregate demand remaining strong, credit conditions
improving further, and many emerging market economies showing signs of stabilizing, the
Committee might believe that the current meeting is an appropriate time to roll back the policy
easing of last November, initiating the policy action needed to contain inflation over time. Many
on the Committee had viewed the last easing action as an insurance policy taken out as a
precaution against further financial turmoil and a significant broadening of the crises in emerging
markets. While this action may have helped to forestall these eventualities, in current
circumstances they would be unlikely to surface if that action were reversed. The desirability of
immediate tightening would be enhanced to the extent that the Committee read recent data on
spending as indicating that the growth of aggregate demand would not slow as in the staff
projection but rather would remain unsustainably strong absent a tightening of financial
conditions. With the unemployment rate already low and perhaps headed lower, real interest
rates would seem to be falling short of levels required to contain inflationary pressures.
Moreover, while domestic price increases in the past few years have run at a much slower pace
than might have been expected in light of labor market conditions, recently some of the forces
that may have been responsible for this result--declines in oil prices and inflation expectations--
show signs of reversing.
","alternative C"
1999-05-18,9,"(9) The response of financial markets to the continuation of an unchanged policy
stance, as under alternative B, would depend importantly on whether the Committee
announces a change in the tilt of the directive. Especially after the publication today of a
surprisingly large rise in the CPI in April, market participants reportedly see a good chance
that the Committee will announce a directive tilted toward tightening. Against that
backdrop, debt and equity markets could rally some if there were no announcement
regarding the symmetry of the directive; market participants would conclude that the
Committee chose a symmetric directive and probably would see a reduced likelihood of
future action. Over time, longer-term yields would fluctuate near these lower levels as
incoming output and price data in line with the Greenbook forecast suggest a slowing
economy and damped inflation but still the possibility of eventual tightening. Under these
conditions, the average value of the dollar should not move far from its recent range. If, on
the other hand, the Committee decided to adopt and announce a tilt in its directive toward
tightening, market participants probably would place slightly higher odds on a policy
tightening sometime over the next few meetings, pushing up interest and exchange rates
modestly further. Also, with the Committee seen as more inclined to act, markets could well
become more sensitive to information bearing on the price outlook.
","alternative B"
1999-08-24,9,"(9) News that the Committee was standing pat, as under alternative B, would
come as a considerable surprise in the market, triggering a rally in capital markets and
putting further downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar. That
reaction would be tempered if the Committee chose and announced a directive tilted toward
restraint, thus preserving expectations of a higher funds rate in the near term. This
approach might be favored if the Committee believed tightening was probably needed fairly
promptly but wanted to be more assured that an acceleration of costs and prices was in
train. In these circumstances, however, financial markets could remain volatile as market
participants awaited policy action, with possible adverse effects on spreads. If, instead, the
Committee thought that the sense in financial markets that policy tightening is almost
inevitable were inconsistent with its own assessment of the situation, this market
misconception could be countered by announcing that a neutral bias was being retained,
though the announcement would need to convey a more balanced sense of risks than the
market now sees as implied by the ""asymmetrical symmetry"" of the June directive and
related announcement. The expected path of short-term rates would be revised down, but a
traditional symmetry might elevate market participants' uncertainty about the Federal
Reserve's assessment of inflation risks and policy intentions in light of the inflationary
concerns expressed in the Chairman's testimony.
","alternative B"
1999-10-05,9,"(9) The Committee instead could favor a 1/4 percentage point firming in the
intended federal funds rate to 5-1/2 percent, as in alternative C. A rationale for this policy
tightening would be that the inflation uptrend embodied in the staff forecast is both likely
and unacceptable and warrants a faster and more aggressive policy response than is assumed
in that forecast. Indeed, the persistent strength of domestic final demand in the face of
elevated long-term rates and flat stock prices since the spring, the currently low inventory-
sales ratios, and the strengthening of activity abroad might be seen as pointing to risks that
are skewed toward an unemployment rate appreciably below 4 percent in the near future
and a greater intensification of inflation pressures. Although the markets are not fully
prepared for such an action and an outsized price reaction cannot be ruled out, the
Committee might be willing to accept even a sharp reduction in bond and stock prices as an
aspect of the process of containing inflation. The Committee might see action at this
meeting as especially desirable if it views potential financial disruptions as increasingly
militating against tightening policy between now and early next year and if it also sees that
interval as a period of time when firmer policy is going to be needed to prevent inflation
pressures from cumulating.
","alternative C"
1999-11-16,9,"(9) Even if the Committee, like the staff, sees forces at work tending to raise core
inflation over time, it may be sufficiently uncertain about that outcome that it still would
wish to leave the intended funds rate unchanged at this meeting at 5-1/4 percent, as under
alternative B, and to retain the tilt toward firming to convey a sense of the risks. Most
incoming data on prices and labor costs, including GDP prices, the ECI, average hourly
earnings, and unit labor costs, have once again proven to be surprisingly benign despite
increasingly taut labor markets. This string of favorable readings underscores questions
about the reliability of the traditional relationships that lie behind predictions that inflation
will pick up should resource utilization remain around its current level. Indeed, the revised
output data could be read as leaving open the possibility that productivity is continuing to
accelerate, perhaps substantially. While the associated increase in the marginal return on
capital projects would require higher real short-term interest rates at some point, the
economy could be able to produce beyond its long-run potential for a while longer without
an intensification of inflation so long as gains in real wages do not outstrip rising labor
productivity. In this circumstance, further policy tightening would be unnecessary for some
time. In light of the possibility that supply-side relationships continue to be unusually
favorable, the Committee might see considerable benefit from waiting for more solid
evidence that an inflationary upswing was in train. Even if productivity gains do not
materialize, the possible cost of delaying a firming in policy until early next year may not be
considered especially large since longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well
","alternative B"
2000-03-21,9,"(9) Any unwinding of the current degree of restraint in financial markets, which
incorporates 25 basis points of tightening at this meeting, might be viewed by the
Committee as exacerbating the risk of economic overheating. With little evidence in hand
that spending is moderating appreciably, aggregate demand still seems to be expanding more
rapidly than even optimistic estimates of the growth of potential aggregate supply. In these
circumstances, the Committee's assessment of the inflation risks may be such that it favors
an immediate tightening of policy, perhaps by raising the federal funds rate another 1/4
percentage point as in alternative C. The Committee might believe it especially important
to provide continuing evidence of its vigilance as the effect on inflation of the recent surge
in oil prices plays out in coming months. Even if the Committee anticipates that
considerably more policy firming will be needed eventually to contain inflation pressures, it
may still favor the gradual approach embodied in alternative C in light of the considerable
uncertainty about aggregate supply and about the effect of the substantial run-up in short-
and long-term interest rates in recent quarters on aggregate demand. Such gradualism also
may hold appeal because financial markets have been edgy and are potentially vulnerable to
an unexpectedly large policy move.
","alternative C, alternative C"
2000-05-16,9,"(9) The 25 basis point move of alternative C would be somewhat smaller than is
incorporated in financial market prices. Even if the Committee also announces that the
balance of risks remains skewed toward higher inflation, short rates still would decline, as
market participants marked down their expected near-term path for the funds rate target.
Longer-term yields also might edge down if market participants concluded that the Federal
Reserve would be pursuing a more gradual approach than they had anticipated, and this
strategy was not viewed as enhancing inflation risks. On the latter score, market participants
might infer from the small size of the policy move that inflationary pressures are a little less
intense than they had thought; such a response would, of course, be more plausible if the
CPI data to be released the morning of the meeting turn out to be benign. Equity prices
could rally, while the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets might change little.
But it cannot be ruled out that financial market participants would adopt a more skeptical
interpretation of limited Federal Reserve action. If a sense that the Committee had fallen
behind the curve of requisite policy firming became prevalent, which would be made more
likely by a disquieting CPI release, longer-term rates could back up, equity prices weaken, and
the dollar come under downward pressure.
","alternative C"
2000-08-22,9,"(9) The 25 basis point increase in the targeted funds rate of alternative C would
seem appropriate if the inflation forecasted by the staff were seen as likely and unacceptable.
It might be viewed as unacceptable in part because the already prevailing core CPI inflation
rate of 2-1/2 percent in the Greenbook may be judged to be inconsistent with the Federal
Reserve's longer-run objective of effective price stability. Even if the Committee were
willing to tolerate such a rate of price increase for a while, inflation is headed higher in the
staff forecast in that the economy already has overshot the levels of output and employment
that are sustainable in the longer run. In such circumstances, delaying needed policy firming
could allow inflationary pressures to build, eventually requiring a more disruptive policy
tightening and economic slowdown to achieve the same long-run inflation outcome. Aside
from the current level of resource utilization, the Committee may see significant upside risks
to inflation. Oil prices have remained stubbornly high, and the decline projected by the staff
may not materialize, eliminating a source of prospective price restraint and perhaps inducing
a ratcheting-up of inflation expectations. In addition, the restraint on aggregate demand put
in place by the Committee's prior tightenings has been offset to some extent by the recent
rally in capital markets, and prospective increases in productivity growth may boost wealth
and expected earnings even more than they have already, especially if real interest rates lie
below the higher marginal product of capital.
","alternative C"
2000-10-03,9,"(9) The FOMC instead might choose the 25 basis point increase in the federal
funds rate of alternative C. Core inflation has risen and may already be above rates that
Committee members find acceptable over the long run. Moreover, although underlying
trends in aggregate demand apparently have slowed, the current and projected levels of
resource utilization may imply, based on historical experience, a likelihood that core inflation
will continue to increase, as in the staff forecast. Furthermore, the Committee may see
upside risks to inflation even relative to that forecast. While the staff has trimmed the
amount of fiscal restraint in the outlook, recent news might be read as suggesting a distinct
possibility of even greater erosion in federal budget surpluses. In addition, if oil prices do
not fall as in the staff forecast and futures market quotes, short-term inflation expectations
may deteriorate further, which, absent monetary policy firming, would reduce the real federal
funds rate. In simulations of staff econometric models, such as that shown in the
international section of Part I of the Greenbook, holding the nominal funds rate along the
baseline path in the face of an upward shock to oil prices sets in motion a process of ever-
rising core inflation relative to the baseline outcome as lower real interest rates boost output
relative to potential.
","alternative C"
2000-11-15,9,"(9) Markets expect no adjustment in the funds rate at this meeting, but
participants appear to have somewhat diverse views about the Committee's choice of the
balance of risks. Thus, their reaction to the choice of alternative B will depend largely on
that balance assessment. Anecdotal reports suggest that most investors still anticipate a
statement of continued imbalance toward inflation risks, but a growing number do not and
market prices have built in a policy easing by early next year. In these circumstances, the
retention of an imbalance toward inflation risks at this meeting would induce market
participants to push back the timing of policy easings, causing bond and stock prices to
decline modestly. But prices would likely be bid up somewhat if balanced risks were chosen
because participants would see this choice as raising the possibility of a near-term reduction
in the target funds rate.
","alternative B"
2004-05-04,9,"(9) In light of the data released over the intermeeting period, the Committee
may feel more confident that vigorous output growth will be sustained and that slack
in labor markets will diminish.  Moreover, the higher-than-anticipated price data might
be taken as evidence that inflation has bottomed.  In these circumstances, the
Committee might want to adopt language that would provide more flexibility about
future action so that it has scope to begin unwinding its current policy
accommodation if circumstances soon warrant, as in Alternative B.  Even if such
action were not viewed as imminent, the Committee might favor a change in the
wording if members put some weight on the possibility of tightening in the next few
months as more information bearing on the strength of the labor market and inflation

seen as especially costly:  Even if somewhat stronger employment growth and a
slowing in the rate of advance of productivity pushed up labor costs, competitive
pressure may lead firms to trim currently high profit margins, limiting the pass-
through of rising costs to inflation.  And, while inflation compensation five to ten

changed little, on net, since last fall, suggesting that longer-term expectations remain

2004-08-10,9,"(9) Although the recent pace of economic growth has been less vigorous
than projected in the June Greenbook, the Committee may still judge that the
economy is poised for significant expansion going forward, as in the current staff
forecast.  Under this view, a gradual tightening of monetary policy should be
consistent with a pace of growth sufficient to make some headway in reducing
economic slack while keeping inflation well contained.  If the Committee subscribes
to such an outlook, it may find it appropriate to continue paring the degree of
monetary policy accommodation and thus be attracted to the 25-basis-point firming at
this meeting of Alternative B.  Policy likely will need to be firmed considerably over
time:  The real federal funds rate, measured as the difference between the nominal
funds rate and lagged four-quarter core PCE inflation, remains negative and below the
estimates of its equilibrium value implied by selected staff models (Chart 5).  And
given recent inflation trends, as well as the continued climb in crude oil prices in
recent weeks, a further tightening of policy might be viewed as desirable to reduce the
odds of an upturn in inflation expectations and more generally to help ensure that

core inflation does not rise above acceptable levels.  At the same time, the Committee
may believe that a gradual pace of policy adjustment will likely be sufficient to foster
achievement of its goals, particularly given the apparent persistence of economic slack,
which should help restrain inflation.  Also, the recent data may be read as hinting that
the sluggishness in spending of the past few months might prove more protracted
than forecast in the Greenbook, arguing for only a modest firming step at this
meeting.  Estimated policy rules generally suggest that a such a tightening at this
meeting would be consistent with the Committees past policy conduct (Chart 6).

2004-09-21,9,"(9) With regard to the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee could
again repeat the themes that the stance of policy remains accommodative even after
the policy move and that this stance, combined with strong trend productivity growth,
is supporting economic activity.  However, the Committee presumably will wish to
modify the next few sentences of the announcement to reflect the tenor of recent
data.  One way of updating the key points in the discussion of real-side developments
would be to hold that: After moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial
rise in energy prices, output appears to have regained some traction.  The pace of improvement in labor
market conditions, however, remains modest.  In view of the recent string of relatively
benign inflation reports, the Committee might also wish to indicate that Despite the rise

economic growth and price stability are roughly balanced.  And, as suggested above,
the newly available evidence would also seem consistent with a judgment that policy

2004-12-14,9,"(9) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committees consideration
(see Table 1).  Under Alternative B, the federal funds rate would rise 25 basis points,
but the statement would imply that the Committee saw a distinct possibility of a pause
in tightening at an upcoming meeting.  Alternative C also envisions a 25-basis-point
tightening, but the accompanying statement would give no indication that a pause was
likely.  In all three cases, the description of labor market conditions in the rationale
paragraph has been adjusted in light of the incoming data.  In Alternative A, the
federal funds rate would remain at 2 percent.  Similarly, under all three alternatives,
the Committee is assumed to retain both an assessment that the risks to its goals of
stable prices and maximum sustainable growth are balanced and the measured pace
language contained in the last several statements.
","Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative A"
2005-03-22,9,"(9) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committees consideration
that are summarized in Table 1, together with associated wording.  Under Alternative
B, the funds rate would be raised 25 basis points at this meeting.  The accompanying
statement would be quite similar to that issued following the February meeting but
would note that output continues to grow at a solid pace, that inflation pressures had
picked up, and that the rise in energy prices had not notably fed through to wages or
core consumer prices.  Alternative B makes the balance-of-risks assessment explicitly
conditional on appropriate policy and uses a more forceful verb phrase, should be
kept, to underscore that it may take policy action to preserve balance.3  As explained
in the box on the next page, several of the characterizations in that statement may
now or in the not-too-distant future be seen as needing revision in light of economic
developments.  As a case in point, the Committee may regard the current measured-
pace language as limiting its flexibility at this and subsequent meetings.  To allow for a
broader range of policy options, under Alternatives A and C, the measured-pace
language is replaced with a sentence emphasizing economic prospects as the principal
factor that will determine the pace at which policy accommodation is removed.  The
statement could point to upside risks to sustainable growth and price stability
conditional on an unchanged target federal funds rate for the next few quarters as an
additional way of signaling the likely direction of the path for policy.  Under
Alternative A, the funds rate also would be raised 25 basis points, but the 
                                           
3 The Committee has accompanied its six prior tightenings with assessments that the risks to 
both of its goals were balanced, which indicates that those assessments have implicitly been 
conditioned on an appropriate path of policy.  However, explicitly stating that conditionality, 
as in Alternative B, will probably limit the usefulness of this form of the risk assessment in 
signaling the likely direction of future policy moves.

Issues Associated with the 
FOMC Statement Language
The Committee will likely face five key issues 
concerning its statement language over upcoming 
meetings.  First, as noted in the markup of the February 
FOMC statement at the right, the Committee will need 
to determine whether its characterization of the stance 
of policymarked in redshould be modified in some 
way.  Second, as noted in blue, the FOMC may need to 
revise its assessment of the pace of underlying 
productivity growth in light of the realized and 
anticipated slowing in actual productivity growth.  
Third, the assessment of inflation and inflation 
expectationsnoted in greenmay need to be 
revisited.  Fourth, as marked in purple, the Committee 
may wish to alter the measured pace language.  This 
might be the case if the Committee judged that a pause 
in the process of removing policy accommodation 
might be called for or, alternatively, if it determined 
that economic circumstances warranted a more rapid 
policy adjustment.  However, eliminating the measured-
pace language without a replacement would leave the 
risk assessment paragraph without a signal about the 
future direction of policy.  That omission raises the 
fifth issuenoted in orangeregarding the balance-of-
risks assessment.

2005-05-03,9,"(9) Incoming data over the intermeeting period led the staff to reduce
significantly its projection for near-term growth of real activity, to nudge up its
forecast for inflation, and to mark down its assumption for the path of monetary
policy.  The federal funds rate is now assumed to reach 3¼ percent by mid-year and
to rise another 50 basis points by late 2006, a little less firming than currently built
into markets and 25 basis points less cumulative action than assumed in the March
Greenbook.  In the current forecast, long-term nominal interest rates are projected
to stay near current levels over the projection period, despite the assumed monetary
policy tightening, as investors come to recognize that less firming will be necessary
to contain inflation than they currently expect.  Equity prices are expected to
increase from their recent lower levels at a pace generating risk-adjusted returns in
line with yields on fixed-income instruments, and the nominal trade-weighted index
of the dollars value against major foreign currencies is assumed to fall at an
annualized rate of 2 percent.  The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is
forecast to be about flat on balance over the projection period and to finish 2006
close to $53 per barrel, approximately $3 above the level forecast in the March
Greenbook.  In these circumstances, real GDP is forecast to grow 3½ percent this
year and next, a bit above the staffs estimate of the expansion of potential output.
Nonetheless, resource slack persists over the forecast period, with the
unemployment rate holding at 5¼ percent (a little above the staffs estimate of the
natural rate of unemployment), in part as labor force participation rises in response
to improving job prospects.  With regard to inflation, the staff has read the sharp
jump in the core CPI in March in large measure as the result of factors that are
expected to have a much smaller effect on PCE prices.  With some economic slack
remaining, import prices rising less rapidly, and energy prices falling back somewhat
as margins shrink, core PCE inflation is forecast to slow a little over the next two

Committee.  The federal funds rate would be boosted 25 basis points at this meeting
under Alternatives A and B, and 50 basis points under Alternative C.  Apart from
updating the description of the current economic situation, the proposed
announcement associated with Alternative B is little changed from that issued after
the June meeting.  In contrast, the announcement accompanying Alternative A would
hint at a near-term slowing in the pace of policy tightening, in part by noting that
policy accommodation has been substantially reduced.  The proposed announcement
for Alternative C emphasizes the strength of aggregate spending, suggests that
pressures on business costs and inflation could be increasing, and eliminates all
forward-looking language.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining the
policy action and draft language from more than one alternative or view some of the
language options as possibilities for the future.

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Both draft
announcements refer to the adverse near-term effects on spending, production, and
employment of Hurricane Katrina.  (The box entitled Monetary Policy
Announcements and External Events summarizes the Committees past practice
with respect to mentioning significant exogenous events in its statements.)  The
announcements also refer to inflation pressures but indicate that core inflation has
been relatively low.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would leave its target for the
federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this meeting; the statement would
emphasize hurricane-related uncertainties and suggest that this was just a pause in the
tightening process.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would boost the target
macroeconomic effects of the hurricane are likely to be limited.  Because uncertainty
surrounding the economic outlook has risen considerably, this Bluebook also
considers ways of shading the language under Alternatives A and B to project more
distinct paths for policy.  Paragraph 13 considers changes to the statement language
(relative to Alternative B) that could express more concern about inflation.  In
contrast, paragraph 16 suggests wording changes to Alternative A that would be
consistent with an expectation of a more prolonged pause in firming.  Lastly, the box
at the end of this section entitled Opening Up the Statement examines fundamental
changes to the risk assessment that could be made to either Alternative A or B.

economic dislocations of the hurricanes and associated effects on consumer and

Committee would raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points.  Alternative B
retains much of the statement the Committee issued after its September meeting,

period, the choice of another 25 basis point firming at this meeting would be
consistent with the Committees indication in November that policy tightening can
likely proceed at a measured pace.  A policy firming of that dimension would also be
consistent with the staff forecast, in which modest further tightening is projected to
be sufficient to contain inflation and foster sustainable growth.  This Bluebooks
particular focus on the announcement is motivated by the Committees interest in
modifying its statement language before long, as evidenced by the considerable
discussion at the last meeting and the ensuing intermeeting survey of meeting
participants preferences for the announcement.  Under Alternative B, the form of the
assessment of risks would be modified notably, with the Committee indicating
explicitly a judgment that some further tightening would be necessary to keep the
risks to both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  By
contrast, Alternative C retains much of the form as well as important elements of the
content of the November FOMC statement, including the characterization of policy
as accommodative and the measured pace language.  However, the rationale section
of Alternative C would convey greater concerns about inflation than the comparable
portion of Alternative B.  As always, the Committee could choose to use the rationale
language from one alternative with the assessment of risks language from another, or
it could adopt different language altogether.

could help inform the Committees near-term policy choice.  To that end, staff
extended the basic features of the Greenbook outlook through 2010.  In that
extension, monetary policy adjusts to hold core PCE inflation at about 2 percent.  In
the absence of any significant supply shocks or changes in expectations, the
unemployment rate remains near the 5 percent staff estimate of the NAIRU.  The
associated medium-run value of the equilibrium real funds rate is about 2¾ percent,
which implies a modest step-down in the nominal funds rate to roughly 4¾ percent
after 2007.  With this as the baseline, the model can be used to simulate the effects of
alternative assumptions for monetary policy over the next few years.  In these
simulations, participants in financial marketsincluding those in the equity, bond,
and foreign exchange marketsare assumed to understand fully the forces shaping
the economic outlook, whereas households and firms are assumed to form their
expectations using more limited information.

Economic growth has moderated 
from its quite strong pace earlier 
this year, partly reflecting a cooling 
of the housing market.
Although core inflation remains elevated, 
recent readings have been slightly more 
favorable.  While some inflation 
pressures persist, they seem likely to 
moderate over time, reflecting reduced 
impetus from energy prices, contained 
inflation expectations, and the 
cumulative effects of monetary policy 
actions and other factors restraining

and B, the Committee would again leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at
this meeting; Alternative A would suggest that the Committee now sees the risks to
growth and inflation as balanced, while Alternative B would repeat the indication
from August that the Committee is concerned predominantly with inflation risks.
Under Alternative C, the Committee would firm policy 25 basis points and, as in
Alternative B, would highlight upside inflation risks.  A few key data releases are
scheduled between the publication of this document and the Committees meeting,
including consumer prices for August on Friday and housing starts on Tuesday, so the
wording of the rationale portions of the various draft statements should be viewed as
more tentative than usual.

1970-06-23,10,"(10) In this situation, the Committee may wish to consider three
alternative policy courses for the interval until its next meeting on July 21,
at which time ""even keel"" considerations are likely to become a factor
constraining operations. First, it may wish to continue the current
directive for another interval, emphasizing the objective of moderating
financial market pressures, with secondary attention to the monetary
aggregates. Second, it may wish to reestablish as its primary objective
the achievement of moderate growth in the monetary aggregates, along the
lines visualized at the May 5 and earlier meetings, with a proviso addressed
to countering any excessive pressures that may develop. Or the Committee,
in recognition of the somewhat weaker economic news and the prospect that
economic recovery over the next year may be more sluggish than was antici-
pated earlier, may wish to move policy toward the achievement of a moderately
faster rate of growth in money and bank credit than has prevailed in the
year to date, with a proviso similar to that of the preceding alternative.
Specificationsfor these three alternatives are discussed below.
Alternative A
","Alternative A"
1970-12-15,10,"(10) The range of money market conditions, as typified by
the Federal funds rate, that would be expected to be consistent over
the next few weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are
summarized below.
Annual rates of increase
in money supply
Federal funds rate 4th Qtr. 1st Qtr.
Alternative A 5--5-1/2 5% 5%
B 4-5/8--5-1/8 5% 67.
C 4-1/4--4-3/4 5% 77
Weekly figures for the aggregates between now and the next FOMC meeting
consistent with these paths are shown in the table on page 9.
","Alternative A"
1971-01-12,10,"(10) Under alternative B, the money market may have to be
eased from currently prevailing conditions; the funds rate was around
half of the 4--4-3/4 per cent range specified. The 3-month bill rate
would likely go into a 4--4-5/8 per cent range, but may not drop to the
lower end of the range unless the Federal funds rate falls to 4 per cent
or below for a sustained period of time. Under alternative C, which
would probably require a funds rate below 4 per cent, the bill rate might
also decline below 4 per cent, although expectations that rates were
bottoming out might tend to inhibit such a decline in the 3-month rate.
In either case, movements in the bill rate would be influenced by ex-
pectations as to future discount rate actions as well as by the nature of
forthcoming Treasury financings.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1971-02-09,10,"(10) Since the alternative B pattern of growth in monetary
aggregates involves a somewhat less rapid February--March annual growth
rate for M1 of 9 per cent, attainment of this rate would seem to
involve a smaller reduction in the Federal funds rate than under alterna-
tive A--perhaps a funds rate in a 3--3-1/2 per cent range--and a net free
reserve position of $50-$150 million. The accompanying drop in the 3-
month Treasury bill rate might be into a 3-1/4--3-3/4 per cent range.
Because of the more gradual approach to making up the shortfall in M1
under alternative B, a sizable later snapback in money market rates would
not be expected. Still, in early spring the Federal funds rate and the
bill rate might be somewhat above the upper end of these ranges as reserves
are adjusted to bring growth in M1 onto a 7 per cent growth path for the
second quarter as a whole.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1971-03-09,10,"(10) The table on the next page shows three alternative monthly
paths extending throughout the second quarter for the major monetary aggregates.
Alternative A assumes a Federal funds rate maintained at 3-1/2 per cent--that
is, it assumes current money market conditions. Thus, it is an extension
through June of the current paths described in the preceding paragraphs.
While it is particularly difficult at this juncture to judge the implications
for succeeding months of the recent sharp rise in the monetary aggregates, it
is our best current judgment that the extension of these paths would lead to
annual rates of growth in the second quarter of 9 per cent for M1, 14-1/2 per
cent for M2, 11 per cent for the adjusted credit proxy, and 10 per cent for
total reserves. The other two sets of paths presented are designed to indicate
alternatives for the Committee that call for slower growth rates in the
aggregates than now seem probable under unchanged money market conditions.
Alternative B, for instance, shows a 7 per cent annual rate of growth for M1
over the second quarter and alternative C a 6 per cent rate of increase. A
fourth alternative designed to focus on an objective of achieving somewhat
easier over-all credit market conditions is presented in paragraphs (18) and
","Alternative A, Alternative B, alternative C"
1971-07-27,10,"(10) The money market specifications for alternative A represent
a continuation of conditions recently prevailing, as would be consistent with
a strict interpretation of ""even keel"". The current Treasury refunding will be
settled on August 16, only about a week before the next FOMC meeting. It is
possible also that conditions following the settlement date will present more
than the usual constraint on open market operations in view of the greater price
risk in the distribution process of a long-term offering. Specifications for
alternative B, on the other hand, would envisage a gradual firming of the
money market, to the extent permitted by the Treasury financing, to a Federal
funds rate of 6 per cent by late in the inter-meeting period; a funds rate
fluctuating around 6 per cent has been assumed for the alternative B paths
for the monetary aggregates.

1971-08-24,10,"(10) The text table that follows specifies: (1) the growth path
for M1 thought to be consistent with the unchanged Federal funds rate
assumption of alternative A; and (2) the funds rate thought to be needed
to achieve the 6 per cent annual growth rate in M1 (for the third and

1971-10-19,10,"(10) Our best present estimate is that under the money market
conditions of alternative A, M1 will grow in the first quarter of next
year at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate following the 2-1/2 per cent rate
indicated for the fourth quarter. Under the easing alternatives, money
growth would accelerate more as lower interest rates themselves tended to
increase the public's demand for cash. For alternative B, the annual rate of
money growth rises from 3 per cent in the fourth quarter to 6 per cent in the
first quarter,.andfor alternative C from a 4 per cent annual rate to a
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1971-11-16,10,"(10) Under alternative A/B, we would expect the 3-month bill
rate to be in a 4--4-5/8 per cent range between now and mid-December.
The bill rate could rise from recent levels in response to normal seasonal
pressures, particularly in view of the current wide spread of the funds
rate above the bill rate. In addition, the Treasury is expected to raise
$3 billion of new cash in the bill area in late November. The Treasury
will have to raise another $2--$3 billion of cash before year-end, but
it seems likely at this point that this operation will not be undertaken
until late December. Sizable sales of bills by foreign central banks in the
event of reflows of funds from abroad would also tend to exert pressure
on the bill market. Under alternative C, however, short-term interest
rates would almost certainly decline over the period ahead, with the bill
rate likely to be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1972-05-23,10,"(10) The demand for money is expected to remain strong largely
because of the substantial 11--11-1/2 per cent annual rate of growth projected
for nominal GNP in the second and third quarters. Both rates of growth are
larger than projected by the staff at the last FOMC meeting. With sizable
transactions demands, efforts to move onto a slower growth path for monetary
aggregates--as in alternatives B and C--are likely to involve additional upward
pressures on short-term interest rates, with such pressures particularly strong
under alternative C. In June and July, the projected sharp drop in the Treasury
balance will tend temporarily to accelerate growth in M1. This reflects pushing
forward by one month the sharp drop in the Treasury balance that had been
anticipated for May but did not develop.
","alternative C"
1972-06-19,10,"(10) As the third quarter progresses, growth in time deposits
other than large CD's is expected to slow, reflecting rising short-term
market interest rates. The slowdown does not look as if it will be as
sharp as we had earlier expected in view of the strong performance of
such deposits in recent weeks and the failure of short-term market rates
thus far to show significant increases. Even so, M2 is projected to grow
more slowly in the third quarter than in the second under alternatives B
and C, and at just about the same rate under alternative A.
","alternative A"
1972-07-18,10,"(10) With respect to money and short-term market conditions,
the staff's best current estimate is that the Federal funds rate will need
to move up from the recent 4-1/2--4-5/8 per cent range--given rising trans-
action demands for cash associated with expansion in GNP--in attaining the
reserve path and aggregates of alternatives B or C, with a more pronounced
rise likely under alternative C. However, bill rates may not increase
much, and under some circumstances could decline, over the next few weeks.
The Government's near-term cash needs remain relatively small. Moreover,
the recent pattern of dollar outflows, if continued, will increase potential
foreign demand for bills. Between now and the next meeting of the Committee
a 3-month bill rate in a 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent range might be anticipated
under conditions of alternative B, assuming the funds rate in that
alternative does not move much, if any, above 4-3/4 per cent.
","alternative C, alternative B"
1972-10-17,10,"(10) to
(7) The longer-run targets under alternative A are indexed by an
M1 annual growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the fourth and first quarters.
We would expect that there may be only a modest further rise in short-term
interest rates in the fourth quarter under this alternative. In the first
quarter, with the rate of increase in nominal GNP projected to continue strong
and with large contra-seasonal Treasury cash borrowing anticipated, short-term
rates seem likely to rise more rapidly. The timing of interest rate movements
cannot, of course, be predicted with any certainty. It is always possible,
for example, that sizable foreign central bank transactions may affect the bill
market. Also, interest rates could rise substantially late this year as the
market anticipated heavy Treasury first quarter credit demands. On balance, one
might anticipate a 3-month Treasury bill rate rising to a 5-1/2--5-3/4 per cent
area by the end of the first quarter.
(8) Under alternatives B and C (indexed by 6 per cent and 5 per
cent annual rates of growth in M1, respectively) the staff would expect upward

pressure on short-term interest rates to emerge sooner and to carry rates to
higher levels than under alternative A. It is likely that Treasury bill rates
by some time in early 1973 would move above ceiling rates on consumer-type
time deposits (for which the highest rate is 5-3/4 per cent on 2-year and over
maturities), thus raising the odds on a substantial slowing in time deposit
inflows to banks by late in the first quarter. As a result, M2 growth,
particularly under alternative C, is targeted to slow more than M1 growth.
Net inflows to nonbank savings institutions, whose ceiling rates on time
certificates are 1/4 percentage point higher than banks, would also come
under pressure, though not importantly perhaps until the second quarter.
(9) In long-term markets, credit demand pressures from private
sectors are expected to remain moderate into the winter. However, given its
large cash needs, the Treasury seems likely to tap all possible sources,
including the bond market, to satisfy its financing requirements. In general,
though, long-term markets are most vulnerable to upward rate pressures from
the supply of funds side. The institutional supply of funds would likely be
constrained under alternative C, and to a smaller degree under B. And as
interest rates began to rise, there might be some temporary investor withdrawal
from long-term commitments of funds.

1972-12-19,10,"(10) Of the alternatives presented, alternative C--which encompasses
a 5 per cent M1 target for the first half of 1973--does involve a slowing of
M1 growth that eventually compensates for recent overshoots. Because of
factors affecting money demand, the slowing of M1 growth is indicated to be
most marked in the second quarter. In that period, money demand is expected
to be moderated by disappearance of the transitory upward effect on M 1 of
unusually large tax refunds in late winter and early spring. In addition,
demand for money would be reduced,with a lag, by the substantial rise of
interest rates indicated for that alternative. It is thought that attainment
of the alternative C aggregate targets would be accompanied by a rise in the
Federal funds rate to around 6 per cent over the next few weeks, with perhaps
some modest further increase developing later in the winter.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1973-01-16,10,"(10) Alternative B shown in paragraph (8) encompasses longer-
run paths for the aggregates that include a 5--6 per cent annual rate of
growth for M1, the longer-run target specified by the Committee at its
last meeting. Alternative A provides for somewhat more rapid growth in
the aggregates and alternative C for somewhat less.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, alternative C"
1973-05-15,10,"(10) Between now and the next Committee meeting the 3-month
Treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6-1/4--6-5/8 per cent
range under alternative B. The recent rise in the discount rate and the
somewhat tauter money market conditions anticipated will put pressure on
dealer financing costs and will also give banks a further incentive to sell
or liquidate bills as compared with other forms of adjustment. In addition,
a $1--$2 billion drop in the Treasury balance at the Fed is anticipated prior
to mid-June tax receipts and this will cause the System to sell more bills
than otherwise into the market. The bill rate is still expected to remain
unusually low relative to the funds rate, however. The Treasury's favorable
cash position has enabled it to pay down maturing coupon issues and bills, and
the Treasury has also stressed debt lengthening in its refunding operations.
In this assessment of the bill market, we have not assumed any substantial
reflow of funds from abroad.
","alternative B"
1973-06-18,10,"(10) The combined third and fourth quarter rates of growth required
to hit the longer-run targets specified for M1 amount to 5-1/2 per cent for
alternative A; 4-1/2 per cent for alternative B; and 3 per cent for alter-
native C. These are the rates of growth which would attain a December level
that is on the desired long-run growth path after correcting for the recent
overshoot. If the June level of M1 turns out to be lower or higher than
presently projected, the growth rates to reach the desired path level of M1
in December would, of course, be revised commensurately. Targets for the
other monetary aggregates consistent with those for M1, and associated
short-run ranges of tolerance for June-July, are summarized in the table

1973-09-18,10,"(10) Alternative B falls in between A and C in terms of growth in
the aggregates. It also implies a smaller drop in interest rates than does
alternative A. The 6-month growth rate for M1 under this alternative is
around 4-1/2 per cent at an annual rate. Thus, like C, it would represent
a path that falls short of the Committee's previous long-run target, but
of course the shortfall is less.
","Alternative B, alternative A"
1973-10-16,10,"(10) RPD growth for October-November of course becomes larger
the easier are the policy alternatives. While the differences in RPD
growth in the short-run are modest, the differences in growth of non-
borrowed reserves are larger in order to compensate, under the easier
alternatives, for the further drop in member bank borrowings that would
be envisaged. The unchanged money market conditions of alternative C
encompass a Federal funds rate centered in a 9-1/2--10-1/2 per cent range
and member bank borrowings that fluctuate around $1.5 billion. To attain
the aggregates specified under B, the Federal funds rate would be expected
to decline toward the lower part of the 8-3/4--1-l/4 per cent range
indicated, and average member bank borrowings may decline to around
$1.3 billion. Under A, the funds rate could drop considerably further
to around 8 per cent and member bank borrowings to around $1 billion.
However, it has become very difficult in recent weeks to anticipate shifts
in member bank demands for borrowing as market conditions change, and
these estimates of borrowing could even be a bit on the high side.
","alternative C"
1973-12-17,10,"(11) The greater decline in the funds rate under alternative A,
as compared with B, would intensify market expectations of declining
interest rates. If the funds rate were to drop rapidly and to fall below
a little lower, at least temporarily. Market expectations of a decline in
the discount rate would become much more prevalent.

1974-02-20,10,"(10) Alternative B includes the 5¾ per cent annual growth rate
for M1 for the period from December to June adopted by the Committee at its
last meeting, which is depicted in the chart on the following page. The
longer-run growth of M2 implied by this alternative is around 10 per cent,
about 2 percentage points higher than indicated at the last Committee
meeting. 1/ The increase in M2 growth reflects the greater than expected
strength of recent net inflows of consumer-type time deposits at banks and
the lower average level of market interest rates that has already developed
and is assumed to continue into the months ahead under this alternative.

1974-04-15,10,"(10) Alternative B calls for somewhat more rapid growth in the
monetary aggregates over the second and third quarters, typified by a 6 per
cent growth rate for M 1 . The B growth rates seem obtainable with little
further significant change in money market conditions and short-term
interest rates, in light of the sharp increases in short-term rates that
have already occurred during the past two months. Thus, the Federal funds
rate under this alternative centers around 10 per cent. The still more
rapid longer-run growth rates of alternative A--including a 6¾ per cent
rate for M 1 over the second and third quarters--appear likely to be
associated with declines in both short- and long-term interest rates.

rate range. The funds rate centers on 12 per cent, which would represent
an easing from the money market conditions prevailing over the past two
weeks. Such a funds rate would probably lead to some relaxation in
pressures on short- and long-term markets, partly because investors and
borrowers would come to believe that monetary policy was a little less
restrictive than had appeared to be the case in the most recent weeks.
Any drop in market rates is likely to be modest in size and short-lived,
however, given the inflationary environment, continued strong credit
demands, and the forthcoming Treasury, Federal Financing Bank, and Agency
financings (both to raise cash and to refund maturing issues). Large
demands for U.S. securities by foreign official accounts, of course, could
modify this rate outlook appreciably in particular market sectors.
","alternative B"
1974-08-20,10,"(10) Under alternative B, and given the recent slowing in
money growth, the staff expects that the Federal funds rate may decline
a little further between now and the next meeting--centering around
to more than a quite modest downward adjustment in other market rates.
Demand pressures on credit markets are expected to be fairly well
sustained in the weeks ahead, as a sizable volume of corporate, municipal,
and Federal agency offerings come to market. The Treasury will probably
borrow another $2 billion or so of cash in early September, possibly
through tax bills, over and above ongoing additions to the weekly bill
auctions. While this flow of new securities would work to limit down-
ward rate adjustments, a sizable expectational decline in rates could
take place if a further downdrift in the funds rate were accompanied by
continued slow growth in the monetary aggregates and adverse business news.
","alternative B"
1974-10-14,10,"(10) The additional declines in interest rates expected under
alternative B may involve a further easing in the 3-month commercial paper
rate to the 9-9½ per cent range, compared with around 9¾ per cent currently,
The 3-month Treasury bill should continue to fluctuate very widely--say,
in a 6-8 per cent range--and may average a bit below 7 per cent, although
very large additions to the supply of bills in the days immediately ahead
would likely exert upward pressure on the rate. As short-term market rates
ease off, some pick-up in net inflows of time deposits other than money
market CD's at banks are to be expected, and the position of thrift institu-
tions may show some improvement. Growth rates of 7½ and 6¼ per cent,
respectively, are expected for M2 and M3 over the fourth and first quarters,
up from the relatively low third quarter growth rates of 4-5 per cent.
","alternative B"
1974-12-16,10,"(10) Alternatives C and B involve growth rates of M1 of 6
and 6½ per cent, respectively, through the first half of next year.
Under alternative B the level of M1 by June is the same as that obtained
by extending the 5¾ per cent August-March growth path to June. This
alternative is consistent with the basic chart show projection, which
assumes the same catch-up in M1 growth and also assumes continuation of
the 5 per cent basic M1 growth path throughout the chart show projection
period (to mid-1976). Under alternative C, the catch-up period would
extend into the fall.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1975-01-20,10,"(10) The specifications of alternative B contemplate a smaller
decline in the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks than under
alternative A. The mid-point of the suggested range is around 6¾ per
cent. Money supply growth over the first half of 1975 would be
expected to be at about a 6 per cent annual rate, and would be at about
a 5½ per cent annual rate of growth over the Nov. '74--June '75 period.
Because alternative B puts in place a lesser degree of monetary stimula-
tion over the near-term, it would appear that any reversal of the interest
rate decline would be delayed more than under alternative A. In order to
prevent an acceleration of monetary growth in the second half of 1975, the
funds rate under this alternative would probably not need to rise until
perhaps early summer. However, market interest rates more generally could
begin rising in spring in anticipation of continued exceptionally large
Treasury cash needs in the second half of the year combined with a pick-up
of total private credit demands (assuming that an economic recovery in
the second half is still anticipated at that time).
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1975-02-19,10,"(10) Given the January shortfall in M1 and the sharply weaker
economy now projected by the staff for the first and second quarters
of this year, we would expect it to be necessary for the Federal funds
rate to decline to around the middle of a 4-5 per cent range between now
and mid-March if the growth in the aggregates as shown under alternative
A were to be attained. Some further decline in the funds rate might be
needed by early spring.
","alternative
A"
1975-03-18,10,"(10) Under alternative A, a further decline in the Federal
funds rate to around 5 per cent--the mid-point of the 4½-5½ per cent
range shown--would be anticipated over the next few weeks. This reflects
staff expectations of continued near-term weakness in economic activity
and in the transactions demand for money during the second quarter. There-
after, without any further decline in the Federal funds rate, the sharp
rebound in economic activity projected for the third quarter is expected
to lead to a rapid rate of growth in M1 during the summer--large enough
to bring growth for the first nine months of the year up to a 6 per cent
annual rate. Given the rapid summer growth needed to attain a 6 per cent
rate over the nine month period, the funds rate and other interest rates
would likely need to rise fairly sharply in the late summer and fall if
the Committee wishes to maintain M1 growth in the period after September
at around the 6 per cent annual rate.

aggregate growth as the year progresses. Alternative A, which contemplates
a near-term easing of money market conditions, and an 8 per cent rate of growth
in M1 over the second and third quarters, would imply a considerable
turn-around of interest rates later this year if growth in the aggregates
over the 12-month period is to be kept at around the mid-points of the
indicated longer-term ranges, assuming the GNP projection is correct.
Alternative B implies a somewhat smaller rise in interest rates later.
Alternative C involves rising interest rates over the near-term, lower growth
in the monetary aggregates in the second and third quarters, and hence less
upward interest rate pressure later.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-06-16,10,"(10) As an operating guide for the intermeeting period under
alternative B, the short-run specifications include a rise in the Federal
funds rate to a range centered on 6 per cent. Given the substantial
second half of calendar 1975, this alternative assumes that a tightening
up on bank reserve and money market conditions over the near-term would

be necessary if growth in the monetary aggregates is to be constrained
in an environment of rising incomes and transactions demands. Even if
the funds rate rises in the weeks ahead to around 6 per cent, staff
projections are that M1 growth over the second half of this year is
likely to be on the order of 7 per cent, annual rate, assuming no further
increases in the funds rate until late in the period.
","alternative B, alternative a"
1975-07-15,10,"(10) In the table on p. 6a, under alternative B, the one-year
growth rate for M1 from June '75 to June '76 is shown as 5¾ per cent--
which is ½ point below the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent target range.
The staff used such a rate in the alternative B calculations because
the substantial overshoot in M1 growth during June raised the base
level for that month by about $1.7 billion above the estimate made
at the previous FOMC meeting. Over the 12-month period from June 1975 to
June 1976, M1 would therefore have to grow about per cent less than
indicated earlier if the Committee wished to ensure that the June overshoot
did not permanently raise the money supply. The long-run growth rate under
alternative B measured on a quarterly average basis--that is, from the
average level for M1 in the second quarter of 1975 to the average level in the
second quarter of 1976--is around 6¾ per cent, as is also shown in the table.
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1975-08-19,10,"(10) Alternative A is also consistent with a longer-run
strategy that would allow growth in M1 near the top of the 5--7-1/2 per
cent target range. In this case, however, some delay is envisaged
in moving to limit monetary growth, in order to avoid near-term
money market tightening while the economy is still in the beginnings
of recovery. Holding money market conditions about unchanged for the
present, however,would probably require a more aggressive tightening
later on, after the recovery gathers momentum. Therefore, the staff
believes that this strategy would imply somewhat higher money market
rates early in 1976 than under alternative B.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1975-11-18,10,"(10) With bond volume in the corporate and municipal markets
expected to be generally moderate, longer-term market interest rates are
likely to show little further net change between now and year-end under the
specifications of alternative B. If the New York situation is resolved
without default, yields in the municipal market could well show significant
declines. Primary mortgage market yields are likely to edge down over the
period ahead in lagged reaction to earlier declines in short-term interest
rates and corporate bond yields, and in light of a continued relatively
comfortable inflow of savings funds to thrift institutions.
","alternative B"
1976-01-20,10,"(10) The M1 level for QIII '76 that is implied by the Committee's
current longer-run growth range probably should be adjusted downward,
however, on economic grounds to allow for recent shifts of business funds
from demand deposits into savings accounts and for expected future growth
of such accounts at the expense of demand deposits. The regulatory change
permitting businesses to hold savings accounts up to $150,000 in size
became effective in mid-November. By early January such accounts aggregated
about $2 billion, of which the staff estimates that about $1½ billion would
otherwise have gone into demand deposits. Growth in business savings
accounts has been slowing in recent weeks, and the staff expects it to slow
further as time goes on; by the third quarter of 1976, additional growth in
such accounts substituting for demand deposits might total $1 billion. In
sum then, a $2½ billion downward adjustment in the target level of M1 for
the third quarter might be a reasonable allowance for corporate savings
accounts. This would imply M1 growth over the next three quarters at close
to a 6¼ per cent annual rate, which is approximately the growth rate for
that period under alternative B. For the one year QIII '75-QIII '76 period,
the path contained in alternative B involves M1 growth of 5.3 per cent.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1976-02-17,10,"(10) M2 growth in the February-March period under alternative
B is likely to be in a 10 to 13 per cent annual rate range. The rate of
growth in time and savings deposits (other than large CD's) may moderate
over the next few weeks from its recent exeptionally rapid pace, partly
in consequence of withdrawals in connection with payment for the new 8 per
cent 7-year Treasury note. A further slowing in such deposit flows can be
expected as the year progresses in view of the anticipated rise in
short-term market interest rates.
","alternative
B"
1976-03-15,10,"(10) Alternatives A and C call for an easing and tightening
of the money market, respectively, in the period before the next
Committee meeting. Through the summer months, alternative A would
encourage somewhat more growth in M1 and M2, and alternative C less.than
would alternative B. But if M1 and M2 are to grow over the year. from
QIV '75 to QIV '76 at rates near the mid-points of their respective one-
year ranges, the near-term declines in interest rates anticipated under
alternative A would be short-lived, and rates would begin rising, perhaps
by late spring. We have assumed that under alternative A the funds rate
would average about 6¾ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976. On the
other hand, the greater near-term restraint of alternative C would mean
that more monetary expansion would be required later in 1976 to achieve the
Committee's longer-run targets. Under this alternative, interest rates
would be likely to cease rising in late summer, with the funds rate
leveling out at around 6 per cent.
","alternative A, alternative C, alternative B, alternative A, alternative A, alternative C"
1976-04-20,10,"(10) If the funds rate stays around the mid-point of its
alternative B range over the next four weeks, short- and longer-term interest
rates are unlikely to change significantly. On April 28, the Treasury will
be announcing its mid-May refunding of some $4 billion of publicly-held
maturing debt. The Treasury may also raise about $1 -2 billion of new cash
at the same time. It is possible that a longer-term bond as well as a note
in the 7-10 year maturity area may be included in the offering. While the
volume of corporate and municipal bond offerings appears to be dropping
off from its exceptional March pace, the forward calendar remains high,
and substantial longer-term offerings by the Treasury could exert some
upward pressure on bond yields.
","alternative B"
1976-08-17,10,"(10) Under alternative B, M1 is expected to expand in a 4-8 per
cent, annual rate, range over the August-September period and M2 in a
in September than in August, in part because of a sharp drop in Treasury
balances. These balances have built up substantially in August, reflecting
the unexpectedly large amount of net new money raised in the recent
Treasury financing operation.
","alternative B"
1976-11-16,10,"(10) Alternative C involves a tightening in the money market
over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to around 5½ per cent
by the time of the next Committee meeting. With such an early effort to
restrain growth in the aggregates, we would expect that little, if any,
further tightening would be required later.
","Alternative C"
1977-02-15,10,"(10) A considerably slower growth in monetary aggregates would
be required in the second half of 1977 than in the first half if growth
over the year is to be around the mid-points of the longer-run ranges
adopted at the previous Committee meeting. Growth in the aggregates
would probably slow to some extent as a natural reaction to the sharp
expansion in money that is likely to accompany rebate payments. To
achieve the amount of slowing needed, however, it is very likely that
short-term interest rates will have to rise as the year progresses, given
the projected expansion in nominal GNP over the year. Under alternative
B, the staff would expect the Federal funds rate to begin rising in the
spring and reach around 6½ per cent by the fourth quarter of this year.
","alternative
B"
1977-04-19,10,"(10) M2 growth under alternative B is expected to be in an
expand at about a 9¼ per cent annual rate from the first to second
quarter. Time and savings deposits other than large CD's are expected
to expand over the next few weeks at close to their recent pace, given
a Federal funds rate around the mid-point of a 4¼-5¼ per cent range.
","alternative B"
1977-06-21,10,"(10) Given this background, and assuming that Federal funds
continue to trade at around 5-3/8 per cent as contemplated under
alternative B, it seems probable that short-term rates will remain
close to current levels in the near term. However, there might well be
some backup in long-term rates in the aftermath of the recent rally that
carried corporate and municipal yields to around their lowest levels in
several years.
","alternative B"
1977-08-16,10,"(10) Growth in M-2 over the August-September period under
alternative B is expected to be in a 4 -8 per cent annual rate range.
The time and savings deposit component of M-2 is likely to expand at
about an 8¼ per cent annual rate over the period, well below the June-
July average. The higher level of interest rates on short- and

rate, range. A relatively rapid growth appears to be in train for October,
given data thus far available for the month. The mid-point of the October-

(which would represent a pattern similar to last year's), and is consistent
with growth in M-1 from the third to the fourth quarter at about a 6 per
cent annual rate. Such a moderation in M-1 growth from the advanced
rates of the past two quarters is likely as a result of the lagged effect
on money demand of the rise of about 1¼ percentage points in short-term
rates that has occurred since mid-year.

1977-11-15,10,"(10) Growth in M-2 over the November-December period is likely
to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under Alternative B. The
time and savings deposit component of M-2 under this alternative is
expected to continue to expand at near its recent pace. Although savings
deposits at commercial banks are likely to continue growing relatively
slowing over the near-term as interest sensitive depositors shift to
higher yielding assets, time deposits at banks, especially those not
subject to Regulation Q ceiling, are expected to grow at a relatively
rapid rate. In addition, shifting of maturing wildcard accounts from
banks to thrifts will no longer be a depressant on commercial bank time
deposit growth, as seems to have been the case during the third quarter.

annual rate range. However, the staff expects that further increases
in market interest rates will be required relatively soon in order to
limit growth in this aggregate over the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period to
the mid-point of the longer-run 4 to 6½ per cent range associated with
alternative B. Money demand can be expected to be relatively strong over
the year. Nominal GNP is projected to increase at about an 11¾ per cent
rate during 1978, reflecting in part an assumed additional fiscal stimulus
from tax cuts. And the restraining effect of the previous increases in
interest rates will be diminishing with the passage of time. Moreover,
the evidence of the last three quarters suggests that the depressing
effect on money demand of regulatory and innovational factors has been
wearing off. Consequently, the staff has assumed only some moderate
additional downward shift in the demand for money over 1978. Thus, in

1978-04-18,10,"(10) Even if growth in M-1 and M-2 were at the mid-points
of their ranges over the year ahead, growth in these aggregates over
more extended periods ending in QI '79 would--because of the
relatively rapid rates of expansion of the aggregates in 1977--be
above the mid-points of the proposed ranges under each alternative.
For example, as shown in the table below, M-1 growth at around the
QI '79 period would lead to a 6.3 per cent annual rate of expansion
over the 24-month period starting in the first quarter of 1977, almost
quarters at around the 5 per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative
C range would still imply M-1 growth over the 24-month period
beginning in QI '77 at a rate well above the mid-point of the current
FOMC range.

1978-09-19,10,"(10) Expansion in M-2 under alternative A is likely to be in
an 8 to 12 per cent annual rate range over the September-October period,
raising this aggregate by October to the level implied by the top of
its current longer-run range, as shown in the top panel of Chart 2.
The interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to slow markedly from
its recent pace as the year progresses. However, given the strength of
time and savings deposits thus far in September, growth over the September-
October period in the time deposit component of M-2 may be at around an
first half of the year. Savings deposit growth is not likely to be sus-
tained at the August pace, but issuance of 6-month certificates should
support growth of small time deposits and banks are expected to con-
tinue to sell sizable amounts of large-denomination time deposits to
meet loan demands.
","alternative A"
1978-10-17,10,"(10) The demand for transactions balances is expected to
remain quite strong over the new QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period,
with nominal GNP projected to rise at almost an 11 per cent annual
rate. Thus, a further rise in the Federal funds rate appears needed
under alternatives B and C if growth in the aggregates is to be held
within their ranges. Even under alternative A, some further increase in
the funds rate might well be required. Staff projections of the funds
rate for each alternative are shown in appendix I.

now and the January meeting centered in the prevailing 9¾ to 10 per

what in December, on a daily average basis, but the evident growth of
income and expenditures suggests that a substantial increase in M-1 is
likely in January. Consequently, growth in this aggregate over the

December-January period is projected to be in a 2½ to 7½ per cent

to depress M-1 growth over the two-month period by 2 to 4 percentage
points, a bit less than previously assumed.
","Alternative A"
1979-02-06,10,"(10) Alternative B is based on the FOMC's current
expectation that M-1 growth over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period
would be around the upper limit of a 4 to 6½ per cent range in the
absence of new transactions accounts, such as ATS. At its October
meeting, the Committee expected that M-1 growth over the longer-run
would be in a 2 to 6 per cent range, which allows for a potential
downward effect on M-1 from ATS of 1/2 to 4-1/2 percentage points.
On the basis of experience gained with ATS and NOW accounts in
New York since that time, the staff believes that it is now rea-
sonable to assume that growth in such accounts will reduce M-1
growth over the QIV'78 to QIV '79 period from what it other-
1/
wise would have been by 3 to 3-1/2 percentage points. Given
that assumption, alternative B proposes a 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent
range for M-1; this range assumes--unlike recent M-1 ranges--that
the more likely growth of M-1 is at the mid-point rather than near
the upper end.1/ The range is narrower than that adopted in October
but remains a little wider than earlier M-1 ranges to reflect some
continued uncertainty about ATS effects. Alternatives A and C are
more and less expansive, respectively. Proposed ranges for the
broader aggregates have been lowered, for reasons discussed in
paragraphs (13) and (14) below.

implied by the lower ends of their longer-run ranges. This is also true for
alternatives A and C. The shortfall of growth in these aggregates since
late last year requires that M-1 would have to expand at about an 8 per
cent annual rate from March, and M-2 at an 11 per cent rate, to reach
levels by May that are on the low end paths of the longer-run QIV '78 to
QIV '79 ranges. Over a period as long as six months (March to September) the

shortfall could be made up, and the level implied by the midpoint path of
the longer-run ranges could be achieved, by M-1 growth at a 6 per cent annual
rate and M-2 growth at a 9 per cent rate. Unless the downward shift in
money demand continues to be very strong, or the economy weakens much
more than projected, the staff believes that M-1 is likely to move into the
Committee's longer-run range by late summer, given the current Federal
funds rate.
","alternative B"
1979-05-22,10,"(10) As illustrated in the upper panel of the chart on page 10,
the April increase in M-1 raised the level of that aggregate to just above
the low end path of its longer-run QIV '78 to QIV '79 range. Growth in
M-1 at the lower end of its projected May-June alternative B range would
place the level of this aggregate by June around the lower limit of its
longer-run range while growth at the upper end of the range would move the
aggregate higher in the range, though not quite to the midpoint. (The
table on p. 11 shows growth rates from April required to achieve levels
implied by the FOMC's longer-run ranges).
","alternative B"
1979-08-14,10,"(10) Under alternative B, M-2 growth is projected to expand at
about a 10 percent annual rate during the August-September period, a some-
what slower growth rate than in June and July. In addition to the
slowing in growth of the M-1 component, it is unlikely that savings
deposits will continue to expand at their recent rate, given the high level
of market interest rates. Nonetheless, growth in small time deposits should
remain brisk, with banks continuing to attract a substantial amount of MMC
deposits in the absence of an inter-institutional ceiling rate differential.

1979-09-18,10,"(10) Under alternative B, M-1 in October would be considerably
above the level implied by the upper end of the Committee's stated 1½ to 4½

May-June growth in these aggregates would have to accelerate to about a

for this volatile series. Even though real GNP is expected to decline
significantly this quarter, the rate of increase in nominal GNP is still
projected at over an 8 percent annual rate, suggesting a need for appreciable
growth in transactions balances.1/ However, given the restraining effects
on money demanded of past increases in interest rates, and with real economic
activity apparently slowing significantly, the May-June increases in M-1A
and M-1B required under alternative B may lead to a decline in the federal
funds rate to the 16 to 17 percent area, or perhaps even lower, over the

approach to operations between now and the next meeting, may wish to
consider policies that recognize the high probability of a shortfall in
growth of the aggregates over the first half of the year and that aim to
get the aggregates back on path over a longer period. Two such alternatives
are presented below, and depicted in the charts on the following pages.
Alternative A is designed to achieve a level of M-1A in December equal
to that implied by the midpoint growth path of the 3½ to 6 percent range
for this aggregate over the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period. Alternative B
is designed to return M-1A to the midpoint path by September. Growth in
M-2 would follow similar patterns. (More detailed specifications, with
implied rates of growth over various time periods, are shown in the

1980-09-16,10,"(10) Under alternative A, the expansion in M-A over the
balance of the year at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate would produce growth
over the one-year QIV '79 to QIV '80 policy period of 4-1/2 percent,
just below the midpoint of the Committee's 3-1/2 to 6 percent range. The
gap between growth in M-1B and M-1A over the balance of the year is
expected to be considerably wider than the 1/2 point implicit in the
Committee's longer-run targets, though narrower than the experience of
summer when growth in NOW and ATS accounts accelerated in response to the
same factors leading to a resurgence of savings deposits. From August to
December, M-1B under alternative A is expected to expand at a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate, leading to growth for the year at the upper limit of its range.

1980-11-18,10,"(10) To achieve the specifications of alternative B, total reserves

a 1 percent annual rate if the level of adjustment borrowing is around
required reserves associated with the substantial reduction of weekend
Eurodollar arbitrage activities.

$1¾ billion and by more if the level of borrowing rises further. However,
the exact setting on the nonborrowed reserve operating path will depend
in part on bank responses to the new discount rate structure. If past
experience with the surcharge is any guide, banks are likely to become
less willing borrowers, thereby reducing the level of borrowing for any
given spread of the funds rate over the basic discount rate. However,
earlier experience with the surcharge was within the context of a bank
credit restraint program,and bank behavior may differ under current circum-
stances. Thus, there is more than usual uncertainty about the demand for
borrowing, and therefore about the level of the nonborrowed reserve path
consistent with money supply and total reserve targets of alternative B.

alternatives M-2 would probably be above the upper end of its range in June,
and might well remain above the range over the balance of the year (assuming
M-1B growth at its midpoint rate for the year as a whole). Alternative C is
designed to increase the odds of constraining M-2 growth to within its
longer-run range for 1981. This would appear to involve growth in M-1B.
for the year at the lower end of its longer-run range, and alternative
C specifies such a trajectory for M-1B. The three strategies thus not only
imply options for how rapidly the Committee wishes to target a return of

place on obtaining an M-2 growth within its own longer-run range.

1981-05-18,10,"(10) All of the alternatives contemplate slower growth in M-2
than expected at the time of the Committee's previous meeting, when a
March to June M-2 target of 10 percent was considered acceptable.
We would now expect growth of M-2 at about a 7 to 8 percent annual rate
over the March-June period for alternative C. Somewhat higher growth
rates would be expected under alternatives A and B. The slower
March-June growth projected for M-2 essentially reflects the unexpectedly
sharp deceleration recently in growth of its nontransactions component,
including both small time and savings deposits and money market funds.
Money market fund growth is expected to remain weak over the near-term,
and particularly so if market interest rates rise and thereby temporarily
widen their spread over MMMF yields. As shown in chart 2, the level of M-2
in June would be at the upper bound of its longer-run range for the year
under alternative C, while it would remain somewhat above the range under
the other two alternatives.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1981-08-18,10,"(10) To achieve the alternative A specifications, total reserves
probably would have to expand at about a 13 percent annual rate in August
and September, considerably more than in July. Even such a rapid expansion
in reserves, and the associated faster money growth, would likely be con-
sistent with short-term interest rates holding near current levels.
Nominal GNP is expected by the staff to expand at a 7 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, suggesting strong transactions demands for money over
the balance of the quarter. Even with the alternative A target specifi-
cations, income velocity of M-B would rise at a relatively rapid annual
rate of about 5 percent this quarter. It seems reasonable to expect that
under alternative A the federal funds rate over the next few weeks might
be in the area of 18 percent. With the current level of discount and
surcharge rates, borrowing at the discount window could be in a $1 to $1
billion range.
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1981-10-05,10,"(10) Under the specifications of alternative C we would expect
growth in M1-B at a 6 percent annual rate over the September to December
period to be consistent with maintaining M2 relatively near to the upper
limit of its longer-run target range. The staff does not expect this
alternative to involve further downward pressures on short-term interest
rates, given the 7 percent increase in nominal GNP projected for the
fourth quarter and assuming less rapid downward shift in demand for M1-B
","alternative C"
1982-05-18,10,"(10) The small decline in M1 over May and June called for by
alternative B would appear to be consistent with a 6 percent growth in
total reserves over the two months. With short-term interest rates
expected to decline--indexed by the federal funds rate drifting down to
the 13½ percent area--depository institutions might be expected to
borrow about $800 million at the current 12 percent discount rate. On
that assumption, nonborrowed reserves would expand by 14 percent at an
annual rate over the two months.
","alternative B"
1982-08-24,10,"(10) Alternative A represents the Committee's current third-
quarter M1 target of 5 percent, but with an upward revision of the M2 target
from 9 to 10 percent in reflection of the strength of this aggregate
currently. To attain the 5 percent target, M1 would have to accelerate to
a 7-3/4 percent annual rate of growth on average in August and September.
This is likely to be consistent with short-term rates over the intermeeting
period at around recent levels, or perhaps a little higher--with the funds
rate in the 9 to 9 1/2 percent area. Such growth in M1 would imply a rise
on a quarterly average basis of only about 2 percent at an annual rate,

Reserve would be around $450 million, and nonborrowed reserves would expand
at about a 9 percent annual rate.
","Alternative B"
1982-11-16,10,"(10) Alternative B, which calls for M2 growth this quarter at
the upper end of the 8½ to 9½ percent range adopted by the Committee at its
last meeting, would be associated with an increase in total reserves at
about a 6¾ percent annual rate over the last two months of the year. Given
continued strong liquidity demands, such an M2 target might involve a
federal funds rate over the intermeeting period fluctuating around the
present 9½ percent discount rate and borrowing at the discount window
ranging around $350 million. Nonborrowed reserves would expand in parallel
with total reserves over the last two months of the year.
","Alternative B"
1983-11-14,10,"(10) The specifications of alternative B are expected to be
consistent with little change in bank reserve positions and money market
conditions from those recently prevailing. Borrowing at the discount
window would be anticipated to be around $650 million and the funds rate
between 9-1/4 and 9-1/2 percent, perhaps closer to the latter rate. De-
spite a pickup in growth of transactions deposits, nonborrowed reserves
would probably change little under this alternative over the two-month
November-December period, owing primarily to the impact of lagged reserve
accounting and changes in the deposit mix.
","alternative B"
1984-03-26,10,"(10) The expansion of M2 is expected to accelerate from its
unusually slow pace of recent months under alternative B--and the other
alternatives as well--after the extraordinary 5-1/2 percent rise in
its velocity in the first quarter. Even with the pickup in M2 growth
and slowing in the rate of increase in GNP, V2 would be expected to rise
at around a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, a little
less than its average increase over the past four quarters. There had
been a marked drop in M2 velocity during the recession, and also in early
may reflect some unwinding of balances that had been moved into M2 for
precautionary reasons or because of the initial attractiveness of MMDAs.
M3 under this alternative is not expected to slow much, if at all, from
its recent pace, with this aggregate remaining around the top of its
long-term range. While CD issuance at banks and thrifts may moderate
somewhat as growth of core deposits picks up, the need for the managed
liabilities in M3 should remain sizable given projected strength in
demands on these institutions for credit by households and businesses
(including additional financing that may be associated with merger
","alternative B"
1985-05-21,10,"(10) Growth of M2 and M3 under alternative B would be expected
to pick up in May and June to a 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent annual rate on
average. Much of the pick-up would be expected in RPs and the other
managed liability components of the broader aggregates, partly as Treasury
deposits at banks drop after late May. Core deposits in the nontransactions
M2 are likely to expand more rapidly than the 6 percent pace of April,
and net inflows to MMMFs are likely to pick up, given the usual lagged
adjustments in changes in returns on these instruments relative to declines
in market rates.
","alternative B"
1985-11-04,10,"(10) Growth of the broader aggregates under alternative B
would be at the lower end of, or somewhat below, the 6 to 7 percent annual
rate for September to December adopted at the previous meeting. M2 would
be expected to grow by 5-1/4 percent over the period, with its nontransac-
tions as well as M1 components picking up in November and December from
their relatively sluggish pace in October. Stronger expansion of core
deposits in the nontransactions component than in recent months is
anticipated, partly in association with somewhat greater household saving
in the fourth quarter. M3 would be expected to increase at a 6 percent
annual rate from September to December. Issuance of the managed liabili-
ties in M3 over the balance of the year should decline from the rapid
pace in September and October, as asset expansion at banks remains fairly
moderate and Treasury deposits rebound once the debt ceiling is lifted.
For the year as a whole, M2 growth under this alternative would be around
M3 growth of 7-3/4 percent would be at the midpoint of its long-run range.

1985-12-16,10,"(10) Given the relatively high level of M1 expected for December,
the more moderate growth of this aggregate through the first months of next
year would still leave it in March, under all three alternatives, above the
upper end of its tentative 4 to 7 percent growth range for 1986, as seen on
the M1 chart. Specifically, under alternative B, M1 growth from the fourth-
quarter 1985 base to March would be around 8-1/2 percent at an annual
rate--above the upper end but within the parallel band associated with its
tentative 1986 range. The modest firming of money market conditions
associated with alternative C would be expected to bring M1 closer to the
upper end of the tentative long-run range, while the easier reserve conditions
of alternative A are likely to put M1 near the upper edge of its band. In
the latter case, though, an even more sizable boost to M1 could develop as
the decline in market rates relative to the return on NOW accounts, which
would be expected to continue to react sluggishly to changes in money market
conditions, brought to quite low levels the opportunity costs of holding a
substantial portion of M1 balances.
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1986-04-01,10,"(10) M1 growth in the March to June period under this alternative
is expected to remain at about the same rate on average as over the first
three months of the year. The transactions demand for M1 is projected to
slacken, given the slowing in nominal GNP growth expected by the staff in
the second quarter and probably also a drop-off in the heavy volume of
financial transactions that accompanied the surge in stock and bond
prices of recent months. On the other hand, demands for M1 are likely to
be boosted somewhat over the next few months by the recent declines in
short-term interest rates. The accompanying flattening of the yield
curve, by working to reduce offering rates on small time deposits, would
also seem to add to demands for interest-bearing M1 balances.1 On a
quarterly average basis, M1 would be expected to expand at a 9 percent
annual rate in the second quarter under alternative B, implying a drop in
velocity at around a 4 percent annual rate, given the staff GNP forecast.
","alternative B"
1986-05-20,10,"(10) Under alternative B market interest rates are likely to
fluctuate near recent levels in coming weeks, with the 3-month Treasury
bill rate between 6 and 6-1/4 percent. The dollar could continue to drift
lower in foreign exchange markets. With long-term rates remaining around
current relatively low levels, credit demands are likely to continue to be
focused on long-term markets. Bond issuance by businesses should remain
heavy and mortgage borrowing very strong. However, weakness in investment
spending and some further slowing in equity retirements are projected to
restrain overall business credit needs, and, in the aggregate, growth of
the debt of private nonfinancial borrowers from March to June should be
only a bit above its first-quarter pace. Federal government debt issuance,
on the other hand, is projected to be stronger in the current quarter,
contributing to an appreciable pickup in total debt growth. This growth
would leave the debt aggregate in June well above its long-run range.
","alternative B"
1986-08-19,10,"(10) Growth of M1, while diminishing over August and September
under alternative B, is likely to remain quite strong at around 13 percent.
Both its demand deposit and NOW account components should still grow fairly
rapidly in the near term, given recent declines in open market rates and, in
the case of OCDs, sluggish adjustment of deposit offering rates, which imply
extremely thin opportunity costs at least for a while. The decline in the
velocity of M1 would be at an 11 percent rate in the third quarter, nearly as
large as the 12 percent drop in the second quarter.
","alternative B"
1986-09-23,10,"(10) M2 growth under alternative B is expected to average around
below its average pace in July and August, but still well in excess of in-
come growth. Based on the staff greenbook forecast, M2 velocity would
decline further--at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. With
money market rates staying around current levels under alternative B, in-
flows from market instruments to liquid retail accounts should continue to
be stimulated by their relatively attractive returns, though flows would
tend to be somewhat smaller than in recent months, reflecting the diminishing
impacts of earlier declines in market rates. In addition, opportunity costs
may widen a bit as offering rates adjust down a little more. The expectation
of a moderate slowing of inflows to retail M2 accounts is based on an
assessment that rates on savings and regular NOW accounts will continue to
be reduced very sluggishly over the balance of the year, despite unusually
low spreads to market rates; should depository institutions show more
willingness to cut offering rates, M2 growth could slow somewhat more.
Growth in M2 also may be restrained by further ebbing in the expansion in
overnight RPs as net purchases of Treasury securities by banks continue to
abate as interest rates stabilize.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1986-11-05,10,"(10) M2, under alternative B, is expected to expand at an 8 per-
cent rate over November and December, a little below the average pace of
September and October and appreciably slower than over the summer months.
This growth would leave M2 right at the upper end of its 6 to 9 percent long-
run range. M2 growth over the remainder of the year should be restrained by
diminishing effects of earlier declines in market rates, and perhaps even
some increase in opportunity costs as depository institutions lower offering
rates on liquid retail deposits. The prospects for a substantial slowing
of retail deposit growth, however, are limited by a continued reluctance on
the part of many depositories to breach the former regulatory ceilings of
M2 growth in the fourth quarter would continue to exceed the expansion of
income, although by a little smaller margin than in the third quarter. The
specifications of alternative B imply a 5 percent rate of decrease in M2
velocity in the fourth quarter, given the staff GNP forecast, bringing the
drop in velocity for the year to an historically large 4 percent.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1986-12-15,10,"(10) Under the specifications of alternative B, M3 would expand
at a 6 percent rate from November to March, near the reduced pace of recent
months and in the lower half of its tentative range. Credit growth at
banks is expected to moderate in early 1987 as business and household loan
demands slacken, and stiffer capital requirements for thrifts should further
restrain their asset growth. Under these circumstances depository institu-
tions will be under little pressure to issue CDs and other managed liabili-
ties in M3. The margin of growth of M3 over GNP would narrow and the con-
traction of M3 velocity in the first quarter would be small--about in line
with its long-term trend.
","alternative B"
1987-03-31,10,"(10) Under alternative B, growth in M2 would be expected to
strengthen to a 6 percent annual rate over the March-to-June period, lifting
this aggregate to the lower end of its long-run range. With market interest
rates little changed for some time now, and not anticipated to move far
from current levels under this alternative, M2 might grow about in line
with income over coming months. Shifts into non-M2 savings vehicles may
diminish, especially should stock prices show less strength, and any use of
M2 balances to pay down existing consumer loans in the wake of tax reform
might abate if those with a significant tax incentive have moved relatively
promptly. The deadline for 1986 IRA contributions is in mid-April, but
with the tax law changes it is difficult to predict the effects on M2
growth. On a quarterly average basis, M2 would rise at only a 4-1/2 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, given the pattern of growth over the
first quarter, and the staff's GNP forecast would imply a small rise in M2
velocity, the first increase in more than a year.
","alternative B"
1987-05-19,10,"(10) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to be held down
in May, in part by the unwinding of tax payment effects. Expansion of this
aggregate is projected to rebound in June to a 5-3/4 percent rate--roughly
in line with the pace that might be expected based on interest rate movements
and projected income growth. But this would still mean rather slow growth
over the second quarter and by June this aggregate would have grown
a full percentage point below its lower bound. Balances depleted by April
tax payments are not likely to be replenished quickly. Rates paid on M2
assets should continue to lag behind recent increases in market rates,
although small time deposit rates in some areas of the country are moving
up quickly. The velocity of M2 implied by the staff's GNP forecast would
rise at a 3 percent annual rate this quarter, compared with a gain less
than half that size in the first quarter. While an increase in velocity
would be expected with the further rise in the average opportunity cost on
M2, under alternative B this increase would be somewhat greater than predicted
by most available models of M2 demand. M2 growth in the second quarter
apparently is being depressed by special factors, perhaps related to a draw-
down of balances accumulated late in 1986 when capital gains were realized,
and to shifting preferences for financing consumer purchases out of liquid
assets rather than with credit.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1987-08-18,10,"(10) Under alternative B, and the other alternatives as well, M2
growth is projected to strengthen in August and September relative to the
weak expansion of recent months. This pickup would reflect primarily a
waning of the damping influence of previous increases in market rates and
opportunity costs. Offering rates on very liquid deposits now seem roughly
in line with the current levels of short-term market rates; however, some
additional upward adjustment in rates on longer-term small time deposits
probably can be expected, given recent increases in yields on market instru-
ments of comparable maturity. With opportunity costs unchanged or narrowing
a bit under this alternative, growth in M2 over the balance of the quarter
is expected to average near 6 percent, around the trend of income. This
growth would bring expansion over June to September to the 5 percent short-
run growth path specified by the Committee at its last meeting. Owing to
its recent weakness, largely reflecting the earlier widening of opportunity
costs, M2 would expand this quarter at only a 3-1/4 percent annual rate on
a quarterly average basis. Given the staff's greenbook projection for nominal
GNP, M2 velocity would be expected to increase at a 3 percent rate, around
the pace of the first half of the year.
","alternative B"
1987-09-22,10,"(10) The slight further firming of short-term rates likely under
alternative B would tend to support trading of the dollar on foreign exchange
markets at around current levels for a while. Under these circumstances, the
Treasury bond rate would be expected to continue to fluctuate a little above
gages could drift higher into more normal alignment with Treasuries. Legis-
lative developments could have a significant effect on the dollar and domestic
financial markets over coming weeks, however. Agreement on a mechanism for
substantial and continuing budget deficit reductions would tend to bolster
bond prices and possibly the dollar. However, should little substantive
progress be made on the budget, or should relatively restrictive trade mea-
sures seem to be in train, bond yields could come under upward pressure.
In addition, if incoming information pointed to continued massive current
account deficits, significant downward pressure on the dollar could well
reemerge. In this event, long-term rates would be expected to rise in re-
flection of associated concerns about inflation and demand for dollar assets,
while short-term rates also would tend to move higher in anticipation of
further monetary restraint. Indeed, the staff GNP forecast envisions further
declines in the dollar over coming quarters and upward movements of short-
term interest rates; in that forecast a portion of these movements has been
assumed to occur in the fourth quarter. 1
","alternative B"
1987-12-15,10,"(10) With federal funds continuing to trade around recent levels,
short-term rates might show mixed movements in coming weeks. Private
short-term rates should decline once year-end pressures have passed,
while Treasury bill yields could edge higher, with the 3-month bill rate
rising to above 6 percent under alternative B. However, any narrowing
of spreads could be limited, as economic uncertainties here and abroad,
combined with the overhang of previous financial difficulties, sustain
market concerns about the financial strength of debtors and the institu-
tions that have extended them credit. The dollar would probably continue
under general downward pressure, although a new G-7 accord could lend an
element of stability for a time. Should dollar weakness abate, and eco-
nomic indicators point to a softer economy along the lines of the staff
forecast, bond yields could drop somewhat from the elevated levels of
recent days.
","alternative B"
1988-03-29,10,"(10) With recent conditions in the reserves market maintained
under alternative B, interest rates would tend to remain around current
levels, at least for a time. But given the staff economic forecast, which
implies a flow of data that would not allay market concerns about
potentially inflationary pressures on resources, the market might well
remain edgy. In addition, if signs of further expansion in domestic demand
were combined with trade data suggesting sluggish adjustment of U.S.
external imbalances, the dollar could come under further downward pressure
which, in this context, would be likely to contribute to some increases in
U.S. interest rates.
","alternative B"
1988-05-17,10,"(10) Under alternative B, opportunity costs of holding liquid
retail accounts would remain higher through midyear than in recent months,
given the likely very gradual response of offering rates on such accounts to
the recent rise in market rates. The unwinding of tax-related balances also
will be depressing money growth rates in May. Both of these influences will
have considerably smaller impacts on M2 than on M1. The latter was boosted
more substantially in April by the temporary build-up of transactions depos-
its and will be more affected by the rise in interest rates as depositors
shift funds from OCDs into small time deposits, whose yields adjust more
promptly to market rates. Growth in M1 is projected to drop below 3 percent
on average over May and June from 11-1/4 percent in April. In light of
weakness early in May, probably related to clearing of tax checks, M2 is
projected to increase at only a 4-1/2 percent rate this month. In June, M2
expansion is expected to rebound to around 6-1/2 percent--a little below the
projected growth of nominal income over the current quarter, owing to higher
opportunity costs. Implied M2 growth from March to June would be held to 7
percent, but, with the rapid M2 expansion through April, quarterly average
growth would amount to around 8 percent. Assuming the staff projection of
second-quarter growth in nominal GNP of around 7 percent, M2 velocity would
fall by about 1 percent, approximately half of the decline in the first
","alternative B"
1988-08-16,10,"(10) M2 under alternative B is expected to increase at a 3-3/4
percent pace over the last two months of the quarter, slightly higher than
in July. This speedup is associated with a strengthening in overnight RPs
and Eurodollars, already evident in recent weekly data, in part as banks
rebuild their government security positions. The retail component of M2
should decelerate in response to wider opportunity costs. Within M2,
liquid household deposits, which have begun to soften in early August, are
expected to be relatively weak. Small time deposit growth should quicken
as the public takes advantage of the more attractive returns offered on
fixed-maturity accounts, but not by enough to offset the moderation in
liquid deposits. Slower OCD growth, along with weakness in demand deposits
as compensating balance requirements are scaled back, should damp M1
expansion over the next two months to an average of just under 4 percent.
","alternative B"
1988-09-20,10,"(10) M2 is expected to continue to grow at a 3 percent annual rate
from August to December under alternative B, with particular weakness in
liquid deposits; M1 is projected to increase at only a 1/2 percent annual
rate over this period. Although offering rates should move closer to cur-
rent levels of market interest rates, growth of M1 and M2 relative to
income will be restrained by the earlier widening of opportunity costs and
the other factors discussed above. M2 velocity would rise at a 3 percent
rate in the fourth quarter, somewhat faster than in the current quarter,
and M1 velocity at a 5-1/2 percent rate.
","alternative B"
1988-12-13,10,"(10) Short-term market interest rates are likely to retreat some-
what under alternative B. These rates now embody some near-term firming of
policy, and as funds ease back a bit from their recent trading range and as
no subsequent tightening move materializes, short-term rates are likely to
drop. The 3-month Treasury bill rate should fall from around the recent
could be damped for a time, however, reflecting the effects of normal year-
end activity and a potential surge in credit demands associated with
corporate restructuring over coming months. These developments will have
their greatest impact on short-term rates, especially in light of the large
volume of bank financing of equity retirements. Any declines in long-term

rates might be quite limited, given the recent rally in bond markets. These
markets already seem to be building in some prospective budget deficit
reduction, and would be sensitive to any indication of disappointing
progress. Moreover, the dollar likely would come under downward pressure
under this alternative, raising concern about future inflation trends,
especially if the decline occurred in the context of continued strength in
the economy as envisioned in the staff forecast.
","alternative B"
1989-03-28,10,"(10) The existing structure of interest rates appears to incor-
porate some expectation that monetary policy may be a little firmer in the
near term than is assumed under alternative B. As a consequence, with
federal funds continuing around 9-3/4 percent or even a little above under
alternative B, money market rates might tend to decline a bit. Three-
month Treasury bills at the current level of 9 percent would seem appro-
priately priced in relation to the prevailing federal funds rate under
usual supply and demand conditions; but if strong retail demands continue,
these rates also might edge lower, especially once the early-April cash
management bill is absorbed. The dollar might come under some downward
pressure as short-term rates softened and the prospects for further near-
term monetary tightening in the United States were reassessed. Given
recent mixed signals about the strength of the expansion, bond markets are

likely to be especially sensitive to incoming information about devel-
opments in the economy. Should the incoming data point more clearly to
continued strength in the economy and prices, consistent with the
greenbook forecast, bond yields would be unlikely to fall with an
unchanged System policy stance and could even move higher.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1989-08-22,10,"(10) Alternative A's policy easing likely would engender general
declines in market yields. A 50 basis point reduction in the trading
range for federal funds would come more promptly, and be larger, than the
easing currently built into the structure of interest rates. Money market
interest rates could drop 1/4 percentage point or so--and somewhat more if
the action itself fostered the notion that the Federal Reserve would be
inclined to undertake additional steps to loosen reserve pressure in the
months ahead. A rally in bond markets also would seem probable, espe-
cially because inflation concerns do not now seem to be weighing on market
psychology; however, should spending prove reasonably strong, there is
some risk that such concerns would be reignited against the background of
the further easing of policy in alternative A. Some downward adjustment
to the exchange value of the dollar also could occur since foreign author-
ities would be unlikely to follow up with comparable easing actions in
light of inflationary pressures abroad.
","Alternative A, alternative A"
1989-10-03,10,"(10) Interest rates would be expected to remain near current
levels under alternative B. Markets do not now appear to be anticipating
any near-term change in policy, and incoming economic data consistent
with the staff greenbook forecast are not likely to provoke significant
change in market sentiment. In the weeks ahead, Treasury markets may be
buffeted by the possible sale of sizable volumes of REFCORP bonds and by
shifting odds on triggering a debt ceiling decline on November 1, which
could affect the mid-quarter refunding. The dollar would be expected to
fluctuate around current lower levels, or weaken a little further should
some key foreign central banks tighten policy--as to a degree now seems to
be expected by markets. Should the dollar rebound strongly, however,
domestic interest rates might edge off if market participants saw this as
implying reduced inflation pressures and greater prospects for policy
easing in the United States.
","alternative B"
1989-11-14,10,"(10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate
under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than market partici-
pants are now expecting. Rates on other short-term instruments would
decline by nearly the same amount, with the 3-month bill rate dropping
ultimately toward the 7 percent area. In response to the further narrow-
ing of differentials between U.S. and foreign interest rates, the exchange
value of the dollar could be expected to adjust downward. Bond yields
probably would decline noticeably under alternative A; market participants
may interpret an immediate further easing as suggesting a more aggressive
policy posture by the Federal Reserve, and perhaps an assessment of sub-
stantial underlying weakening in the economy. However, should incoming
data show the economy continuing to advance at its recent pace over coming
months, in the context of a weaker dollar, the cumulative effect of past
easing measures and alternative A over a short time might be viewed as
setting the stage for a subsequent strengthening of the economy, raising
questions about prospects for prices.
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1989-12-18,10,"(10) Money growth paths from November to March associated with
each alternative are shown in the table below. (More detailed data appear
in the table and charts on the following pages.) Boosted by earlier
declines in interest rates, M2 growth under all the alternatives would
continue fairly strong, running through the first quarter at or above the
upper end of its tentative 3 to 7 percent target cone for 1990, though
within the associated parallel band. The outlook for M3 continues to be
clouded by considerable uncertainties about thrifts. One source of uncer-
tainty pertains to the rate at which solvent but capital-deficient in-
stitutions pare assets in order to meet new FIRREA capital requirements.
Another is the near-term activity of the RTC; absent provision for working
capital early next year, RTC's scope for completing deals and replacing
high-cost funds in the first quarter may be limited. As noted above, both
RTC activity and S&L asset runoffs appear to have diminished substan-
tially, but we expect these factors to become more important in the months
ahead, retarding M3, though not to the degree of late summer and early
fall.6 As a consequence, M3 growth is projected to continue below that
of M2, leaving this aggregate in March in the middle portion of its
tentative range.

","alternative a"
1990-03-27,10,"(10) An immediate policy easing under alternative A that brought
the federal funds rate down to 7-3/4 percent would run counter to market
sentiment and ripple through the money market, with other short-term rates
likely declining a similar amount. Lower short-term funding costs also
should engender reductions in lending rates on business and consumer
credit. The exchange value of the dollar would tend to adjust downward.
A dollar depreciation might combine with prospects for somewhat stronger
U.S. economic activity to heighten domestic inflationary expectations,
limiting the declines in longer-term yields.
","alternative A"
1990-11-13,10,"(10) In view of the expectations of some easing already built
into rates, short-term interest rates would decrease somewhat less than
the 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate, under alternative A.
Banks may be encouraged to advance credit less reluctantly by the wider
margins they would enjoy, and by greater confidence of repayment as lower
interest rates countered weakness in the economy and bolstered asset
prices. Banks eventually would pass the drop in funding costs on to their
customers through a lower prime rate, though the adjustment could be slug-
gish, especially given the desire to limit footings at year-end, and mar-
gins will remain unusually high. In the context of the softer economy and
lessened pressures on resources, long-term rates, too, should decline,
with fixed-rate mortgages dropping below 10 percent. The extent of the
decline in long-term rates might be limited should the likely drop in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar be especially steep, which would be
seen as accentuating price pressures, possibly limiting the scope for
further policy easing. The odds on a sharper drop in the dollar would be
greater if the easing seemed to reflect especially heightened Federal
Reserve concern about the strength of the financial system and the real
economy, with reduced priority given to restraining price pressures. From
this perspective, the risk that market participants would interpret a
signals might be increased if the cut were accomplished by a reduction in
the discount rate.
","alternative A"
1990-12-18,10,"(10) Two near-term policy alternatives are presented below for
Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would con-
tinue to trade in the 7-1/4 percent area and adjustment plus seasonal bor-
rowing would initially be specified at $100 million.3 Under alternative
A, the funds rate would decline to the vicinity of 6-3/4 percent. Alter-
native A could be implemented through a reduction in the borrowing assump-
tion of only $25 million to $75 million or through a half-point cut in the
discount rate combined with the same borrowing assumption as specified for
alternative B.4
","alternative B, alternative
A, alternative B"
1991-03-26,10,"(10) Under alternative A, money market rates would likely
decrease by close to the full amount of the reduction in the federal funds
rate, and the prime rate would be lowered 1/2 percentage point, given its
already wide margin over funding costs. The dollar would decline promptly
and substantially. The drop in interest rates and the dollar could be
seen by market participants as adding further stimulus at a time when a
rebound in the economy already is expected. In such circumstances, bond
rates might not decline by much, and could even back up. A reversal of
any adverse reaction would occur, however, if incoming data began to con-
firm that the easing had correctly anticipated weaker money growth, more
favorable trends in prices, or a substantial further shortfall in
economic activity.
","alternative A"
1991-05-14,10,"(10) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to strengthen to a
likely to be concentrated in its transaction component. M1 should resume
growing at nearly a 5 percent pace over the two months, as demand deposits
and OCDs recover from their tax-related weakness and are buttressed later
in the quarter by the expected strengthening in nominal income. Moreover,
currency expansion is expected to reemerge with the waning of reflows from
the Persian Gulf region. The nontransaction component of M2 also is
likely to accelerate; money funds should rebound a bit, and, with a
smaller amount thought to be maturing, the runoff of retail time deposits
probably will abate from the unusually rapid pace of April. The 4 percent
growth of M2 from March to June under alternative B implies a quarterly
average growth rate of 5 percent; this exceeds the staff's projected
growth of nominal GNP by 2 percentage points, producing a third straight
quarter of M2 velocity decline. Still, the projected M2 growth remains
below that forecast by the staff's econometric model, but, at less than a
percentage point, the model overprediction would be considerably smaller
than in the last three quarters. Some lessening of concerns about the
soundness of depositories and the virtual cessation of RTC activity and
associated disruptions to deposit flows may be the main factors behind the
closer alignment of second-quarter M2 growth with historical patterns.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1991-08-20,10,"(10) The 1/2 percentage point drop in the funds rate con-
templated under alternative A is larger than the easing of policy
currently anticipated in the markets; thus, short-term rates are
likely to move down under this alternative--but not by as much as the
cut in the funds rate--with the three-month bill rate drifting to near
operations alone, bringing the funds rate well below the discount
rate, market participants might speculate about the need for a dis-
count rate cut, and whether such a cut would be accompanied by an
additional easing. The prime rate likely would decline by the 50
basis point drop in the funds rate, leaving the spread over funding
costs at a historically high level. Bond rates initially would de-
crease a bit, but such declines might erode should incoming informa-
tion suggest that the economic recovery is more solidly under way,
along the lines of the staff forecast. The dollar would decline on
foreign exchange markets.
","alternative A"
1991-11-05,10,"(11) M3 under alternative B is seen as continuing to grow at
a 1 percent annual rate over November and December, which would mean
this aggregate would be entering next year around the bottom of its
tentative 1992 range of 1 to 5 percent. Despite the reduced
projection for RTC activity, growth of M3 over the rest of the year is
likely to be a little slower than expected at the last FOMC meeting.
The weaker outlook for M3 stems from our anticipation that the
substitution of non-M3 liabilities for Yankee CDs at branches and
agencies of foreign banks surfacing in October probably will persist
to some degree. Projected weakness in bank credit continues to damp
the outlook for M3. Growth of C&I loans will be anemic owing to
continued restraint by banks and, more important, to weak demand.
Business outlays for fixed capital and inventories are likely to be
soft, and offerings in bond and equity markets should remain robust,
as those firms that can access these markets seek to strengthen
balance sheets. Lending for commercial properties will remain
depressed by sustained difficulties in this sector. Household mort-
gage growth will be restrained by the modest recovery in housing
activity envisioned in the staff forecast. Consumer credit should
contract further over the remainder of the year, largely reflecting
subdued spending on durables. In the aggregate, borrowing of domestic
nonfederal sectors is expected to remain sluggish through year-end.
In contrast, federal borrowing will stay brisk to finance a burgeoning
deficit. Overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
register a 5 percent rate of expansion over the September-to-December
period, placing growth for the year about 1/2 percentage point above
the bottom of the FOMC's 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range for
this aggregate.
","alternative B"
1991-12-17,10,"(10) Two alternatives are given below for Committee considera-
tion. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would continue to
center around 4-1/2 percent, in association with the allowance for ad-
justment plus seasonal borrowing staying at $75 million.3 Alterna-
tive A incorporates a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the funds rate
to 4 percent, which could be implemented in either of two ways--by
reducing the borrowing allowance to $25 million while keeping the dis-
count rate unchanged at 4-1/2 percent, or by cutting the discount rate
to 4 percent while keeping the borrowing allowance unchanged at its
current level. Although the former variant of alternative A, which
involves funds trading 1/2 percentage point below the discount rate,
would be technically possible, it likely would be associated with
somewhat greater day-to-day volatility in the funds rate. In addition,
the unusual negative spread could engender confusion among market par-
ticipants, with some speculating that a discount rate cut was imminent
and others perceiving a signal that monetary easing in this economic
cycle was over.

1992-03-31,10,"(10) The steepening yield curve for maturities out to two
years and the pattern of futures market quotations suggest some firming
of expectations that policy will tighten beginning later in the year.
In this context, the unexpected easing of money market conditions of
alternative A might cause a market reassessment of the intentions of the
Federal Reserve, leading to a significant downward revision in the
expected course of short-term interest rates for the next year or so.
Short-term rates would fall by about the 1/2 percentage point drop in
the funds rate, and some intermediate-term rates might drop quite sub-
stantially as well. Effects on expected rates at longer horizons are
more difficult to judge. In the absence of a worsening in the economic
outlook, the easing might be interpreted as expansionary--and poten-
tially inflationary--and short-term rates would be expected to rebound
ultimately to even higher levels than market participants now antici-
pate; in this event, bond yields might drop relatively little, if at
all. If the policy ease came to be seen as needed to counter threats to
the expansion, however, arising perhaps from recent upward movements in
long-term interest rates and exchange rates, the action could be viewed
as promising lower short-term rates for a considerable period, and bond
rates would move down appreciably. In either case, the dollar would

1992-05-19,10,"(10) The extent of the easing of reserve market conditions
under alternative A would catch market participants unawares, and the
able decline in other money market interest rates. Commercial banks
are likely to pass through the funds-rate reduction fully to the prime
rate, while retaining a relatively wide spread over costs of funds.
Recent declines in long-term rates, occurring as markets were beginning
to build in a possible easing, suggest that a decrease in bond yields
might accompany such an action. However, following an easing move,
especially of the dimensions of alternative A, investors would become
more assured of sustained economic expansion, but also less confident of
any longer-term decrease in inflation, which together would limit any
reductions in long-term rates. With interest rates on dollar-denomi-
nated securities becoming less attractive relative to returns abroad,
the exchange value of the dollar would adjust downward.

likely to fall well short of the rates envisioned at the time of the

leaving these aggregates below their annual target ranges under all

easing of reserve conditions may well be imminent, involving an an-

conditions of alternative B would initially induce some backup in
interest rates across the maturity spectrum and some rise in the ex-

the extent that market participants viewed any policy action as merely

postponed. The market's expectations of an eventual ease would be
strengthened should incoming data confirm the tepid expansion and
disinflationary trends in the Greenbook forecast. That forecast en-
compasses the possibility of some decline in short-term rates over
coming months, but keeping the funds rate at 3 percent over the six
weeks of the intermeeting period would not necessarily be inconsistent
with that possibility. In any event, a decline in long-term rates
could eventually develop even at an unchanged funds rate as evidence
of disinflation takes firm enough hold to offset skittishness about
fiscal policy; indeed, failing to meet market expectations about
policy easing could well strengthen perceptions that the disinflation
trend will be sustained.
","alternative B"
1993-05-18,10,"(10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds
rate under alternative A would surprise market participants and should
show through almost completely to other short-term interest rates. The
three-month bill rate would fall to around 2-1/2 percent, and the prime
rate probably would be reduced to 5-1/2 percent. With the economy
likely to exhibit a bit more strength than otherwise over the inter-
mediate run as a result of the easing, banks may feel a little more
confident about the ability of borrowers to repay loans. As a result,
banks might further ease other terms and standards on lending. Risk
premiums in short- and long-term market interest rates, already histori-
cally narrow, would probably remain around their current levels. Any
initial decline in longer-term yields could be limited by concerns that
the easier monetary policy stance indicated more emphasis on supporting
the economic expansion and less emphasis on containing inflation, par-
ticularly against the backdrop of the recent disappointing wage and
price behavior and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal
policy debate. Absent corresponding actions abroad to ease monetary
policy, downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar
would resume.
","alternative A"
1993-09-21,10,"(10) Under alternative A, money market interest rates would
drop by the full 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate.
The prime rate would also decrease by this amount. Intermediate-term
rates would fall appreciably, as expectations of the path of short-
term rates in the months ahead were revised down, and the dollar would
weaken on foreign exchange markets. Real long-term rates would move
lower as well, and the drop in interest and exchange rates would
provide additional stimulus to spending over time. The extent of the
decline in nominal bond rates, however, would depend importantly on
how the market interpreted the Committee's rationale for this action.
","alternative A"
1993-11-16,10,"(10) Under Alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise
reserve market conditions is not embedded in market interest rates, and
consequently, short-term interest rates are likely to rise by nearly the
full 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds. Long-term
rates probably would rise appreciably at first, but some of those in-
creases could be reversed over time as market participants interpreted
that action as trimming the trajectory of economic activity and prices
and reducing the need for more aggressive tightening in the future.
With dollar-denominated returns rising significantly, the dollar likely
would appreciate considerably on foreign exchange markets.
","Alternative C"
1993-12-21,10,"(10) Under alternative B, M3 would advance at a 1 percent
annual rate over the November-to-March period; by March this aggregate
would be 1-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter 1993 base, well within
its 0 to 4 percent provisional range for 1994. Bank credit should
continue to expand around the 5 percent pace of 1993, and banks are
expected to persist in funding much of the growth with lower cost,
non-M3 sources, in part to avoid deposit insurance premiums. The debt
of the nonfederal sectors will grow at a 4-3/4 percent rate through
March, in line with the stepped-up pace of the second half of 1993.
Household borrowing is expected to continue to be strong, reflecting
more comfortable financial positions and the high level of spending on
housing and durable goods. Overall financing needs of businesses are
expected to grow as advances in capital spending outstrip growth in
internal funds, and as net equity issuance is held down by a major
merger. Total debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to increase
at a 5-3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter of 1993 to March, well
above the lower end of its provisional 4 to 8 percent range for next
","alternative B"
1994-03-22,10,"(10) Alternative B might be favored if most of the increase
in intermediate- and long-term real rates over recent months were
thought likely to persist and be sufficient to restrain demand and
head off additional inflationary pressures. The staff economic fore-
cast assumes that policy needs to tighten eventually to maintain high
enough real rates to avoid an overheating of the economy. However,
that forecast does not necessarily assume a move as soon as the March
meeting. Even if long-term rates were expected to decline appreci-
ably, alternative B might be selected were the economy nevertheless
seen as remaining below its long-term potential and inflation pres-
sures contained. Such an assessment could be based on a sense that
recent data suggested less momentum in the economy or on a judgment
that the behavior of costs and broad price indexes has been indicating
a greater degree of slack in the economy than embodied in the staff

1994-05-17,10,"(10) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented below
for Committee consideration. Under alternative B. federal funds would
continue to trade around 3-3/4 percent, in association with the al-
lowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing remaining initially at
$175 million.5  Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would
move up 1/4 percentage point (one-half the usual adjustment shown in
previous bluebooks for ""alternative C"") to 4 percent, effectuated by
increasing the initial borrowing allowance to $200 million. Under
alternative D, the federal funds rate would be raised to 4-1/4 per-
cent, either by increasing the initial borrowing allowance to $225
million or by raising the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent, while keep-
ing the initial allowance for discount window borrowing at $175 mil-
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative C"
1994-09-27,10,"(10) A tightening in reserve conditions at this meeting
might be favored if the Committee saw a significant risk that output
is in the process of surpassing its long-run potential. Waiting in
these circumstances might risk the development of a degree of infla-
tion momentum--partly through expectations channels--that could make
it more difficult to contain inflation at recent rates, much less
achieve the long-run goal of price stability. The 50 basis point
firming of alternative D is the most likely of the three policy
options to keep the Federal Reserve ""ahead of the curve"" of inflation
pressures and consequently to limit the extent to which policy might
later need to tighten. If the Committee were uncertain about how much
tightening would be required but wanted to respond to recent data, the
more modest 25 basis point move of alternative C might be considered
","alternative C"
1994-12-20,10,"(10) As noted above, market participants now assess the
probability of a near-term tightening as fairly low, but they see an
intermeeting move before the next scheduled FOMC meeting on January 31
and February 1 as more likely. In these circumstances, and given the
seemingly greater confidence of late in financial markets that the
System will act as appropriate to counter a buildup in inflationary
pressures, interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar
are unlikely to change very much in the immediate aftermath of a deci-
sion to leave policy unchanged, as under Alternative B. Movements in
financial markets subsequently will depend, of course, on the nature
of incoming data. Continued strength in employment or final demand,
especially if accompanied by adverse wage and price developments,
would firm market expectations of System action early next year.
Inaction in the face of such data could risk the re-emergence of con-
cerns that the Federal Reserve was falling behind in its efforts to
contain inflation, raising long-term interest rates and weakening the
foreign exchange value of the dollar.
","Alternative B"
1995-03-28,10,"(10) A case for the 1/2 percentage point increase in the
federal funds rate of alternative C could be made on the grounds that,
with economic activity having already overshot its potential and the
persistence of the slowdown in economic growth not yet firmly estab-
lished, more insurance should be taken out against a serious deterior-
ation in inflation trends. The risk of such an outcome would seem
even greater if it were judged that markets have overreacted, implying
undesirable additional stimulus from the declines in interest and
exchange rates and the rise in stock prices. The need for prompt
further policy firming would be especially pressing to the extent that
the Committee were dissatisfied with the prospects in the staff fore-
cast for a sustained higher level of core inflation. Judging from the
alternative simulations in the Greenbook, even a 50 basis point in-
crease in the federal funds rate would leave the core CPI inflation
rate in 1996 above that in 1994 and might not be sufficient to restore
a downward tilt in subsequent years.
","alternative C"
1995-05-23,10,"(10) The fifty-basis-point firming of alternative C might be
favored by the Committee if it wished to provide more assurance that
pressures on resources would soon diminish, so as not to perpetuate
the recently elevated rate of inflation and, over time, to return the
economy toward a disinflationary path. The depreciation of the dol-
lar, the rise in bond and equity prices, and the continued relaxation
of terms and conditions on bank loans this year have in effect eased
financial conditions substantially. Markets seem to have reacted
strongly to what could prove to be only a moderate downshift in
underlying demand conditions, and current financial conditions may
therefore provide excessive stimulus to an economy already operating
around its potential.
","alternative C"
1995-08-22,10,"(10) A further easing of policy, as under alternative A,
could be supported if recent price and wage news were read as suggest-
ing that the underlying determinants of inflation were more favorable
than in the staff forecast. With inflation and inflation expectations
decreasing in these circumstances, nominal rates would have to be
reduced to keep real rates from rising. Indeed, the Committee might
want to lower real rates as well if it wished to realize a little
higher output as well as lower inflation. In addition, the Committee
might want to consider lowering the federal funds rate if it were
concerned that risks to the economic outlook were still seen to be
concentrated on the down side. Such risks might be viewed as height-
ened by the recent increases in longer-term interest rates and in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar, if the Committee thought that
markets had overreacted to stronger data, especially in light of on-
coming fiscal restraint.
","alternative A"
1995-09-26,10,"(10) The case for keeping the funds rate at 5-3/4 percent as
under alternative B could rest on an assessment that the current funds
rate may well provide the appropriate monetary impulse, at least for
the time being. The staff forecast could be viewed as representing
both a likely occurrence under a stable funds rate, even with the
substantial fiscal restraint assumed, and a satisfactory balance be-
tween the Committee's inflation and employment objectives. Moreover,
with the dollar recently under downward pressures, and financial mar-
kets looking for clues as to how the Federal Reserve evaluates and
will respond to the evolving fiscal situation, any change in the
stance of policy could risk market overreaction and misinterpretation.
Under these conditions, even if the Committee saw some odds that the
economy or inflation would come in below the staff forecast, it might
choose to stand pat until easing was more clearly called for by incom-
ing economic data.
","alternative B"
1995-11-15,10,"(10) Earlier expectations of the possibility of easing at the
November FOMC meeting have largely been erased and, thus, the choice
of alternative B should have little impact on market interest rates.
The dollar would trade on foreign exchange markets around its current
level. Although market attention over the intermeeting period is
likely to remain focused on the budget deliberations, evidence of
persistent strength in private final demands along the lines of the
staff forecast might cause markets to begin to question their expecta-
tions about the path of interest rates going forward, and intermedi-
ate- and long-term rates could edge higher.
","alternative B"
1995-12-19,10,"(10) The Greenbook forecast embodies a backup of longer-term
yields of this magnitude with a flat federal funds rate through most
of the forecast period. Nonetheless, because the staff assessment is
that aggregate demand will be slightly stronger than implicit in
financial markets or the Blue Chip survey, the higher trajectory of
interest rates is seen as consistent with output remaining close to
potential and inflation running around 3 percent over the next two
years. Accordingly, in the staff forecast, alternative B keeps policy
on a path that produces results for economic growth and inflation over
that were reported in July.
","alternative B"
1996-03-26,10,"(10) Given the staff's assessment of the economy, the 1/2
percentage point easing in reserve market conditions offered under
alternative A would boost the economy marginally further beyond its
potential and tilt the inflation rate up a bit more noticeably. With
the latter outcome apparently inconsistent with the Committee's
strategy for achieving its long-run goals, adopting alternative A
would seem to require that, relative to the staff, Committee members
expect somewhat weaker spending or better inflation. For example,
policy relaxation might be seen as buying further insurance against
the risk that the recent rise in bond yields would truncate the ap-
parent strengthening in activity this year or as attaching weight to
the possibility that the NAIRU is lower.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1996-05-21,10,"(10) Despite these potential problems on the inflation front,
the minimum wage has not yet been raised, measures of industrial
prices and of strains on production capacity remain quiescent, and
recent information on core PPI/CPI inflation provides little evidence
of an incipient acceleration. Moreover, the rise in intermediate- and
long-term rates this year may have left these measures not far from
levels consistent with the economy producing at its potential. In
these circumstances, the Committee may prefer to adopt alternative B,
awaiting more concrete evidence that inflationary pressures are emerg-
ing before adopting a tightening action. Financial market partici-
pants are anticipating that the FOMC will leave its policy stance
unchanged at this meeting, implying that selection of alternative B
would have little market impact. Although the Greenbook is forecast-
ing a strong second quarter, many market economists have a similar
view, and hence release of economic data in conformity with the Green-
book forecast should not elicit much response in security prices or
dollar exchange rates.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1996-09-24,10,"(10) A tightening of policy at this Committee meeting,
whether by 50 basis points, as assumed in alternative C, or by only 25
basis points, would improve the chances that price pressures would be
contained and inflation outcomes would be consistent with the Commit-
tee members' expectations in July. In the alternative scenarios in
the Greenbook, an increase of one percentage point in the federal
funds rate over the next year is sufficient to tilt core inflation
down. A 25 or 50 basis point tightening at this meeting could be seen
either as a first installment in moving more deliberately toward lower
inflation, or as a more limited action aimed at holding the line.
With labor markets tight and wage gains already strengthening, the
Committee may see it as only a matter of time before total compensa-
tion puts sufficient pressure on profit margins to prompt businesses
to raise their prices faster. Especially if aggregate demand has more
momentum than in the staff forecast, waiting for very long to tighten,
given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, risks embedding some
rise in inflation and inflation expectations into the economy and
financial markets. That result would necessitate more aggressive and
potentially disruptive policy action at a later date to return infla-
tion to recent levels.
","alternative C"
1996-11-13,10,"(10) A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, as
under alternative A, might be favored if the Committee viewed the
recent softness of final sales as likely to persist. Under those
circumstances, inventories may turn out higher than firms desire,
imparting an additional drag on production over the next couple of
quarters. But even if the staff forecast of spending is accepted, the
Committee may view the recent favorable performance of wages and
prices as suggesting that the natural rate of unemployment is still
lower than that implicit in the staff's inflation forecast. If so,
the economy may not have overshot its potential, and price pressures
may be weaker than in the staff forecast.
","alternative A"
1996-12-17,10,"(10) A 50 basis point firming of the funds rate (alternative C) might be
favored if the Committee wished to move promptly to stem the rise in underlying
inflation in the staff forecast and increase the odds on making some headway on its
longer-run objective of price stability. With persistent indications of tightness in labor
markets, some firming in wages, and disappointing news on reported productivity, the
Committee may see significant risks of a resurgence of inflation that could elevate
inflation expectations and ultimately prove costly to wring out of the economy. Such
concerns might be accentuated if the Committee saw the run-up in share prices as
likely to persist, boosting spending above that in the staff forecast, and as indicative
of an accommodative monetary policy that would eventually show through to the
prices of other assets and goods and services.
","alternative C"
1997-08-19,10,"(10) With no near-term tightening expected, the market response to implementation
of alternative C could be sharp. Short-term market rates would jump by the full 25 basis
point increase in the funds rate; the prime rate likely would be lifted by an equivalent
amount. Bond markets would sell off as well. Investors would have difficulty interpreting
such an action in light of developments over the intermeeting period, and their response might
be shaped in part by the Federal Reserve's announcement. Participants might well think that
the action represented a one-time adjustment to rebalance risks, in which case the response
would tend to be muted. But more pronounced decreases in bond prices can not be ruled out
because investors might interpret the action as signifying that the Federal Reserve had
reassessed its fundamental outlook and now saw a more serious and sustained inflation threat
that would call for further tightening actions. If so, the value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets probably would strengthen considerably. In either case, equity prices
almost certainly would fall, as real interest rates rose, and the decline could be considerable if
capital losses spurred investors to reexamine their assumptions regarding the risks of equity
","alternative C"
1997-09-30,10,"(10) Under the unchanged policy stance of alternative B, the growth of the
monetary aggregates should slow significantly. The expansion of money market fund shares,
an important contributor to M2 growth in recent months, has already begun to settle down as
the response to last month's equity price decline has abated. Still, the rapid growth of M2 in
August and September implies that this aggregate will begin the fourth quarter at a high level,
so even substantial slowing thereafter leaves quarterly average growth at an elevated rate--
indeed, again a shade above that projected for nominal GDP. M3 growth will slow as well,
but will remain above the rate of expansion of M2 owing to continued rapid expansion of
institution-only mutual funds, which are gaining market share in the cash management
business, and further substantial growth in large time deposits. All told, M2 and M3 growth
for 1997 should be about 1/2 and 2-1/4 percentage points, respectively, above their annual
ranges. Under alternative C, even though opportunity costs would likely rise with the
imposition of monetary restraint, M2 might be bolstered to some extent in the near term
should a correction in the stock and bond markets induce investors to favor money market
over bond and stock mutual funds.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1997-11-12,10,"(10) Alternative B, which would leave the intended federal funds rate at 5-1/2
percent, could be chosen at this meeting either merely as a deferral of a tighter stance until
financial markets have become more resilient, or, more positively, as a justifiable policy
posture, absent some change in the tenor of incoming information about inflation prospects.
The continuing string of data suggesting stronger real activity and softer inflation than
expected has provided evidence that, at least in some respects, economic behavior is deviating
from historical patterns. In those circumstances, knowing at what point resource pressures
will induce cost and price acceleration--and hence when preemptive policy actions would
become warranted--is difficult, making a ""wait-and-see"" posture more attractive. Despite the
recent strength in aggregate demand, the current policy stance still could turn out to be
consistent with sustainable economic expansion and subdued inflation. Indeed, inflation
expectations probably have receded even further of late; certainly that would be consistent
with the narrowing spread between yields on the Treasury's nominal and inflation-protected
securities. By itself, this development should restrain the wage- and price-setting process.
Moreover, the fall in inflation expectations has further raised real short-term interest rates,
which should work to restrain spending over time, other things equal.
","Alternative B"
1997-12-16,10,"(10) The markets expect no policy action over the next few months and would react
little, if at all, to the choice of alternative B. Apart from year-end effects, interest rates--
especially Treasury yields--should fluctuate close to recent lows over the intermeeting period.
Any tendency for rates to edge higher if foreign markets settle down should be offset by the
effects of more moderate economic growth, as in the staff forecast. Stock prices, however,
could drift down as economic reports begin to undermine the prospects for profits. In these
circumstances, investors might reevaluate credit risk more generally, and spreads on bonds
could widen a touch further. The market for Treasury securities might, from time to time, be
buffeted by the fallout from developments in Asia. On occasion in recent weeks, the
Treasury market has weakened temporarily on the expectation of official and private sales of
Treasuries for purposes of addressing financial difficulties in Asia, and such events could well
recur over the weeks and months ahead. However, by themselves, such sales are unlikely to
have much lasting effect on dollar yields because they do not change the fundamental outlook
for prices and spending in the United States. Moreover, they should be easily absorbed into
markets benefiting from demands for safer assets and from reduced borrowing by Asian
financial institutions to the extent they repay dollar liabilities with the proceeds of their asset
","alternative B"
1998-03-31,10,"(10) If the Committee saw substantial risks of a significantly weaker economy than
in the staff forecast, it might want to move promptly to ease policy, perhaps by lowering the
federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, as in alternative A. Such a risk to aggregate demand
might arise not only from greater Asian effects than currently anticipated, but also from
weaker domestic demand. Some of the recent robust expansion in the latter may be
temporary, owing importantly to the net decline in oil prices since last fall and to the drop in
intermediate- and long-term interest rates prompted by expectations of impending weakness
from Asia. The rate declines and robust economy, in turn, have bolstered business and
consumer confidence and the stock market. As restraint from the external sector is felt more
fully, especially if it appears to be more severe or prolonged than the public now expects, the
unwinding of buoyant psychology and the drop in equity prices could cause a more
pronounced damping of domestic demand than the staff anticipates. The Committee may see
the current relatively low inflation rate as justifying a more forceful and prompter reaction to
this possibility than might have been appropriate at higher inflation rates, especially in light
of the tendency to overpredict inflation over the past few years. Inflation has declined by
more than the Committee or the staff had expected, raising the prospect that, should those
disinflationary forces persist and be overlaid by an unexpected shortfall in aggregate demand,
inflation could fall farther than the Committee would find desirable.
","alternative A"
1998-08-18,10,"(10) In view of recent developments in global financial markets, the Committee might
be inclined to consider a 25 basis point easing of monetary policy, as in alternative A.
Aggregate demand in the United States apparently has already decelerated appreciably, and
Committee members may believe that the staff forecast does not give enough weight to ongoing
deflationary forces coming from developments abroad. Moreover, the staff forecast may be
viewed as underplaying the restrictive effects of recent changes in U.S. financial markets, despite
declines in some nominal yields: The dollar has strengthened on net against a broad basket of
currencies; U.S. equity prices have fallen significantly; and declines in inflation expectations may
have largely accounted for the decline in nominal interest rates, leaving real rates little changed.
Even in the context of the staff view of the economic outlook, with domestic inflation currently
at low levels, the Committee may be willing to risk a slightly less satisfactory outcome in terms
of U.S. inflation performance to help foster a recovery in foreign economies, which would be in
the long-run interest of the United States. Lower interest rates would help ensure that domestic
demand in the United States remains reasonably vigorous. And lower rates, along with
somewhat less strength in the dollar, would benefit a number of foreign economies, even those
with currencies not tied to the dollar; for those in the latter group, credit-risk spreads would tend
to decline as concerns about foreign debt repayment abated a bit, and the tendency for their
currencies to appreciate would give them room to adopt a somewhat less restrictive monetary
","alternative A"
1998-09-29,10,"(10) Although the staff projection embodies a substantial weakening in aggregate
demand, data to date suggest that the economy is growing near its potential rate. With labor
markets still quite tight and forecasts in recent years often underpredicting economic activity, the
Committee may wish to have more evidence in hand that growth of aggregate demand is slowing
considerably before easing policy. If so, the Committee would find the unchanged stance of
policy under alternative B appropriate. The recent tightening of credit supply conditions and
drop in equity prices toward a more realistic alignment with earnings prospects may be viewed as
necessary and overdue corrections that will help to prevent speculative and inflationary
imbalances from developing. An easing at this time might risk inhibiting those adjustments and
be viewed as an attempt to support overly optimistic investor and lender behavior. Indeed, if
corporate bond and equity prices rallied substantially, such a move could potentially court
another sharp correction at a later date.

1998-11-17,10,"(10) If the Committee finds the Greenbook forecast plausible and acceptable, with the
risks of upside and downside surprises reasonably balanced, it may wish to defer consideration of
an easing action to later in the year (the point at which the staff forecast assumes such an action
will occur) to allow more time to assess the effects on financial markets and the real economy of
the easing that it has already put in place. Leaving policy unchanged at this meeting, as under
alternative B, would seem even more advisable if the Committee were skeptical that aggregate
demand will slow to the extent forecast by the staff. There is some reason to be cautious in
predicting much adverse effect on spending from financial developments. As noted, a number of
indicators of market performance suggest that, at a minimum, the decline in asset prices and
worsening of trading conditions have ceased and, in many markets, notably including that for
equities, a partial reversal has occurred. Indeed, the Committee could well be concerned that
further monetary easing would add fuel to the rebound in stock valuations, which arguably has
already gone beyond fundamentals. Changes to date in private financing rates may not have
imposed strong restraint on planned investment spending and, although the increased cost of
raising funds in private securities markets has shifted borrowing toward commercial banks, the
growth of aggregate debt in nonfederal sectors appears to have been well maintained.
","alternative B"
1998-12-22,10,"(10) If the Committee views the Greenbook forecast as acceptable and the most likely
outcome, it presumably would maintain the intended federal funds rate at 4-3/4 percent, as under
alternative B. The announcement just after the last Committee meeting indicated that the
cumulative easing since September had appropriately positioned policy to promote sustained
growth and low inflation. The incoming data might be read, on balance, as providing no
compelling reason to change that view. Although measures of activity have been on the strong
side, inflation has remained damped. Slower wage growth, along with declining commodity
prices, suggests that price pressures and inflation expectations should be contained for some
time, even in the face of what appear to be very tight labor markets. Moreover, the points of
vulnerability to the outlook seem about as they were at the time of the last policy ease. Foreign
economies are expected to strengthen on balance next year, but a significantly worse outcome
cannot be ruled out. Strains in U.S. financial markets, for the most part, do not differ materially
from mid-November, with credit spreads remaining elevated and markets still comparatively
unsettled. As a consequence of the mix of incoming information and the wording of the
November announcement, market participants do not expect a policy move in either direction at
this meeting, and, absent an especially compelling case for policy action, the Committee may
wish to avoid surprising them-particularly before year-end when thin markets and a reluctance to
put capital at risk could magnify the effects of any policy action.
","alternative B"
1999-03-30,10,"(10) While financial market participants apparently believe that the Committee's next
move will be toward restraint, no measurable weight is placed on action at this meeting. As a
result, the 25 basis point hike in the intended federal funds rate of alternative C could spark a
substantial reaction in financial markets. Short-term interest rates would rise at least as much as
the policy rate, the prices of long-term debt instruments and equities could come under
considerable downward pressure, and the value of the dollar would probably rise sharply on
foreign exchange markets. If the Committee viewed inflation risks to be substantial, such a
market reaction might be desired as it would speed up the necessary adjustment of aggregate
demand. But if a more modest realignment of market prices were sought, the Committee could
attempt to shape market expectations through the wording of the announcement. In particular,
stressing that some of last fall's easing was no longer needed might limit the tendency of market
participants to extrapolate policy tightening into the future.
","alternative C"
1999-05-18,10,"(10) If the Committee saw a pickup in underlying inflation as likely, it might favor
the 25 basis point firming of alternative C. Even with what would seem to be a generous
allowance for expected productivity growth and with relatively restrained pressures on
nominal and real wages at projected labor resource utilization rates, the staff still foresees a
gradual uptrend in core inflation. The forecast implies that financial conditions must tighten
appreciably to contain inflation. Moreover, the April CPI may be a sign that the tendency
for higher inflation is stronger than contemplated in the Greenbook forecast. Although
most bond yields have backed up since late last fall, in other respects financial market
conditions have eased since the Committee's last reduction in the federal funds rate, and
economic activity both here and abroad has proven more buoyant than anticipated. The
renewed appetite for risk in financial markets and apparently relentless upward march of the
stock market in recent months may suggest the possibility that financial conditions will be
more accommodative than in the staff outlook. In this context, the Committee may believe
that tightening policy now would be prudent in light of the significant risk that substantial
economic imbalances would build if the Committee postponed action until higher inflation
became more evident in the data.
","alternative C"
1999-08-24,10,"(10) The staff forecast suggests that there are substantial risks that price pressures
will be intensifying and by enough to require an appreciable tightening of policy ultimately
to stabilize inflation. If the Committee shares these concerns, it might see little to be gained
from delaying policy action and choose the 1/4 percentage point firming of alternative C
as an appropriate down payment. Even a sense that inflation risks were less pronounced
than in the staff forecast might lead the Committee to the view that a modest near-term
policy firming was warranted. As noted, failing to validate current market expectations of
policy action would tend to erode prevailing financial restraint, which may be seen as risking
unsustainable economic growth and greater strains in already-tight labor markets, thus
heightening the odds of accelerating prices. Given apparently mounting worries about the
secular imbalance in the U.S. trade position, the Committee especially might want to avoid
fostering doubts among global investors about the Federal Reserve's commitment to
contain inflation. Elevated market stresses apparently owe importantly both to uncertainty
surrounding the outlook for System action and some aversion on the part of traders and
investors to participate in the market in the fourth quarter. The former could be alleviated
by immediate action combined with an announcement suggesting little likelihood of
subsequent policy moves, while the latter might suggest that--because the Committee may
feel increasingly uncomfortable in tightening as the year wears on--action delayed now may
wind up being delayed for some time to come.
","alternative C"
2000-03-21,10,"(10) If the Committee were to choose alternative C, it presumably would also want
to convey to market participants that the balance of risks remains tilted toward inflation.
Such a combination, because it is widely expected, would tend to have little effect on fixed-
income yields and the exchange value of the dollar. Very broad measures of equity prices
over the intermeeting period would be expected to fluctuate near recent levels.
Preannouncements and announcements of corporate earnings will pick up steam in the
weeks ahead, likely keeping volatility in equity markets elevated, which could possibly feed
back on interest rates in a manner similar to recent experience.
","alternative C"
2000-08-22,10,"(10) The choice of alternative C would surprise market participants, raising
questions about the path for monetary policy going forward. Market participants might
wonder whether the Committee has read incoming data as more worrisome than they
themselves have or whether the Committee was intent on attaining a lower inflation
objective than investors previously perceived. The resulting upward adjustment to
participants' impression of the degree of future monetary policy restraint that is likely to be
implemented would be especially pronounced if the Committee retained a balance-of-risks
sentence emphasizing inflationary concerns. Bond rates, particularly in real terms, could be
expected to rise along with short-term yields, the dollar would probably appreciate further,
and stock prices would adjust downward. Conversely, a switch to a sentence conveying a
balanced set of risks would foster a much greater sense of certainty in markets that the peak
in short-term rates had been reached. In this case, the immediate price response in financial
markets would be tempered, apart from an upward adjustment of short-term rates of around
","alternative C"
2000-10-03,10,"(10) The market reaction to implementation of alternative C would likely be sharp.
With investors expecting no change in the stance of monetary policy at this meeting and
apparently anticipating that the next move will be toward easing, short-term interest rates
would probably jump by at least the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.
Especially if the announcement indicated that the Committee continued to see the balance of
risks as weighted toward higher inflation, capital markets could sell off significantly, as
market participants adjusted prices to incorporate expectations of a higher path for short-
term interest rates. Any decline in inflation expectations would probably offset only part of
the effect on nominal bond yields of the higher real rates brought about by the tightening.
The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would firm against most currencies. An
announcement of balanced risks would likely be seen by market participants as a signal that
the Committee believed that this phase of policy tightening had been completed. In this
case, the response to a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting would be muted.
","alternative C"
2000-11-15,10,"(10) If the Committee judges that core inflation probably will trend higher, as in
the staff forecast, and finds the likely degree of economic weakness to be less of a concern,
then it might want to act promptly to resist the acceleration in prices by tightening policy 25
basis points, as in alternative C. The need for action might seem particularly pressing if
core inflation were viewed as having already moved above the range consistent with effective
price stability in the long run. Moreover, the Committee may see a good chance that the
trajectory of prices may be steeper than in the staff forecast. In that forecast, underlying
inflation rises as productivity growth levels out and labor compensation continues to
accelerate, reflecting in part the catch-up of real wages to previous increases in productivity.
With the labor market quite taut and real wages having been held down recently by the
effects of higher energy prices on overall inflation, the pressures for faster nominal wage
increases might intensify more than the staff envisions. Any increase in inflation
expectations would accelerate that process. In that regard, the recent rise in near-term
inflation expectations underscores the risk that longer-term inflation expectations may not
remain anchored should oil prices fail to retreat.
","alternative C"
2000-12-19,10,"(10) While financial market participants expect policy to be eased early in
Committee will move to a statement of balanced risks, which would be seen as
opening up the possibility of a shift in the stance of policy in the near term. Given
these expectations, the choice of alternative B with a statement of balanced risks
should have little effect on financial markets. If the Committee instead reiterated that
the risks are weighted toward increased inflation pressures, investors likely would push
back the timing and reduce the odds and likely extent of easier policy next year. In
that case, interest rates and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would
move higher, and equity prices would decline. By contrast, if the Committee
announced that risks were weighted toward economic weakness, investors likely
would increase the amount and move forward the timing of expected easing going
forward. Bond and equity markets would rally, and the value of the dollar likely
would decline. With the Federal Reserve seen as alert for signs of economic
weakness, the response of markets to incoming data that pointed in that direction
might be accentuated.
","alternative B"
2004-03-16,10,"(10) In these circumstances, the Committee might choose to retain the January
FOMC statement essentially in its entirety, with only minor revisions similar to those

shown in Alternative B.  Given the incoming data, the Committee might wish to
acknowledge that the pace of new hiring has been disappointing but note that other
indicators point to continued improvement in the labor market.  Also, the Committee
might want to state that evidence . . .indicates that output is continuing to expand briskly.  If
the Committees sense of the economic risks has not changed greatly since the January
meeting, the wording of the January balance-of-risks assessment would seem
appropriate at this meeting.  Market participants would likely read such a statement as
confirming that the Committees economic and policy outlook is basically unchanged,
and any market reaction to the statement would probably be small.
Alternative C
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2004-05-04,10,"(10) The Committee has multiple opportunities in its statement to indicate
that the odds of policy firming in the near future are higher than at the March
meeting, as shown in the column labeled Alternative B in Table 1.  At the same time,
it might also offer a reason in the rationale paragraph why it does not see the need to
tighten immediately by noting that longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained
well-anchored.  With the risks to the outlook balanced and the economy potentially
picking up steam as the gloom that weighed on business investment and hiring
disperses, Committee members may feel that it is now appropriate to drop the
sentence referring to patience in removing policy accommodation.  Such a change
may be seen as particularly desirable if the Committee believes that investors
confidence that interest rates will remain low has been encouraging the development
of financial market imbalances that could have adverse macroeconomic effects as they
unwind.  However, members may be concerned that eliminating any characterization
of the Committees future action might lead market participants to build in outsized
expectations about the speed with which policy accommodation will be removed,
thereby augmenting the considerable tightening in financial conditions of the past few
weeks.  The Committee could convey the sense that its current outlook was consistent
with a gradual return to a neutral policy stance by providing assurance at the end of
the assessment of risks paragraph that, At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use
slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace.
Even with the inclusion of such a sentence, however, a statement along these lines
would likely lead market participants to bring a bit closer in time the expected date of
the commencement of monetary policy tightening.  In response, interest rates would
rise, stock prices likely would decline, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar
would tend to appreciate.
","Alternative B"
2004-08-10,10,"(10) In announcing implementation of Alternative B, the Committee would
presumably want to modify its previous statement that output is continuing to expand at a
solid pace to acknowledge both the softness in economic activity in the past few
months and the potential effects on economic prospects of energy price
developments.  One way to accomplish this would be to note that Although output
growth has moderated in recent months, the economy appears poised to expand at a solid pace going
forward absent significant further increases in energy prices.  With regard to recent price
developments, core consumer inflation was subdued on a monthly basis in June
although the twelve-month inflation rate was higher than a year earlier.  The
Committee may wish to retain the sense of its previous announcement regarding
inflation while not putting excessive weight on the latest monthly data by saying
Recent inflation data have been somewhat elevated, though a portion of the rise in prices evidently
reflects transitory factors.  If the Committee finds the staff projection of aggregate
demand and supply conditions plausible, it could reiterate its previous assessment that
the risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability are balanced for
the next few quarters.  The Committee might again wish to communicate a view of
the likely pace of policy adjustment by stating that, With underlying inflation still expected
to be relatively low . . . policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,
while also retaining the indication that it would tighten at a faster pace if necessary to
maintain price stability.
","Alternative B"
2004-09-21,10,"(10) Investors appear to have viewed incoming data over the intermeeting
period as pointing to continued moderate economic expansion and limited pressures
on inflation.  This interpretation of the data, together with statements by the
Committee and individual policymakers, has suggested to market participants that the
FOMC almost certainly will firm another 25 basis points at this meeting, will again
announce that the risks to sustainable growth and price stability are balanced, and will
reiterate the view that policy can be tightened at a measured pace.  Accordingly, an
action and an announcement along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B should
have little immediate effect in financial markets.  The conditional nature of the
statement makes it likely that investors will remain quite sensitive to key economic
readings, such as reports on payroll employment and consumer prices, in the weeks
that follow.  Should these data come in consistent with the staff forecast, interest rates
may well edge lower on the building expectation that less cumulative policy tightening
will be needed over the next few years than was previously anticipated.
","Alternative B"
2004-11-10,10,"(10) Regarding the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee might signal
the possibility of a pause by noting that the firming brings the cumulative increase
in the target rate over the past several months to 1 percentage point.  A mention of the
cumulative policy tightening would convey the sense that the Committee was
reflecting upon the extent to which accommodation had been removed.  Citing
cumulative changes is a device last employed in the FOMC statements of June and
August 2001.  The sense that the Committee was inclined to pause for a time might
be reinforced by characterizing the stance of policy as remaining somewhat
accommodative, rather than accommodative as in the September announcement, and
would seem to parallel the Committees decision in January 2002 when it first
characterized policy as accommodative when the funds rate was at 1-3/4 percent.
","Alternative B"
2004-12-14,10,"(10) If the Committee views developments over the intermeeting period as
having provided further evidence that the expansion is solidly on track, then it might
be inclined to continue removing policy accommodation at a measured pace by
tightening policy another 25 basis points at this meeting.  Should the Committee also
expect that substantial further tightening will be desirable fairly soon, then it might
want to issue a statement such as that in Alternative C, which does not hint at a
possible pause in tightening at coming meetings.  Despite the four policy moves over
the past several months, the real federal funds rate remains below the lower end of
the 70 percent confidence band around the estimates of the short-run equilibrium real
interest rate derived using the staffs new methods.  The current rate is also below the
estimate of the equilibrium rate that is implicit in the Greenbook forecast.  (See the

box entitled New Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Rate and Chart 5.)  These
revised estimates may suggest that a somewhat more rapid and substantial tightening
than previously perceived may be required to remove policy accommodation and head
off a buildup of inflationary pressures.  In addition, members may anticipate more
slowing in the underlying pace of productivity growth than does the staff.  Such a
development would add to upward pressure on unit labor costs, and hence on overall
inflation rates.  Also, the Committee may believe that effective labor market slack
going forward could turn out to be quite limitedfor example, if labor market
participation, which has yet to turn distinctly higher, fails to increase as much as in the
staff forecast.  In either case, the Committee might anticipate that aggregate demand
will continue to expand at a pace above that of its potential for some time and
consequently deem considerable further progress toward a more neutral policy stance
desirable over coming months.  Alternative C would also seem appropriate if
members were concerned that longer-term inflation expectations could move higher
were the Committee not seen as responding sufficiently to inflationary impulses
emanating from the decline in the dollar and the previous rise in oil prices.
","Alternative C, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative C"
2005-05-03,10,"(10) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for Committee
consideration that are listed in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A and B, the target
federal funds rate would be increased 25 basis points at this meeting.  Apart from
updating the description of recent economic conditions, the statement under
Alternative B could be quite similar to that issued following the March FOMC
meeting.  Alternative A would suggest that a near-term pause in the process of
tightening could be in the cards.  Under Alternative C, the federal funds rate would
be boosted 50 basis points, and the language would be modified substantially.  Some
variant of the wording of this alternative might be appealing even if the Committee
wished to tighten 25 basis points at this meeting if it also wanted to signal that its
future actions spanned a wider range of outcomes than currently envisioned by
market participants.  More generally, the Committee could use constituent elements
from more than one of these alternatives in constructing its statement.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative C"
2005-08-09,10,"(10) If the Committee agrees with the staffs assessment that a small amount of
slack remains in the economy and that the current configuration of financial asset
prices is likely to prove consistent with the expansion of aggregate spending coming
into line with potential output growth before long, it may be attracted to the 25-basis-
point firming and statement language of Alternative B.  Investors currently anticipate
a quarter-point move at this meeting followed by several additional firmings
expectations that should be largely preserved by the combination of policy action and
language proposed under this alternative.  And, while recent indicators suggest that
the growth of aggregate demand has been surprisingly buoyant of late, the Committee
may interpret the relatively low inflation readings for recent months as indicating that
prices are not currently in the process of accelerating.  Although the stance of
monetary policy evidently remains accommodative, the gap between the actual real
funds rate and current estimates of its equilibrium value has narrowed considerably

since mid-2004 (Chart 5).  According to those estimates, continued policy firming at a
pace of 25 basis points per meeting would bring the real funds rate within the range of
staff estimates of its equilibrium value by November.  But even if members believe
that such a sequence of policy actions is likely to produce sufficient restraint on
inflation, they might judge it premature to send any signal at this time that the course
of policy tightening is nearing completion.  Indeed, in light of the recent indications of
strong economic activity, policymakers may have boosted their sense of the degree of
policy tightening that will prove necessary and may now even see an appreciable
probability that the federal funds rate will need to be raised for a time above its
estimated short-run equilibrium value.  Even with such an assessment, though,
members may judge that continuing to tighten policy at a measured pace, albeit over a
slightly longer period than previously anticipated, should provide adequate restraint

financial conditions as an overreaction to recent developments, inclining it to try to
reverse at least a portion of this accommodation.  Indeed, the real federal funds rate
remains below the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value (Chart 5),
suggesting that further policy tightening will be necessary even after a 25 basis point
move at the upcoming meeting.7  Considerable government spending will be
forthcoming to help rebuild the Gulf region, adding to pressures on resources.

that the FOMC may need to bring the real funds rate above its equilibrium value for a
time in order to reverse inflationary momentum.  A range of monetary policy rules,

incorporates time-varying estimates of a term premium that compensates investors for 
uncertainty about real rates and of a liquidity premium that compensates investors for the 
relatively poor liquidity of TIPS.  Both estimates are obtained from a three-factor arbitrage-
free term-structure model.
Monetary Policy Announcements and External Events 
 
There is precedent for the Committee to allude to significant external events in 
its monetary policy announcement.  For example, in December 1999, the Federal 
Reserve announced that in light of market uncertainties associated with the 
century date change, the Committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in 
order to indicate that the focus of policy in the intermeeting period must be 
ensuring a smooth transition into the Year 2000.  On September 17, 2001, the 
Committee cited the tragic events of the previous week.  And in January, 
March, and May 2003, the monetary policy statements referred variously to oil 
price premiums, geopolitical uncertainties, and the hostilities in Iraq.  
Indeed, in its announcement that March, the Committee temporarily suspended 
its practice of specifying the balance of risks to its dual objectives in light of the 
elevated uncertainty surrounding the situation in Iraq. 
 
The announcements proposed for Alternatives A and B are consistent with this 
pattern, citing the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina.  They also acknowledge that 
data on spending, production, and employment will deteriorate as the hurricanes 
effects show through in coming months.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding models projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.
Measure Description
Single-Equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 38
especially those based on an inflation target of 1½ percent, also point to a further
near-term increase in the federal funds rate and suggest more tightening in coming
quarters (Chart 6).  The Committees uncertainty about prospects for the economy
and inflation may well have increased in the aftermath of the hurricane, but probably
a few months will elapse before a reasonably clear picture of its economic effects
emerges.  Thus, unless the Committee sees the hurricane as likely to undermine
spending significantly for several quarters or morethe period in which a change in
monetary policy would have most of its effect on spendingor has serious concerns
that a rate hike might interact in a particularly unfavorable way with household and
business confidence, members might believe it prudent to continue to firm policy at
this meeting.

Committee members may be concerned that, in light of some signs of sharply higher
near-term inflation expectations and reports of greater pricing power, elevated energy
and other costs threaten to pass through significantly to core price inflation.  If the
Committee believes that a continued measured pace of policy firming will prove
sufficient to contain these inflationary pressures, it might be inclined to raise the target
funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting and choose language as in
Alternative B.  As seen in Chart 5, a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate
would move the real funds rate into the range of rates estimated by the staff to be
broadly consistent with closing the output gap over the next few years.  However, the

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding models projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the

proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.
Measure Description
Single-Equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Committee may believe that higher real interest rates and a bit more resource slack
will be required to contain inflation, making it appropriate to issue a statement
suggesting that more tightening is likely in store.  Such a policy course might also be
favored if the Committee viewed the current rate of core inflation to be at or above
the upper limit of a range consistent with price stability.  With most measures of labor
compensation posting moderate gains and some reversal of the runup in energy prices
in prospect, members may believe that remaining firming can be done gradually,
consistent with the measured pace language of Alternative B.  While a policy hike at
this meeting would place the funds rate at the high end of the prescriptions of several
policy rules that are based on a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, that is
only a matter of timing because those rules indicate a need for an even higher funds
rate by mid-2006 (Chart 6).
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative B"
2005-12-13,10,"(10) The Committee might believe that a 25 basis point firming of policy at this
meeting is appropriate for a number of reasons.  In the staff forecast, output remains
near potential, and core inflation, though boosted for a time by the indirect effects of
higher energy prices, ends the projection period near 1¾ percenta level that many
members may see as compatible with their price stability objective.  If the Committee
believes the Greenbook forecast is plausible and acceptable, then it would probably
find the 25 basis point policy firming at this meeting assumed in that projection to be
attractive.  Put a bit differently, the Committee may see the current constellation of
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 14 of 42
asset prices and interest rates in financial markets as likely to be consistent with output
running near potential and inflation remaining contained.  If so, then it might want to
ratify market expectations of a further 25 basis point tightening at this meeting.  Of
course, should the Committees outlook have changed significantly since the
November meeting, it might wish to select a different setting for its policy instrument
than assumed in the alternatives discussed below.
Alternative B
","Alternative B"
2006-03-27,10,"(10) If the Committee agrees with the staff forecast and views the outcomes in
this projection to be acceptable, then it may wish to raise the target rate a quarter
point at this meeting and signal the possibility of some subsequent tightening, as in
Alternative B.  The Committee may believe that it has already brought the real
federal funds rate near its equilibrium level, a perception consistent with the range of
staff estimates shown in Chart 5.  But the Committee may also believe that inflation is
running in the upper end of the range consistent with price stability, thereby making a
higher real funds rate desirable.  If the Committee shared the staff assessment that
resource slack had been about eliminated, then it might want to be especially vigilant
concerning the risks to inflation from upside surprises in aggregate demand.  More
generally, if members view the current configuration of market expectations for policy
and its consequences for asset prices as appropriate given the economic outlook, then
they may wish to confirm these expectations by choosing this alternative.
","Alternative B"
2006-12-12,10,"(10) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, associated with the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A
and B, the Committee would leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this
meeting; Alternative A would imply that the risks to economic growth and inflation
were now judged to be broadly balanced, whereas Alternative B would again indicate
that the risks to inflation remained of greatest concern.  Under Alternative C, the
Committee would increase the target rate 25 basis points at this meeting and continue
to emphasize the presence of upside risks to inflation.  The employment report for
November will be published the day after this document is completed; a revised draft
of Table 1 will be circulated if warranted by those data.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1970-11-17,11,"(11) The choice to be made among the range of alternatives
summarized in paragraph (10) would appear to depend to an important
extent on the trend rate of growth that the Committee desires for money
and bank credit over a longer period of time. As earlier noted, if the
FOMC wished to remain on a 5 per cent growth trend for money stock, it
might accept a slower rate in the fourth quarter and a more rapid rate
in the first quarter in the interest of not unduly wrenching money and
credit markets. If the FOMC's basic desired path, on the other hand,
were to move up to a trend rate of growth that was about 6-7 per cent
for money in the fourth and first quarters taken together, the Committee
might then wish to be more aggressive with respect to reserve provision
in the fourth quarter in order to effect a smooth adjustment to the more
rapid money supply growth path. Two broad alternatives are discussed in
the next two subsections: one (alternative A) calls for maintaining the
target for money growth for the fourth and first quarters taken together
at a 5 per cent annual rate; the other (alternative B) calls for a higher
average rate of growth over that time span.
Policy alternative A. (12) If the Committee wishes to stay
on a 5 per cent growth path for the money supply, but is wiling to
permit some shortfall in the fourth quarter which would be made up in
the first quarter, it might consider the following language for the
second paragraph of the directive:
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and
moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expan-
sion over the months ahead, WITH ALLOWANCE FOR TEMPORARY
SHIFTS IN MONEY AND CREDIT DEMANDS RELATED TO THE AUTO
STRIKE. System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view
to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions
consistent with those objectives-[DEL:taking account of the
forthcoming Treasury financings.""]
This alternative might be best achieved if the Federal funds rate were
permitted to move progressively downward in a 5-3/4 - 5 per cent range
over the weeks ahead in the interest of attaining the Committee's longer-
run money supply and bank credit objectives. As noted earlier, our
estimates would suggest that a 5 per cent funds rate may be required to
achieve 4 per cent money growth over the fourth quarter. At such a
funds rate, it would be expected that this money growth shortfall might
be made up in the first quarter without any very substantial further
alteration of money market conditions. But in view of uncertainties
about the funds rate-deposit relationship and given the possibility of
exaggerated market reactions, it may be prudent to work the funds rate
down gradually between now and the next meeting while checking incoming
data to determine whether expected relationships are in fact developing.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1970-12-15,11,"(11) In the case of alternative A, the Federal funds range
is wide enough to allow for some tightening from recent levels. This
may be required to limit money growth in the first quarter to 5 per
cent should the Greenbook projection of a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate
of growth in nominal GNP in the first quarter be realized. Since the
last meeting of the Committee, the demand for money has proven to be
somewhat stronger, at given Federal funds rates, than the staff antici-
pated. This greater demand may have been temporary, however, resulting
from a sudden surge in financial market transactions, as noted earlier.
Because of uncertainties as to the source of recent money demand and as
to transactions needs associated with such a large bulge in prospective
GNP growth, a fairly wide Federal funds rate range is also shown for
alternatives B and C. If demand for money at given Federal funds rates
continues to be greater than anticipated--as a result of financial
transactions or the need to finance a temporary large post-strike bulge
in GNP--the Committee may be faced with the possibility of either per-
mitting the Federal funds rate to rise above the ranges shown in
paragraph (10) for any particular alternative chosen, or permitting,
at least temporarily, a higher money growth rate than contemplated.
","alternative A, alternative c"
1971-03-09,11,"(11) Under all of the alternatives growth in money supply--whether
M1 or M2--would be expected to slow over coming months from the unusually rapid
February rates of increase. However, as indicated in the preceding paragraph,
under alternative A, M1 would be expected to grow more rapidly in the second
quarter than in the first. With short-term interest rates persisting around
current levels, the willingness of the public to hold cash seems likely to

increase, given transactions needs associated with staff GNP projections,
an opportunity cost of holding money lower on average in the second quarter
than in the first, and the probablity that expectations of rising interest
rates (and falling capital values) would become more pervasive in an expanding
economic situation. Growth in M2 would be expected to moderate from the first
quarter pace, even under alternative A, however, as the initial asset ad-
justment by the public to the sharp drop of late 1970 and early 1971 in market
rates relative to time deposit offering rates runs it course.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1971-06-08,11,"(11) A tightening of the money market between now and mid-year
to the degrees indicated by the suggested specifications for alternatives B
and C would have little effect on growth in M1 during June, but would begin
to have more noticeable effects in ensuing months.1/ Under alternative B the
M 1 growth rate in the third quarter would be expected to be reduced to 9-1/2 per
cent and under alternative C to 8 per cent. However, by late summer or early
fall, it is our best estimate that the growth rate would be sharply reduced,
perhaps in alternative C to only about a 3--4 per cent annual rate, although
there are great difficulties of course in pinpointing exact months in which
low growth rates would be likely to emerge. Growth at such low rates would
continue for some months as sharply higher short-term interest rates gradually
reduce the demand for money balances and as higher long-term interest rates
over the next few months and possibly weakness in the stock market depress
individuals' net worth (which also reduces money demand). Thus, during fall
the money supply could be growing considerably less than might be desired
unless interest rates were moved sharply downward in the interim.
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative C"
1971-06-29,11,"(11) With the corporate calendar tending to moderate, corporate
bond yields could decline under the conditions of alternative A, especially
if there were no general rise in the prime rate, or if the rise was limited
to only 1/4 of a percentage point. Any significant drop in corporate rates
would tend to moderate upward pressures in the municipal and mortgage markets.
Alternative B money market conditions(particularly if the funds rate moves
to the upper end of the range) would reduce the likelihood of any rally
in the corporate bond market over the near-term, and could cause such
yields to back up somewhat, at least for a time. The higher Federal funds
rate would also probably lead to increased yields on U.S. Government
securities as the cost to banks and dealers of participating in the forth-
coming Treasury financings rises. Under alternative C, substantial across-
the-board increases in long-term interest rates would be highly likely. A
rise in the Federal funds rate of the size specified would be viewed by the
market as a marked tightening in monetary policy. It would seem to signal
a rise in the discount rate, would bring the viability of even a 6 per cent
bank prime rate under question, and would represent a sizable movement
toward the point where the remaining Regulation Q ceilings on longer
maturity CD's would begin to bite.
Possible directive language
","alternative A, Alternative B, alternative C"
1971-10-19,11,"(11) The bank credit proxy in the fourth quarter is expected
to grow less rapidly than in the third quarter under any of the alternatives;
under alternative A, the growth rate is projected to drop below 5 per cent.
The slowing in growth reflects mainly a turn-around in the availability of
U.S. Government deposits to finance credit expansion; these deposits are
expected to decline irregularly in the fourth quarter following a sub-
stantial rise in the third. Growth in time deposits other than large
CD's is expected to remain moderate in the fourth quarter, with growth rates
somewhat larger under alternativesB and C as a result of the lower market
interest rates likely to develop.
","alternative A"
1972-01-11,11,"(11) Since effects on money market conditions would be a
secondary consideration in the Manager's operations under alternative B,
the Committee need not prejudge the direction of the funds rate, as would
be the case under alternative A. Depending on developments affecting the
demand for money, the funds rate under this procedure might rise or fall
from currently prevailing levels, and the rate movements could be sub-
stantial. Therefore, the Committee might wish to place a lower and upper
limit on the funds rate, perhaps 2 and 5 per cent. These limits could
apply to the weekly average, with somewhat more intra-weekly volatility
permitted. In the period ahead--given past shortfalls in M1 and the
announcement by the Treasury in late January of its mid-February refunding
--the Committee might wish to instruct the Manager within the context of
this directive to err on the side of ease, that is, to show greater resis-
tance to interest rate increases than to declines.

1972-05-23,11,"(11) For alternative B, the mid-point of the Federal funds
rate range is just under 5 per cent. If the rate were to move up toward
that area, this would clearly impart upward impetus to other short-term
rates and bring expectations of a possible increase in the 4-1/2 per

in interest rates more than usually uncertain.

1972-08-15,11,"(11) Patterns of monetary aggregates, RPD, and money market
conditions are summarized for the three suggested directive alternatives
in the table below, with details in the tables on the two following
pages. Alternative C would set an RPD growth path designed to slow
expansion in M1 down to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate by the fourth quarter.
The staff's best judgment is that this RPD would be associated with a
sharply higher Federal funds rate, perhaps fluctuating around 6 per cent.
General interest rate increases resulting from such a change would be
expected to lead to further reduction in money growth to about 4-1/2
per cent rate in the first quarter of 1973. Alternative B would move
less aggressively to slow growth in the aggregates--moderating the ex-
pansion of M1 to an annual rate of 7-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter
and 6 per cent in the first. Under this approach, the response of
interest rates would be less marked than under
Alternative C; the Federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate
around 5-1/4 per cent, about 50 basis points above its recent level.
Alternative A would achieve the least moderation in M1 growth, and would
be associated with little change in money market conditions. Under this
alternative, M 1 would be expected to grow over the fourth and first
quarters combined at about a 7-1/2 per cent rate, the same rate as had
been specified for the third quarter under alternative A in the last
bluebook. Under all three of the policy alternatives outlined, M2 and
the bank credit proxy are expected to average close to a 9 per cent annual
rate of growth in the third quarter. Thereafter, the rate of growth in
M2 is expected to slow, as rising interest rates on market securities
become increasingly attractive to savers. Anticipated more aggressive
bank issuance of large CD's, however, would be expected to sustain the
rate of growth in the credit proxy during the fall.

1972-10-17,11,"(11) The suggested operating targets indicate ranges for the
two month October-November period for the average growth rates of reserves,
for average growth rates for money supply as variously measured, and for
money market conditions as represented by the Federal funds rate. The mid-
points of the RPD ranges are thought to be consistent with the mid-points
of M1 and M2 growth rates for each of the alternatives. All of the Federal
funds rate ranges encompass current money market conditions, with the range
being wide enough to make it reasonably probable that aggregate objectives
under the various alternatives would be attained. Under alternative A, the
Federal funds rate range centers on recently prevailing conditions, and the
staff would expect that realization of the targeted growth rates in the aggre-
gates would produce little movement in the average funds rate. Under
alternative B, the funds rate range is skewed above prevailing rate levels,
indicating our expectations that restraining monetary growth to the rates
targeted would induce a rise in the funds rate. Under alternative C, the
range is skewed even more in an upward direction.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1972-11-20,11,"(11) As noted above, the alternative B targets appear to be con-
sistent with about prevailing money market conditions. Even with little change
in the Federal funds rate, though, the 3-month bill rate might be expected
to rise between now and the next Committee meeting. In that period, it may not
quite reach the recent 5--5-1/8 per cent funds rate range, but the bill rate
could move above that range by the end of the first quarter of 1973 as the
Treasury undertakes large contra-seasonal cash borrowing. However, recent
greatly improved market psychology, as indicated by the ease with which the
market appears to be preparing for the announced auctions totaling $4-1/2
billion of new tax bills, may continue to limit interest rate increases.
","alternative B"
1972-12-19,11,"(11) Alternative B encompasses a 6 per cent M1 growth rate over
the first half of 1973, while alternative A involves a 7 per cent rate.
The 6 per cent target appears consistent with little further change in money
market conditions, but the higher target would seem to involve some easing.
In any event, money demand is likely to be weaker in the second quarter than
the first, partly because of the effect of the tax refunds noted in the
previous paragraph. In addition, under alternative B, Treasury bill and other
short-term market rates are likely to rise a bit over the first quarter, even
given prevailing money market conditions, and thereby work to retard money
demand later.
","Alternative B, alternative A, alternative B"
1973-01-16,11,"(11) The short-run ranges of tolerance for the monetary
aggregates remain on the high side of longer-run targets. For example,
in alternative B, the January-February M 1 growth is indicated at
per cent, as compared with the 5--6 per cent longer-run target. It is
expected that revenue sharing payments in January and the beginning of
tax refunds next month will exert some temporary stimulus to growth in
holdings of cash and time and savings deposits.
","alternative B"
1973-02-13,11,"(11) The Federal funds rate range shown for alternative B
represents a range around the prevailing 6-1/4--6-3/8 per cent. The
range for alternative C is meant to indicate, however, that the staff
would expect the funds rate to move up from prevailing levels to close
to the top of the range shown between now and the next Committee meeting,
as reserve growth is constrained. Consequently, in alternative A, a movement
of the funds rate down through the range shown would be anticipated.
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1973-04-17,11,"(11) The sensitivity of the current market is such that a
drop in the funds rate to the 6-1/2 per cent lower end of the alternative
B range is likely to be accompanied by a drop in the 3-month Treasury
bill rate to under 6 per cent and an accompanying decline in long-term
rates. On the other hand, a rise in the funds rate to the 7-1/2 per
cent top of the range would exert upward pressure on the whole interest
rate structure, including the discount rate.
","alternative
B"
1973-06-18,11,"(11) In the weeks immediately ahead, a Federal funds rate in
the general neighborhood of the currently prevailing 8-1/2 per cent rate
may be consistent with the specifications for the aggregates shown below for
alternative B. Under B, M1 in June-July is indicated to rise in a 6--8 per cent
annual rate, range with growth at a 9 per cent rate in June, but slowing
to about a 5 per cent rate in July. The slowing in July and the quite
modest rate of growth indicated for the third quarter in part reflect the
unwinding of the presumably temporary surge in privately held cash balances
engendered by the heavy income tax refunds. More basically, the longer-run
demand for M 1 is likely to be well below the second-quarter pace in lagged
reaction to the sharp recent rise in short-term interest rates and in reflec-
tion of the more moderate rate of growth in nominal GNP projected for the
second half of 1973.
","alternative B"
1973-07-17,11,"(11) Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected
to slow considerably in the second half of the year. Many banks raised
offering rates promptly following the increase in ceiling rates, but the
spread of market rates over deposit rates remains considerably wider than
in the first half of the year. With regard to the long-term certificate
without ceiling, there have been a number of instances of attractive and
innovative offerings. It is too soon, however, to evaluate the extent to
which such offerings will catch on at banks and with the public. For the
time being we have assumed that long-term certificates will make only a
modest net contribution to growth in consumer-type time deposits. Under
alternative B, a growth rate of around 6 per cent is expected for time
deposits other than large CD's in the second half of the year. And the
growth rate for M2 would be around 4-3/4 per cent.
","alternative B"
1973-08-21,11,"(11) The three alternatives include the same M1 growth rates for
the second half of 1973 as in the previous Blue Book. Alternative B repre-
sents a continuation of the longer-run growth path for M1 reaffirmed at the
last Committee meeting and depicted in the chart following p. 7-a. The longer-term

following the early July changes in Regulation Q ceiling rates. In addition,
the funds rate ranges associated with the three alternatives have also been
raised somewhat, reflecting in part the upward revisions in projected nominal
","Alternative B"
1973-10-16,11,"(11) Under alternative C, unless the Federal funds rate declines
to the lower end of the indicated range, Treasury bill rates are likely
to move somewhat higher, as expectations of additional easing in monetary
policy are disappointed. Upward pressure on bill rates is likely to be
larger in the event that the Treasury were to offer additional bills for
payment late this month or in connection with the mid-November refunding
operation (the refunding of $3.7 billion of outstanding publicly-held
debt will be announced October 24). Under alternative B, and even more
so under A, short-term market interest rates are likely to decline over
the next few weeks as market expectations of further easing in policy
are confirmed. Bank prime rates probably would be reduced, and some
further rate declines would be likely to occur in long-term markets.
","alternative C, alternative B"
1973-12-17,11,"(12) Among the assumptions we have made in working out the
various monetary and interest rate relationships are: (1) moderate growth
in large negotiable CD's, in some part reflecting the lower cost of those
funds resulting from the recent reduction in marginal reserve requirements;
(2) continued fairly strong short-term credit demands by business (at
least in the early part of next year when inventory accumulation is expected
to be strong), but only moderate business loan growth at banks unless the
prime loan rate drops relative to the commercial paper rate; (3) no Treasury
cash borrowing until March (unless foreign central banks find it necessary
to redeem sizable amounts of Treasury specials) and sharply diminished
Federal agency borrowing; and (4) moderate growth in consumer-type time
deposits at banks (under alternative C) and more rapid growth as market
interest rates decline (under alternatives B and A) as banks reduce time
deposit offering rates only with a lag.
Proposed directive language
","alternative C"
1974-03-18,11,"(11) In returning to the M1 growth path by September, alternative
B includes a growth rate for M1 over the second quarter of around 5¾ per
cent and during the third quarter of 5 per cent, averaging close to 5¾ per
cent for the six month period. Achievement of such growth rates is expected
by the staff to entail some further increase in interest rates as bank
reserves are held back relative to demand. Demands for money and for
supporting bank reserves over the next several months are expected to be
sustained by the transactions needs associated with growth in nominal GNP
projected at 5.7 and 7.8 per cent for the second and third quarters,
respectively. These growth rates do not include any upward impact from
lifting the embargo, and thus could underestimate money demand to some
extent, particularly by the third quarter. In early spring, there is also
likely to be some increase in private cash balances due to higher than
average income tax refunds. In moving gradually back to the 5¾ per cent
long run path, the staff would expect that reserve provision in the weeks
ahead would lead to a rise in the Federal funds rate to around 10 per cent
between now and mid-April and would be associated with M1 growth over
the March-April period in a 6 ½-- 8 ½ per cent annual rate range.
","alternative
B"
1974-04-15,11,"(11) Over the April-May period, M1 growth is likely to be
somewhat above the long-run path. Under alternative B, for example, M 1
growth is indicated in the 6--8 per cent range. These above-path in-
creases reflect in large part the sizable expansion in M 1 currently
estimated for April. Given the lagged relationship between interest
rates and money demand, however, M 1 growth is expected to moderate later
as it approaches the longer-run path.
","alternative B"
1974-06-18,11,"(11) The rise in interest rates expected under alternative C
would further constrain inflows of consumer-type time and savings
deposits to banks and thrift institutions, given current Regulation Q
ceilings. As a result, growth in M 2 and M3 for the second half of
respectively. Banks would be forced to raise interest rates offered for
CD's and Euro-dollars. However, we would expect considerable moderation
in the amount of net new funds raised through these instruments; bank
loan growth would probably be cut back by tighter lending terms, and
banks would probably become increasingly wary of adding to CD holdings at
ever higher interest costs. Marginal financial and business firms might
find it difficult to refinance maturing debts as banks and other lenders
become more selective. Financial strains would increase generally, and
the odds on failure of some of the more vulnerable firms would rise.
","alternative C"
1974-08-20,11,"(11) Alternative A contemplates a significant further decline
in the funds rate over the next few weeks, which would undoubtedly spur
a sharp drop of interest rates generally. Alternative C, on the other
hand, envisions a return of the Federal funds rate to the 13 per cent
area, and this would be accompanied by a re-emergence of market tensions
and generally rising interest rates. Dealers in U.S. Government securities
would, under the circumstances, attempt to liquidate positions enlarged
in the wake of recent Treasury financings.

1974-09-10,11,"(11) Given the market interest rates assumed under alternative
C, growth in savings deposits at thrift institutions would be expected
to remain barely positive, while net inflows of time deposits other than
money market CD's to banks would be expected to expand at a modest pace.
Banks have reduced reliance on money market CD's recently, and growth
in these instruments over the months ahead would probably be slower
than earlier in the year as bank loan growth is projected to abate some-
what. The reduced rate of expansion in economic activity is likely to
temper bank credit demands, although the needs of borrowers under
liquidity pressure could remain substantial. The recent Board action
to remove the marginal reserve requirement on large time deposits
maturing in four months or more is assumed to have a marginal effect
on the structure of CD's issued by banks, but to have an insignificant
effect on the total amount of CD's issued.
","alternative
C"
1974-11-19,11,"(11) Under alternative B, net inflows at banks of time and
savings deposits other than money market CD's would probably remain
fairly substantial. With offering rates on small-denomination deposits at
Regulation Q ceilings, we have assumed that the new reserve requirement
structure will not at present have a significant impact on the growth
of consumer-type time and savings deposits. The position of mutual
savings banks and savings and loan associations should continue improving
over the period ahead, as their deposit flows continue to recover. The
recovery in thrift institution flows, in combination with reduced bond
yields, would be likely to encourage some further easing in mortgage
market conditions. Mortgage markets would ease at a more rapid pace
under alternative A, since there would be a more substantial rebound
in deposit inflows at thrift institutions as market interest rates
dropped further.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1974-12-16,11,"(11) Because of the further weakening in GNP growth, pro-
jected by the staff, some further decline in interest rates over the
next few months now appears to be required to achieve the monetary
aggregate objectives of either alternatives C or B. Between now and the
next Committee meeting, alternative C would appear to entail a Federal
funds rate of around 8-3/8 per cent, and alternative B around 8 per cent--
the mid-points of the ranges shown in paragraph (7). M1 growth in the
December-January period under both alternatives may be on the low side
of longer-run growth rates, but growth would be expected to increase
somewhat later on as a result of the lagged impact on money demand of
the further interest rate declines.
","alternative C, alternative B"
1975-01-20,11,"(11) Alternative C assumes money market conditions as indexed
by a Federal funds rate centering around 7¼ per cent. M1 growth in
the January-February period under this alternative would be expected to
be in a 3-5 per cent annual rate range. A pick-up in M1 growth would
still be anticipated in February, but the rate of expansion would be
less than under the two other alternatives. Similarly, over the
longer-run, growth rates for money supply would be slower; for example,
over the first half of 1975 M1 growth might be at around a 5¼ per cent
annual rate.
","Alternative C"
1975-03-18,11,"(11) Consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and
thrift institutions would also be likely to expand somewhat more rapidly
than in recent months under alternative A, given the further decline in
market interest rates that is assumed. Meanwhile, banks may continue to
let large CD's run-off, at least until around mid-year, reflecting the
weakness in private credit demands, cautious bank management attitudes,
and the increased availability of demand deposits as well as other time
deposits. As a result, broader monetary aggregates excluding large
CD's (M2 and M3) would be expected to show more rapid growth over the
next few months than their counterparts including large CD's (M2 and M4,
","alternative A"
1975-05-20,11,"(11) The Federal funds rate range for alternative B is centered
near the 5-5 per cent area in which funds have been most frequently
trading in recent days. Given this funds rate, M1 in the May-June period
is expected to increase at a 7½-9½ per cent annual rate. The rate of
growth in M1 is expected to moderate in the third quarter, even though
nominal GNP is projected to expand markedly, as the public reduces balances
temporarily swollen by tax refunds. For the second and third quarters
combined, M1 under this alternative is indicated to expand at about a 7 per
cent annual rate. M2 over the same period would be expected to expand at
about a 10 per cent annual rate, as inflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits to banks remain sizable.
","alternative B"
1975-06-16,11,"(11) The relationship between alternative short-run operating
targets and longer-run objectives for the monetary aggregates is, of
course, a relatively loose one. Maintenance over the weeks immediately
ahead of prevailing money market conditions (as shown for the short-run
specifications of alternative A) would probably not be inconsistent with
the longer-run objectives of alternative B, but such an approach would
appear to entail the need for a more substantial constraint on monetary
growth later on, and hence a larger rise in the Federal funds rate later
in the summer. We have, therefore, assumed that maintenance of pre-
vailing money market conditions over the short-run would be more con-
sistent with adoption by the Committee of higher longer-run growth
objectives for the monetary aggregates, as shown under alternative A.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1975-07-15,11,"(11) The same one-year growth rates are shown for alternative C
as for alternative B--with alternative C implying a somewhat different pattern
of monetary growth rates and interest rate movements over the two six month
periods, as will be noted below. Alternative A includes a growth rate for
the June '75-June '76 period of 6¼ per cent from the current estimate of the
June '75 base. Thus, it is keyed to the mid-point of the 5-7 per cent
range adopted by the Committee for that period at its last meeting and, in
effect, ""forgives"" the June overshoot. This alternative implies M1 growth
from QII '75 to QII '76 of around 6-3/4 per cent.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C, Alternative A"
1975-08-19,11,"(11) During the immediate August-September period, growth
in the monetary aggregates is expected to pick up from the depressed
July pace. The limited data available for early August suggests
only a moderate acceleration, but the improvement in economic
activity apparently underway seems likely to result in more rapid
monetary expansion later in the month and in September. Under
the unchanged money market conditions contemplated for alternative
A, M1 growth in September is thought likely to rise to around a
of about 6-1/4 per cent. Under alternative B, the average 50 basis
point advance in the funds rate would probably exert only a small
dampening influence on the aggregates during the two month projection
period; the average M1 growth rate for August-September might be reduced
to nearly 5-3/4 per cent. The steep rise in the funds rate contemplated
under alternative C--to a 7-1/4 per cent average in the weeks immediately
ahead--would be expected to exert a more pronounced restraint on near-
term monetary growth. M1 expansion might be held to an annual rate of
about 5-1/2 per cent in September, giving an August-September average
of 5-1/4 per cent.
","alternative
A, alternative B, alternative C"
1975-10-21,11,"(11) The staff still believes that growth in M 1 will soon resume.
We are now projecting growth over the latter part of October and continuing
through winter, in view of the strong further expansion in nominal GNP, and
hence in transactions needs for money, forecast by the staff. Since the early
October level of M1 is so low, however, this growth would not be reflected in
the monthly averages until November. Given current money market conditions,
as under alternative B, the staff expects M1 to expand at more than a 10 per
cent annual rate in November. But since the level of M1 is expected to decline,

on average, in October, the two month October-November growth rate would be
relatively low--in a 3-5 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1975-12-16,11,"(11) Alternative A contemplates a decline in the Federal funds rate
to the mid-point of a 4¼-5¼ per cent range. Given the high rates of growth
in the monetary aggregates in November, such an easing in the money market
would be contrary to current market expectations and might be accompanied by
a sizable near-term decline in short-term rates. On the other hand, many market
participants may take the view that such an easing is only temporary and, to
that extent, declines in market rates would be limited. Under this alternative,
the staff expects that the funds rate would have to begin rising later in the
winter in order to attain the FOMC's current longer-run monetary objectives
and that the rate would be in the 7½-8 per cent area by summer. This
alternative, therefore, would ultimately tend to exert considerable pressure on
savings inflows at thrift institutions and banks.
","Alternative A"
1976-02-17,11,"(11) Little further change in market interest rates would be
expected between now and the mid-March Committee meeting under the
specifications of alternative B. The 3-month bill rate could rise
somewhat because a substantial part--perhaps half--of the Treasury's
very heavy cash need of around $15 billion between now and mid-April may
be raised in the bill area, where dealer bill positions are already large.
Upward adjustment of interest rates in the 2 to 7 year maturity area may
also develop, since the Treasury will be offering additional notes
for cash in the forthcoming period; a $2 billion 21-month note to be
auctioned next Friday was announced today. Yields in the corporate bond
market are likely to fluctuate within a narrow range, with little signifi-
cant change anticipated over the next few weeks in the flow of new issues
coming to market. The municipal market is still subject to substantial
uncertainty because of persisting doubts as to how New York State and
certain other borrowers will cover forthcoming financing needs.
","alternative B"
1976-04-20,11,"(11) Alternative C contemplates a gradual tightening of the
money market over the next four weeks to the mid-point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent
funds rate range in the process of moving toward lower longer-run growth
rates for the aggregates. In the short-run, however, the impact on M1
and M2 probably would be no more than minor because member banks would
respond to the reduced availability of nonborrowed reserves contemplated
under this alternative by increasing their borrowing. It is possible,
though, that a substantial upward adjustment in the Treasury bill and other
short-term rates would occur in response to signs of a sustained upward
movement in the funds rate. Under these conditions, if short-rates moved
well above the 5 per cent passbook ceiling rate, there could be sizable
outflows of interest-sensitive funds from savings accounts, particularly those
held by businesses and State and local governments. This would tend to drop
the rate of growth in M2 toward the bottom of the indicated April-May range.
","Alternative C, alternative b"
1976-05-18,11,"(11) Growth in M2 over the May-June period is expected to
remain relatively rapid under alternatives A and B. Nevertheless, growth
under alternative B--as measured by the mid-point of a 7-11 per cent,
annual rate, range--is expected to be slower than during the first four
months of the year. This reflects the higher level of market interest
rates that has developed as well as some shift of funds out of savings and
time deposits in payment for the $4.7 billion of new 10-year notes recently
offered by the Treasury.
","alternative B"
1976-06-22,11,"(11) Over the longer run, the outlook is still for upward
pressures on interest rates, particularly short-term rates. Credit demands
on banks and in short-term markets are expected to strengthen as the year
progresses--with consequent upward pressure on CD and commercial paper
rates. And by early winter the Treasury may have to finance itself
increasingly outside the banking system, even if some upward adjustment in
Regulation Q ceiling rates has been made by then, as we assume. As may be
seen from appendix Table II, under alternative B the staff would expect a
Federal funds rate of around 8 per cent by early next year, given a growth
rate in M1 from QI '76 to QI '77 of 5¾ per cent.
","alternative B"
1976-07-19,11,"(11) Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range over the
next four weeks centered on 5¼ per cent, the Desk's most recent objective;
alternatives A and C assume some easing and some tightening, respectively.
Under all three alternatives, growth in M1 is expected to pick up
appreciably in the July-August period, on the assumption that various
factors which appear to have depressed M1 balances in June--despite rising
nominal GNP--will no longer be operating. These factors include the lagged
adjustment of money balances to desired levels following the April surge,
the unusually heavy use by corporations of demand deposit balances to make
tax payments in June, and an unexpected and probably temporary slowing
in currency growth. Also, a draw-down in the first half of July of the
Treasury's unusually high end-of-June cash balance may add, at least
temporarily, to private demand balances.
","Alternative B"
1976-09-21,11,"(11) Alternative A involves an easing of the money market,
with the funds rate range centered on 4¾ per cent. Such an easing would
probably be accompanied by a decline in the Treasury bill rate to the
rate to around 5 per cent. In response to these market rate declines, the
bank prime loan rate would probably adjust downward. Longer-term market
rates probably also would move down somewhat further, but the declines
could be limited as borrowers accelerate offerings in anticipation
of a later reversal in yields. Primary mortgage market rates--which have
changed little in recent weeks despite declines in corporate bond yields--
would probably begin to drop noticeably.
","Alternative A"
1976-10-19,11,"(11) Alternative B, which has a Federal funds rate range centered
on 5 per cent, assumes that money market conditions remain unchanged between
now and the next Committee meeting. Growth in M1 under this alternative is
expected to accelerate into a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range
over the October-November period--in large part because of the substantial
increase that has already occurred in early October. Moreover, nominal GNP
is projected to expand at about an 11-1/2 per cent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, up from an 8-1/2 per cent rate in the third, and this should strengthen
transactions demands for money. Growth in M2 is expected to remain quite
large over the 2-month period, reflecting not only the projected rebound in
M1 growth but also the expectation that net inflows into time and savings
deposits (other than money market CD's) will continue large as market inter-
est rates over the next few weeks remain low relative to offering rates on
these deposits.
","Alternative B"
1976-12-20,11,"(11) Alternative A involves an easing of the money market
between now and the next Committee meeting, with the funds rate
dropping to the mid-point of a 3¾-4½ per cent range. Further declines
in market rates are likely to be generated, though such declines will
be limited if incoming economic evidence continues to suggest a more
vigorous economy and therefore leads market participants to believe
that interest rates may soon rise. Banks, in such circumstances,
may seek to issue money market CD's more aggressively--particularly
longer maturities--in an effort to lock in favorable yields. And
corporate and municipal borrowers may continue to accelerate marketings
of new bond issues.
","Alternative A"
1977-01-17,11,"(11) To maintain growth in monetary aggregates over the
QIV '76-QIV '77 period within the longer-run ranges proposed under
alternative B, the staff expects that the Federal funds rate would have
to begin rising by early spring, and would reach a 1977 peak of around
rates more generally that would be associated with such an increase in
the funds rate would tend to curb the growth in time and savings deposits
at banks and thrift institutions. As a result growth in M2 and M3 is
expected to slow progressively as the year goes on. At the same time
banks would probably begin to offer CD's more aggressively to accommodate
credit demands generated by the projected substantial expansion in GNP.
Bank credit expansion in 1977 is likely to be considerably more rapid
than in 1976, when banks permitted outstanding CD's to drop sharply.
","alternative B"
1977-02-15,11,"(11) Interest rates are expected to show little net change over
the next few weeks, though, given the specifications of alternative B.
The Treasury will probably raise $7-9 billion of new money between now
and the next meeting through routine offerings of 2- and 4-year notes,
additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions, and cash management
bills. Much of this need has probably already been discounted by the
market, but rates on Treasury securities could rise a little in the process
of distributing the issues. The municipal bond volume is expected to
remain at around the advanced January pace over the weeks immediately
ahead, but new issues of publicly offered corporate bonds seem to be
moderating in reaction to the recent rise in bond yields.
","alternative B"
1977-03-15,11,"(11) Alternatives A and C contemplate an easing and tightening
of the money market, respectively. A decline in the funds rate to the
midpoint of the 3 to 4 per cent alternative A range could be accompanied
by relatively modest reductions in other interest rates, if market
participants were to view such a decline as temporary in light of the
recent indications of strengthening economic activity. Rate declines would
be most pronounced in the very short-term area. A rise in the funds rate,
as under alternative C, could be accompanied by fairly substantial upward
adjustments in short-term rates--of about 50 basis points or so. Increases
in intermediate- and longer-term rates might be more modest, in view of
rate increases that have already occurred in that area and the current
relatively light dealer positions.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1977-05-17,11,"(11) We would expect the funds rate and other interest
rates, particularly short-term rates, to rise substantially after mid-
year, as the demands for money and credit continue to be generally
strong and the Treasury once again becomes a sizable net borrower.
By the first quarter of 1978, the staff anticipates a funds rate of
around 7 per cent under alternative B, if M1 growth is to be near the
mid-point of the Committee's 4 -6 per cent range for the QI'77-QI'78
period. This is a somewhat higher funds rate than the funds rate
projected for the first quarter of 1976 in the previous bluebook.
This upward revision reflects the need for greater restraint in M
growth over the last three quarters of the target period in view of
the 9¼ per cent annual growth rate in M1 now expected for the second
quarter. With the somewhat higher interest rates anticipated,
inflows of interest-bearing deposits in M 2 and M3 would probably
slow, and growth in these aggregates over the QI '77-QI '78 period may
be around the lower ends of their longer run ranges.
","alternative B"
1977-07-19,11,"(11) Under alternative B, the proposed Federal funds rate range
is the same as that adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting. If
the funds rate remains near the recently prevailing 5-3/8 per cent level,
the staff would expect M-1 growth for the July-August period to be at about
a 6 per cent annual rate. With the public's adjustment to the April bulge
in M-1 now completed, the transactions demand for money is expected to rise
more in line with the continued growth in nominal GNP. Growth in M-2 is
expected to be in a 7-11 per cent annual rate range during the July-August
period, as the time and savings deposit component of that aggregate continues
to expand at near its recent pace.
","alternative B"
1977-09-20,11,"(11) Alternative C involves a more prompt rise in interest
rates than alternative B and somewhat slower monetary growth rates over
the balance of this year. It contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¼-7 per cent range between now and
the next Committee meeting. With additional monetary restraint in place
somewhat sooner, the staff would expect interest rates to rise a little
less over the longer-run than under alternative B.
","Alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1977-10-17,11,"(11) The staff expects, however, that even further increases
in interest rates would be required as time goes on if growth in M-1
over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period is to be held to the mid-point of the
longer-run 4-6 per cent range associated with alternative B. This would
entail M-1 growth in the area of 4 -5 per cent, annual rate,during the
first three quarters of 1978. Given staff GNP projections and our assess-
ment of the likely strength of money demand, the Federal funds rate may
peak out at about 7 per cent in the second quarter of 1978, as shown in
appendix I.
","alternative B"
1977-12-19,11,"(11) Against that background, M-1 growth is likely to pick
up in the December-January period. Given the Federal funds rate assump-
tions of alternative B--where the rate is centered at the prevailing
level of 6-1/2 per cent--M-1 growth over this period is likely to be

in a 3-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent annual rate range. If the staff's December
projection of 6 per cent annual rate of increase in M-1 proves correct,
growth in the fourth quarter would be at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate,
significantly below the rates of growth for the second and third
quarters. For the year 1977 (measured from QIV '76 to QIV '77) M-1
would grow at around a 7-1/4 per cent rate.
","alternative B"
1978-01-17,11,"(11) Under alternative B, growth in M-2 over the January-
February period is likely to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate
range. With the recent increase in market yields, it appears likely
that savings deposits at banks, which were essentially unchanged in the
last two months of 1977, will remain weak in the early months of 1978.
Moreover, now that yields onmarket instruments are at or above effective
ceiling rates on all maturities of small denomination time deposits at
banks, growth in such deposits is likely to remain modest at best. But
relatively strong growth in large denomination time deposits included
in M-2 can be expected as banks offer these instruments aggressively
to offset slow growth of deposits subject to Regulation Q
","alternative B"
1978-02-28,11,"(12) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing
level of 6-3/4 per cent, as contemplated under alternative B, is likely
to be associated with M-1 growth over February-March in a 1 to 6 per cent
annual rate range. The February weakness in M-l, following several months
of strong growth, is thought by the staff to be transitory. Money growth
in March is expected to rebound to a little over a 7 per cent annual rate--
mainly because of the increase in transactions demands associated with the
projected strengthening of economic activity following the recent weather-
induced slowdown. The expected rebound in M-1 also reflects in some
degree projections indicating that the volume of tax refunds to individuals
will be large relative to other recent years.
","alternative B"
1978-03-21,11,"(11) The modest pace of inflows to thrift institutions
can be expected to persist in March-April under alternative B.
Growth of deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loan
associations, combined, may be around a 6 to 7 per cent annual rate.
Over subsequent months, the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings
would keep deposit inflows to thrifts from eroding further as market
interest rates rise. Reductions in thrift portfolio
liquidity and increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan
Banks and from other sources are thus likely to continue in order
to finance takedowns of existing commitments. Moreover, further
reductions in new commitment activity and in spot purchases of
mortgages from mortgage bankers and others can be expected.
","alternative B"
1978-05-16,11,"(12) Long-term rates are expected to show relatively little
change under the conditions of alternative A. Public offerings of
corporate bonds are projected to remain moderate over the coming
weeks, and State and local bond issuance should drop off markedly
in late May after the effective date of the new IRS ruling with
regard to sinking fund provisions of tax-exempt bond offerings. On
the other hand, the Treasury--after retiring about $2 billion of
coupon securities in the latest refunding--will probably raise about
$2 to $2 billion of new cash when it sells the regular four-year
cycle note in early June. In addition, the FHLB System will announce
terms for its mid-quarter refunding early next week, and is expected
to raise about $1 billion in this operation. Receptions for these
offerings could be quite good, however, since dealers have distri-
buted the bulk of their awards of the Treasury refunding issues
and have reestablished a short position in coupon issues.
","alternative A"
1978-06-20,11,"(11) Reflecting the 25 basis point ceiling rate advantage
enjoyed by them on the 6-month money market certificate, thrifts
are expected to be able to use this instrument more effectively
than banks. Both press and Redbook reports suggest that thrifts have
aggressively promoted the new 6-month money market certificate, and
sample data for early June indicate a moderate acceleration in
aggregate deposit growth at such institutions from the pace of recent
months. On balance, the staff is projecting that--under Alternative
A--the recent regulatory changes will permit thrifts to maintain
deposit flows this summer at near recent rates.
","Alternative
A"
1978-07-18,11,"(11) In view of the persistent tendency for M-1 to
grow above its longer-run ranges over the past several quarters on
average, a considerable moderation of M-1 growth over the next year
would be required to compensate for such overshoots and bring
M-1 growth to within a 4 to 6¼ per cent range over periods longer
than one year ending in QII '79. As can be seen from the lower
panel of appendix table III-1, the 6¼ per cent M-1 growth contemplated
under alternative B implies annual rates of expansion of about 7 per
cent for periods beginning as far back as the fourth quarter of 1975.
However, constraining M-1 growth over QII '78 to QII '79 to a 5¼
per cent rate, as under alternative C, would produce M-1 growth
close to the 6½ per cent upper end of April longer-run range for
periods beginning with the second quarter of 1977. As shown in the
lower panels of appendix tables III-2 and III-3, under all alternatives
M-2 and M-3 would grow within their current 6½ to 9 and 7½ to 10 per
cent longer-run ranges for periods starting with the fourth quarter of
","alternative B, alternative C"
1978-08-15,11,"(11) Under alternative A, the recent upward readjustment
of market rates, following the unexpectedly sharp decline of recent
weeks, may continue, with rates returning closer to their mid-July
levels. Basically, however, demands on credit markets are not expected
to strengthen significantly over the period. Corporate bond offerings
are likely to remain near their recent reduced pace, municipal volume
should drop off, and Treasury credit demands are not expected to pick
up until later in the fall. In short-term markets, the 3-month
Treasury bill rate is still quite low relative to the Federal funds
rate--a spread of about one percentage point--and the bill rate should
rise more than other short rates unless there is a substantial volume
of foreign central bank purchases.
","alternative A"
1978-10-17,11,"(11) Under alternative B, we would expect the Federal funds
rate to level off in a 9 to 10¼ per cent range by early next year if
M-1 growth over the QIII '78-QIII '79 period is to be at around the
upper end of a 4 to 6½ per cent range, abstracting from the effects of
ATS.1/ This represents an upward adjustment in the level of interest
rates forecast by the staff. The interest rate forecast might have
been expected to decline because alternative B in effect forgives
the ""overshoot"" in M-1 growth during the third quarter and, hence,
does not imply as low a rate of monetary growth over the next few
quarters as it did earlier. However, our previous interest rate fore-
cast assumed a fairly significant downward shift in M-1 demand relative
to income. There has been no evidence of such a shift in recent quarters,
and without the restraint of even higher interest rates than earlier
projected it appears that growth in M-1 (or M-1+) would run above the
alternative B range. Even so it should be noted that our new interest
rate estimates still assume some renewed downward drift in M-1 demand,
apart from the effects of automatic transfers.1 /
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1978-11-21,11,"(11) Expansion of M-2 under alternative A is likely to be
in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range over the November-December
period. The interest-bearing component of this aggregate will be
buoyed by shifts from demand to ATS savings accounts, as well as
by some expected shifts of funds from thrift accounts and other
nonbank sources as the public attempts to meet minimum balance require-
ments on the new transactions accounts. The total of other interest-
bearing deposits in M-2 is expected to moderate slightly from the third
quarter pace, despite the recent higher level of market rates of
interest. Issuance of 6-month money market time deposits (MMTDs)
and large-denomination certificates is expected to offset a further
contraction of nontransferable savings accounts and fixed ceiling
rate time deposits. Banks are likely to continue offering MMTDs
and large-denomination time deposits aggressively in order to finance
their lending. MMTDs are particularly attractive to large banks
since their effective cost is currently below that on large-
denomination CD's by about 1 percentage point.
","alternative A"
1979-02-06,11,"(11) Expansion of nominal GNP over the longer-run policy
period, while projected to moderate, is still expected to be around
its cash balances back into line with growing transactions needs.
However, the staff expects that the demand for M-1 will not be so
strong over the year, on average, as to require a significant change
in the prevailing Federal funds rate if M-1 growth at the midpoint of
the alternative B range is to be achieved over the year 1979. With
nominal GNP projected to expand more rapidly in the first half of
next few months and then recede later in the year. Alternative C, on the
other hand, would probably involve an increase in the funds rate from
current levels to nearly 11 per cent in the course of the year. By contrast,
alternative A would imply a reduction in the funds rate, reaching
year-end levels about ¾ of a percentage point below the current level.
The staff projection of the quarterly pattern of the funds rate for
each alternative is shown in Appendix I.
","alternative B, Alternative C, alternative A"
1979-04-17,11,"(11) Under alternative B, M-2 is expected to accelerate into
a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range in April-May. This reflects the
expected strengthening of M-1, as well as continuation of the recent
pick-up in growth of the interest-bearing component of M-2. The
decline in outstanding savings deposits appears to be abating. And banks
are expected to continue to be more active in the MMC market, as seems
to be the case since the mid-March elimination of the rate ceiling
differential on these deposits. Thrift institutions' deposit inflows,
on the other hand, are expected to moderate in the months ahead, largely
reflecting the mid-March regulatory actions.1/ Thus, their commitment
activity is likely to remain limited over the near term, and in order to
finance mortgage takedowns thrifts will likely reduce their liquidity
and continue to borrow. Primary mortgage rates may continue to edge
upward as deposit inflows to thrift institutions diminish.
","alternative B"
1979-05-22,11,"(11) Under alternative B, the staff expects M-2 to expand in
a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range in May-June. Growth at the midpoint
of that range would bring M-2 to the low-end path of the Committee's QIV '78
to QIV '79 objective for this aggregate by mid-year.
","alternative B"
1979-07-11,11,"(11) The ranges for the money supply aggregates under
alternative B are the same as those adopted by the Committee in February,
except that the M-1 range has been revised upward to reflect a changed
projection of ATS account growth (including New York state NOW accounts).
At the time of the February meeting, shifts from demand deposits to ATS
accounts were expected to reduce measured M-1 growth by about 3 percentage
points over the year. Thus, the 3 percent midpoint of the FOMC's current
in measured M-1 growth caused by ATS is now expected to be about half
as large as estimated in February. The midpoint of the 3 to 6 percent
proposed alternative B range plus the revised, lower ATS effect also is equal
to an M-1 growth adjusted for ATS effects of about 6 percent.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1979-08-14,11,"(11) As shown in the upper panel of the chart on page 10,
under alternative B M-1 in September would be above the level implied by the
upper end of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ percent growth range for the QIV '78
to QIV '79 period. This would also be true under alternatives A and C.
However, as is indicated in the lower panel of the chart, if the longer-run
range is adjusted to reflect the downward revision in the staff's estimate
of the ATS/NOW effect from the original 3 percent to the current 1 percent,
the projected September level (under alternative B) is within, though in the
upper half, of the adjusted 3 to 6 percent range. For M-2, growth indicated
by the alternative B range would place the aggregate in September well
into the upper half of the 5 to 8 percent range established by the Committee
for the period QIV '78 to QIV '79.

1979-11-20,11,"(11) At its last meeting, the Committee decided on a target
rate of growth in M-1 from September to December on the order of 4 percent,
associated with growth in M-2 of about 7½ percent. The Committee also
indicated that somewhat slower rates of growth were acceptable. Of the
alternatives shown below for Committee consideration, alternative B involves
a November-December growth rate for M-1 that achieves a 4½ percent rate of
expansion from September to December, but with an accompanying M-2 growth
above the Committee's earlier target. Alternative C is based on a lower
M-1 growth rate, and includes an M-2 growth closer to, though still above,
the Committee's earlier objective. Alternative A involves more rapid growth
in the aggregates. Because only six weeks are left before the end of the
year, monetary growth rates for the year 1979 may not be substantially
affected by alternative policy courses, although these policies would
have an immediate influence on credit conditions and on the trajectory
of monetary growth entering the new year. (The tables on pp. 9 and 10

1980-03-18,11,"(11) The specifications of alternative B imply an annual rate of
growth from February to June of the monetary base and of total reserves of
about 7¾ percent and 5¾ percent, at annual rates, respectively. Member
bank borrowings might average around the $2½ billion over the next few
weeks; assuming that they then edge down toward about $1¾ billion by mid-
year, nonborrowed reserves would increase at about a 4¾ percent annual
rate over the February-June period. The level of borrowing and growth of
nonborrowed reserves would, of course, be affected by any changes in bank
attitudes toward the discount window. It is not clear whether the newly
instituted 3 point surcharge over the basic discount rate will tend to
encourage more willing use of the window, at least up to the point where
the surcharge goes into effect, or will encourage banks to be more
conservative for fear that unexpected events may force them to borrow at
the higher rate.
","alternative B"
1980-04-22,11,"(11) The specifications for alternative B call for a 6¾ percent
rate of growth of M-2 for the December-June period, and a 6¼ percent rate
from March to June. Such growth would leave this aggregate in June below
the midpoint of its longer-run range, as shown in Chart 2. The December-
June growth is about 1 percentage point below that adopted by the Committee
in March, as the expected continued sluggishness of money market mutual
funds is not fully offset by stronger deposit flows.
","alternative B"
1980-05-20,11,"(11) Alternative A calls for growth in M-1A at about a 7½
percent annual rate between April and September, and continuation of that
growth rate over the remainder of the year. For purposes of monetary
targeting between now and the July 9 FOMC meeting, however, the Committee
may wish to target a somewhat slower money growth of 7 percent for the
two months of May and June, given the relatively moderate growth that is
apparently in train for May. As noted in paragraph 9, such a growth rate
is not likely to involve any appreciable change in the funds rate from its
recent trading range of 10½ to 11½ percent. The federal funds rate range
suggested for alternative A is 10 to 14 percent. The suggested lower
limit is a bit lower than that currently in place to provide for some
operational flexibility. The proposed upper limit has been lowered to 14
percent on the thought that the Committee might wish to limit fluctuations
on the upside, given the recent shortfall in money growth and the apparent
weakness in the economy.
","Alternative A, alternative A"
1980-08-12,11,"(11) Alternative A is indexed to the 7 percent growth rate of
M-A for June to September that the Committee established at its last
meeting, while alternative B is a more restrictive specification for-
mulated in light of the tendency for M-2 to run high relative to its
long-range target. Both alternatives call for slower growth in M-1B
and M-2 over the next two months than has occurred in the last two.
Even so, under either alternative, expansion of these aggregates over the
third quarter would exceed the 8 percent minimum growth rates targeted

by the Committee in July, and the September level of M-2 would be above
the upper end of that aggregate's 6 to 9 percent QIV '79 to QIV '80 growth
range. The specifications of both alternatives embody an assumption that
the recent rise in market interest rates will contribute to a slowing of
the extraordinarily rapid growth of ATS balances and regular passbook
savings that has occurred in recent months. Growth of MMMF shares is also
expected to moderate further as these yields appear less attractive relative
to those on other investments. The slower savings deposit and MMMF growth
is expected to be partly offset by a pick-up in small time deposit expansion
as MMC yields rise and as growth in the 30-month SSCs continues strong.
These projections imply that the gaps between the growth rates of M-1A and
M-1B, on the one hand, and M-1B and M-2, on the other, will narrow sub-
stantially from what has occurred in the past two months.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1980-09-16,11,"(11) Growth in M-2 under alternative A is projected to slow
to a 9 percent annual rate over the balance of the year, a rate that
would keep growth for the year above the upper end of the Committee's
longer-run range. The expected slowing over the next few months mainly
reflects reduced growth in the narrow money aggregates, but the increase
in the nontransactions component of M-2 also is expected to be less rapid
than in the summer. Growth in savings deposits has already slowed, and
money market funds have actually been declining. The latter are expected
to resume growing over the months ahead, as recent increases in market
interest rates augment the average yield on their portfolio, but not at
the very rapid pace of late spring and early summer.
","alternative A"
1980-10-21,11,"(11) The growth of M-1A for September to December under
alternative A is so low, however, that it may be expected to be associated
with further, relatively moderate,upward interest rate pressures in the
fourth quarter.1/ To achieve the specifications for the aggregates of
alternative A, total reserves would probably have to remain about unchanged
from September to December and, given the near-term pattern of growth,
expand at only about a 1 percent rate from September to November.2/ Assuming
adjustment borrowing of about $1½ billion, nonborrowed reserves would be
expected to decline at about a 3 percent annual rate from September to
November. Such borrowing is likely to be reflected in a federal funds rate
in the 13 to 14 percent area, given the present 11 percent discount rate.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1980-11-18,11,"(11) Under alternative B, a funds rate in the 15 to 16 percent
range is likely to emerge over the weeks immediately ahead, and possibly
higher before the year is out. The 3-month bill rate may move up into a
reflecting in part continued relatively strong demands on short-term credit
markets over the balance of the year. The Treasury is expected to raise
about $4½ billion in cash in the bill market and $7.5 billion in coupon
offerings of 2, 4, and 5 years. Business credit demands may fall most
heavily on short-term markets, especially if, as seems likely, long-term
rates rise further under this alternative, inducing added restraint
on corporate bond offerings. Finally, continued intervention by the U.S.
to slow the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar--which
is likely to continue rising under alternative B--could generate additional
pressure on Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve or Treasury offers
securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1981-05-18,11,"(11) The projected slowing of real and nominal GNP this quarter,
as well as the recent increases in interest rates, should tend to retard
narrow money growth from the extremely rapid April pace. However, money
demand may remain fairly strong, and interest rates under upward pressure,
unless the economy is considerably weaker than the staff now anticipates
or unless the current level of interest rates induces another shift to
more intensive cash management. Even under alternative A--which involves
growth in total reserves from April to June at an 8 percent annual rate--
the federal funds rate seems likely to remain in a 17 to 20 percent range
over the balance of the quarter.1/ Assuming the present discount rate
structure, adjustment borrowing would probably be around $1 to $2 billion.
Continued high long-term rates may tend to induce firms to focus their
growing credit demands on banks and other sources of short-term credit
over the near term--although the limited flexibility of many borrowers
and a desire to stem the deterioration of balance sheets likely will
maintain bond issuance at a high level.
","alternative A"
1982-03-29,11,"(11) Alternative A, which entails growth of M1 at a 4½ percent
rate from March to June, would call for an increase in total reserves
over the quarter at about an 8½ percent annual rate. Assuming a decline
in adjustment borrowing to about $750 million, nonborrowed reserves would
expand at a 13½ percent annual rate over the quarter. A federal funds
rate of 13 percent or so would be implied, given the present discount
","Alternative A"
1982-08-24,11,"(11) Total reserves under alternative A would expand at about
a 4-3/4 percent annual rate over the balance of the quarter. This probably
would be associated with somewhat more rapid growth in nonborrowed than
in total reserves, assuming borrowing drops to around $250 million,
a nearly frictional level after taking account of seasonal borrowing.
For this level of borrowing to be consistent with no more than a modest
back-up in short-term rates may, however, require a drop in the discount
rate from the current 10-1/2 percent level.
","alternative A"
1982-10-05,11,"(11) The moderation in month-by-month M1 growth under this
alternative assumes that the rapid build-up of NOW accounts of the past
two months slows as households adjust financial asset holdings and spend-
unusually rapid rise in demand deposits of late summer will abate and soon
resume the downward trend of earlier this year. Even with a slowing in M1
growth to the 2-1/2 percent annual rate contemplated for the last three
months of the year, growth in the fourth quarter on a quarterly average
basis would be at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate, about the same as the pro-
jected growth in nominal GNP.
","alternative a"

observed 11 percent assumed rate of growth in M2 over the next three months,

would represent a substantial slowing from 1982's pace in underlying
M2 expansion (abstracting from the impact of shifts associated with the
new accounts). Such a slowing would appear to be consistent with little
change in short-term interest rates from current levels despite an expected
acceleration in the rate of growth of nominal GNP. M2 balances grew
unusually rapidly relative to GNP in 1982, and we would anticipate an abate-
ment of such liquidity demands in the course of 1983 as economic activity
begins to rise and consumer and business confidence is restored.
","alternative B"
1983-03-28,11,"(11) Partly because lagged effects of earlier market rate
declines have dissipated, we expect broad money growth to slow over the
months ahead (even abstracting from MMDA shifts). Nonetheless, judging
from recent behavior, we would expect demand to be sufficiently strong
so that an effort to bring M2 growth down to the pace of alternative C
might be associated with rising interest rates. However, a deceleration
to the pace of B or A might be accomplished with stable or declining
","alternative C"
1983-08-23,11,"(11) Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be
expected to trade around 9-1/2 per cent (the 6 to 10 per cent funds rate
range shown for that alternative retains the specification of the current
directive). Recent strength in demands at the discount window suggest
that borrowing would range between $700 and $900 million. Total and
nonborrowed reserves would be expected to show little change, on balance,
over August and September-with a small decline in August offset by a
rise in September.
","alternative B"
1983-11-14,11,"(11) M2 growth is expected to slow a little in November and
December under alternative B from its rate in October, when its nontrans-
actions component was probably boosted slightly by the October 1 deregula-
tion. Although growth of 8-1/2 percent over the final three months of
the year would represent a considerable pickup from the pace of the
previous three months, on a quarterly average basis the expansion of
M2 would fall well short of projected nominal GNP growth for the second
consecutive quarter; nonetheless, the resulting increase in M2 velocity
of 3 to 4 percent would not be atypical for this stage of an economic
recovery. M3 growth is expected to be sustained at, or a little above,
its October pace. Should the decline in the Treasury cash balance be
exaggerated because of debt ceiling problems, growth in M2 and M3 may be
somewhat stronger as banks seek additional deposit funds to support
credit expansion in the absence of their usual Treasury balances.
","alternative B"
1984-03-26,11,"(11) Borrowing at the discount window of around $1 billion,
or perhaps a bit more, probably would be associated with the monetary
aggregate specifications of alternative B, and nonborrowed and total re-
serves could be expected to increase at annual rates of 3 and 6 percent,
respectively. Given the current discount rate, the federal funds rate
would probably be in the neighborhood of 10-1/2 percent, although it
could be even higher in the next several days around the quarter-ending
statement date and also around the mid-April tax date. While immediate
transitional adjustments to CRR seem to be behind us, it should be
lasting impact of CRR and the lengthening of the reserve period on bank
reserve management policies.
","alternative B"
1984-05-21,11,"(11) The specifications of alternative B are expected to be
consistent with borrowing from the discount window continuing at about
$1 billion (apart from any special borrowing related to the Continental
situation), and with growth in nonborrowed and total reserves at annual
rates of 8-1/2 and 5 percent, respectively, over May and June. This
would likely be associated with a federal funds rate averaging 10-1/2
percent. Federal funds may continue to trade in a fairly wide range
around this level, reflecting in part the greater scope for expectational
and other influences in the two-week maintenance period. In addition,
banks might manage their reserve positions more cautiously (holding more
excess reserves or seeking to conserve borrowing access at the discount
window) should the banking environment become uncertain in the aftermath
of the Continental package, thereby placing upward pressure on the
funds rate unless compensating adjustments are made to reserve paths.
","alternative B"
1984-08-21,11,"(11) The specifications of alternative B assume borrowing at
the discount window remains around $1 billion. Given the recent attitudes
of banks toward the discount window, this is expected to be consistent
with federal funds trading around 11-1/2 percent or a bit higher. Should
uncertainties in connection with FCA raise broader questions about the
stability of the banking and financial system, even more conservative
reserve management might be expected, and the funds rate could run higher
relative to the level of borrowing or to free reserves. If the FCA
situation is well contained, though, and incoming economic data suggest a
moderation of credit demands, the funds rate could fall back some, given
prevailing levels of borrowing, as market uncertainties diminish. Over
the July-to-September period total reserves can be expected to increase
at about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate, while nonborrowed reserves would
rise less.
","alternative B"
1984-10-02,11,"(12) The specifications of alternative B assume borrowing at
the discount window remains around the recent $750 million level. This
degree of pressure on reserve positions is likely to involve federal
funds trading in the neighborhood of 11 percent, with trading on the low
side more likely if rates on alternative sources of funds, such as CDs,
remain relatively low, and if a calmer atmosphere in money markets encour-
ages banks to tap these sources more aggressively and to be less reticent
about use of the discount window. Nonborrowed and total reserves would
each increase at close to a one percent rate over October and November.
","alternative B"
1985-08-20,11,"(11) Under alternative B, both M2 and M3 would be expected to
diverge somewhat from the Committee's June-to-September specification
for growth at about a 7-1/2 percent annual rate set at the July meeting.
Growth of M2 is likely to be higher, around 8-1/2 percent, while growth
of M3 should be lower, about 6-1/4 percent. M2 growth has been boosted
recently by its M1 component, and it is likely to show some deceleration
as M1 growth slows. M3 growth, however, is expected to pick up a little
over the balance of the quarter as banks increase their issuance of
managed liabilities to replace declining Treasury deposits.
","alternative B"
1985-10-01,11,"(11) Alternative B assumes unchanged pressures on reserve positions,
with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window between $450
and $550 million and federal funds trading around 8 percent, or a bit higher.
Ml growth would be anticipated to slow to a 6-1/2 percent annual rate from
September to December. Available data for September suggest that some abate-
ment of the pronounced shifting to highly liquid monetary assets, including
transactions deposits, already is in train. This process would be further
encouraged if public expectations of higher interest rates on market instru-
ments and small time deposits, which seemed to contribute in a degree to the
earlier liquification, began to give way in the face of essentially stable
short-term interest rates through year-end. In addition, M1 could be rela-
tively weak in October if its unusual contraction in October 1984 indicated
the emergence of a new seasonal pattern (not yet reflected in seasonal
factors). Even with the slowing of M1 in caning months anticipated by
this alternative, growth on a quarterly average basis, at about 8-3/4
percent for the fourth quarter, implies a further decline in velocity on
the order of 3 percent, given the staff GNP forecast. Such a decrease
would bring the drop for the year to around 5-1/2 percent, about matching
the decline over 1982 that was unprecedented over a four-quarter period
in the postwar years.
","Alternative B"
1985-11-04,11,"(11) With federal funds continuing to trade around 8 percent
under alternative B, other short-term interest rates would probably show
little net change over the intermeeting period. The foreign exchange
value of the dollar also might tend to remain around recent levels, or
edge off particularly if incoming data suggest a relatively sluggish
economy. Under the latter circumstances, long-term rates might decline
somewhat further on balance despite relatively strong credit demand. The
Treasury will be in the market in volume to replenish its cash balance,
depleted by debt ceiling problems, and to finance the large fourth-quarter
deficit. Private borrowing meanwhile is expected to continue at near the
third-quarter pace. Business credit usage is likely to strengthen as
inventories are rebuilt and in response to enlarged merger activity.
Household borrowing, however, should moderate, reflecting a drop-off in
consumer durable spending. All in all, the debt of nonfinancial sectors
is projected to increase at an annual rate of a little more than 13 per-
cent over the fourth quarter, bringing growth for the year on a quarterly
average basis to nearly 13 percent.
","alternative B"
1986-04-01,11,"(11) M2 under alternative B would be expected to increase
considerably more rapidly from March to June than its relatively sluggish
rate of growth in the first quarter, partly as shifts to bond and stock
investment vehicles moderate as portfolio adjustments to the recent surge
in securities prices abate. 1 The continued moderate M3 growth under this
alternative presumes that bank credit growth will remain relatively sub-
","alternative B"
1986-05-20,11,"(11) Under alternative A, which entails discount window borrowing
falling to frictional levels of $100 to $150 million, the funds rate would
tend to move below the current 6-1/2 percent discount rate. An easing in
reserve pressures at this time would probably be taken by the market as
signaling Federal Reserve willingness to tolerate a substantial overshoot
of M1 in the context of moderate economic growth and favorable price
developments. The 3-month Treasury bill rate likely would decline to
around 5-3/4 percent, or perhaps lower, and bond yields could reverse
much, if not all, of their recent increases. In the absence of similar
interest rate reductions abroad, the dollar could cane under considerable
downward pressure in foreign exchange markets. Concerns about the future
attractiveness of dollar assets could possibly intensify under these cir-
cumstances, tempering declines in long-term interest rates.
","alternative A"
1986-08-19,11,"(11) The money growth specifications of alternative B imply
increases in both M2 and M3 from their fourth-quarter base to September of
around 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate, with growth in M1 at nearly a 14 per-
cent annual rate through September. Expansion in all the monetary aggregates
would be expected to moderate a little further in the fourth quarter, should
interest rates remain close to current levels as in the staff's greenbook
forecast. In that forecast, nominal GNP is projected to strengthen only
moderately in the fourth quarter, while the effects of earlier declines in
interest rates on money demand should continue to diminish. Under these
circumstances, both M2 and M3 are likely to remain fairly high in their
long-run ranges, growing perhaps around 8-1/2 percent from QIV 1985 to QIV
registering a record postwar decline.
","alternative B"
1986-09-23,11,"(11) M3 also is expected to decelerate from August to December
in the specifications of alternative B--to an 8 percent annual rate. This
slowing would be accounted for entirely by the reduced growth in M2; the
non-M2 component of M3 is projected to continue expanding at the average
pace of recent months. Bank credit growth should slow substantially over
the balance of the year as loan demand remains moderate and acquisitions
of tax-exempt as well as Treasury securities drop off. Thrifts' asset
expansion, meanwhile, is expected to pick up only marginally in coming
","alternative B"
1986-11-05,11,"(11) Growth of M3 under alternative B also would be expected to
slow slightly further over November and December, coming in a little below
the 9 percent upper limit of its long-term range. Issuance of managed
liabilities over the balance of the year is expected to be modest as the
Treasury rebuilds its cash balance at banks and as bank acquisitions of
securities remain below the unusually rapid pace over the summer months.
The use of purchased funds by thrifts may remain light if these institutions
continue to sell a large portion of their substantial mortgage originations
in the market. On a quarterly-average basis, M3 growth for the fourth
quarter would be about 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate, considerably below
that of the previous two quarters. The implied decline in M3 velocity
would be at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and nearly 4
percent over the year as a whole, the largest annual drop since 1982.
","alternative B"
1986-12-15,11,"(11) The outlook for M1 remains quite uncertain, given the extra-
ordinarily low opportunity costs of holding OCDs and the erratic behavior
of demand deposits. However, underlying conditions would seem to continue
to point to some moderation in M1 growth under alternative B from the
exceptional pace of recent quarters. With market rates fairly stable for
some months now, interest rate effects on OCDs are likely to diminish as
offering rates are reduced further and as the public's portfolio becomes
more fully adjusted to earlier rate declines. Demand deposit growth also
should subside, in part as compensating balances are brought into line with
lower interest rates. Nevertheless, M1 would be expected to grow in the
first quarter at a rate well in excess of GNP and its velocity would register
another sharp decline, on the order of an 8 percent annual rate.
","alternative B"
1987-03-31,11,"(11) M3 growth under alternative B also would be expected to
strengthen to a 6 percent rate over the March-to-June period. Inflows to
M2 deposits at banks are expected to be augmented by some pickup in the
issuance of managed liabilities included in M3; borrowing from foreign
branches should drop back from recently elevated levels, and overall needs
for funds are projected to increase reflecting in part a turnaround in
business loans now that much of the year-end bulge has been worked off.
The pace of CD runoffs at thrifts is expected to moderate as their asset
growth rebounds a bit from the recent depressed pace, though any intensi-
fication of concerns about the health of these institutions or their
insurance fund could work in the other direction. On a quarterly average
basis, M3 would grow at only a 4-3/4 percent rate, the slowest pace in more
than a decade and a half; M3 velocity, which has trended downward, would
post a small increase.
","alternative B"
1987-05-19,11,"(11) M3 growth is expected to average around 6 percent in May and
June under alternative B, keeping this aggregate near the lower end of its
long-run range. Expansion of M3 should be sustained by an anticipated pickup
in net issuance of large time deposits and other managed liabilities to
support asset growth at depository institutions. However, M3 growth may be
held down by increased borrowing by banks from their foreign branches, espe-
cially if foreign central banks continue to intervene heavily and place the
proceeds in the Euromarkets. Business borrowing at commercial banks, which
already has accelerated so far this quarter in response to higher costs of
longer-term corporate financing, is expected to continue strong. Some
bounce-back of thrift asset expansion from the depressed first-quarter pace
is anticipated in the second quarter, in part as higher mortgage rates boost
originations of ARMs, which are much less likely than fixed rate mortgages
to be sold into pools. Expansion of all credit to nonfinancial sectors, in
markets as well as through depositories, is expected to continue at around
a 10 percent rate over May and June, placing the debt aggregate just below
the upper end of its monitoring range.
","alternative B"
1987-08-18,11,"(11) M3 growth over August and September would be expected to
accelerate substantially from its unusually depressed July pace, to a rate
of 7 percent under alternative B. Bank credit should resume its expansion,
boosting issuance of large CDs. Demand for adjustable rate mortgages likely
will continue to support thrift asset growth, funded in part by continued
expansion of large CDs, especially if the recent tendency to pull back from
reliance on FHLB advances continues. Even with the pickup in M3 growth, this
aggregate would fall short of the Committee's current 7-1/2 percent short-run
range for June to September by about 2 percentage points. Total debt of
nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow in August and September around the
more moderate July pace, leaving the debt aggregate in September about 9-1/2
percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base. While federal
government borrowing has picked up following the debt ceiling disruption,
private credit demands may be damped a bit, especially in long-term credit
markets in response to the higher level of bond yields.
","alternative B"
1987-09-22,11,"(11) The monetary aggregate specifications of alternative B assume
that the reserve pressures of this alternative are maintained through year-
end. Under these conditions, M2 is expected to grow at a 4-1/2 percent rate,
near its pace of recent months. This would bring growth in M2 for the year
to 4 percent, well below the lower end of the Committee's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2
percent long-run range. Adjustments of portfolios to the recent increase in
open market rates would act to restrain M2 growth over the months ahead,
especially its more liquid components, resulting in a further rise in M2
velocity. Opportunity costs of holding OCDs, savings deposits and MMDAs have
risen appreciably over recent weeks and are likely to remain high owing to
sluggish adjustment of offering rates. Moreover, similar to the experience
thus far this year, demand deposits could well remain about flat, as the
effects of the expected growth in economic activity over the remainder of the
year are about offset by the impact of the recent upward movement in interest
rates. Growth in small time deposits, in contrast, should be well maintained
as banks and thrifts have been adjusting yields on these accounts more promptly
to those in the open market. Given its relatively large interest sensitivity,
M1 would be expected to grow at only a 3 percent rate over August to December,
implying quarterly average growth of 3-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter and
a 2-1/4 percent rate of velocity expansion.
","alternative B, alternative a"
1987-11-03,11,"(11) are subject to considerable uncertainties.
(11) Alternative B would maintain the easier reserve conditions
that have come to prevail recently; the assumption for adjustment and sea-
sonal borrowing would remain at $450 million, with federal funds trading
expected to center at 7 percent or a bit below. Additional easing would be
sought under alternative A, either through a further reduction in the bor-
rowing assumption to $250 million or a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate;
the funds rate would be likely to fall to, or a little below, the 6-1/2
percent area. Alternative C would involve some slight firming of reserve
conditions, with borrowing being increased to $550 million and the funds
rate probably moving back to around 7-1/4 percent.
","Alternative B, alternative A, Alternative C"
1987-12-15,11,"(11) Under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alternative
B, M2 growth from November to March likely would pick up from the 3-1/2
percent average pace of October and November, placing this aggregate
just below the 5 percent lower bound of the growth cone associated with
its tentative 1988 range by March. The decline in market interest rates
since mid-October has lowered opportunity costs on retail deposits to
around their summer levels. As the effects of increases in opportunity
costs earlier this year fade, deposit inflows should pick up. M2 is
thus expected to grow nearly apace with GNP through the first quarter of
next year, with its velocity essentially unchanged. This compares with
an increase in V2 that averaged 3 percent at an annual rate over the
first three quarters of this year.
","alternative
B"
1988-03-29,11,"(11) Given the financial conditions associated with alternative
B, M2 and M3 are expected to grow at 7 and 6-1/2 percent annual rates,
respectively, from March to June, leaving them well into the upper halves
of their 4 to 8 percent annual ranges. Although the broader aggregates
would be expected to slow somewhat from the pace of the last three months,
important impetus to growth of M2 will continue to be the reduced oppor-
tunity cost of holding retail interest-bearing accounts. To be sure,
opportunity costs are likely to widen a little once again in coming months
as returns on retail balances edge off further in lagged response to the
previous decline in market rates. Nevertheless, the expected second-quar-
ter spread between market rates and the average return on retail balances
in M2 still would represent a very substantial reduction from its peak in
the third quarter of last year. Inflows to these accounts might be sup-
ported by other influences as well: the personal saving rate is projected
to remain high relative to last year, and additions to IRAs should be
considerably smaller than in recent years in response to tightened tax-
reform restrictions.
","alternative
B"
1988-05-17,11,"(11) M3 growth should moderate to around a 6-1/4 percent rate over
May and June under alternative B. Money market mutual funds in M3 probably
will decline further for a while as returns lag behind recently elevated
short-term market rates. The drop in core deposit inflows in May and June
is likely to be only partly offset by increased issuance of managed liabili-
ties by banks and thrifts because depository institution credit is antici-
pated to slow. At banks, business loan growth, though likely to remain
strong given the rise in bond rates, should drop back from the April pace,
which was boosted by an extraordinary volume of merger-related and other
special borrowing, and households may tap consumer credit and home equity
lines to a lesser extent in coming months with the scaling back of auto
incentives and the passing of the April tax date. At thrifts, however, the
restraining effects on asset expansion of the recent upturn in mortgage
rates will be cushioned some by a growing share of ARMs. Total household
borrowing over the remainder of the quarter is expected to edge down, while
overall business credit demands should remain robust into the summer given
the elevated financing gap and continuing merger activity. But with federal
government borrowing light over the rest of the second quarter, the growth
in the debt of all domestic nonfinancial sectors by June is expected to be
moving closer to, though still staying a little above, the 9 percent mid-
point of the Committee's annual range.
","alternative B"
1988-09-20,11,"(11) M3 likely would continue to grow at a 5 percent rate under
alternative B, and its velocity would edge up again in the fourth quarter.
A further moderation in credit growth at thrifts, and associated funding
needs, is likely to be offset by some pickup in bank credit, as lending to
businesses and securities acquisitions rebound following weakness over July
and August. Total borrowing by businesses is expected to strengthen some-
what over the balance of the year, reflecting larger external financing
needs and substantial further share retirements, with credit demands still
focused to a large extent on the short- and intermediate-term markets.
Domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to rise at a 8-1/2 percent rate over
the last four months of the year and for the year as a whole, leaving it
somewhat below the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range.
","alternative B"
1988-11-01,11,"(11) Under alternative B, M2 growth would strengthen modest-
ly--to a 3 percent rate--from the 1-1/4 percent pace of September and
October, largely reflecting some turnaround in overnight RPs and
Eurodollars. In addition, growth in retail accounts in M2 would firm a
little; the damping influence of earlier increases in market interest
rates should diminish, in part as opportunity costs edge down with
rising deposit offering rates. M1 would be expected to be about un-
changed over November and December as demand deposits and OCDs continue
to run off through year-end. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would be
about flat in the fourth quarter and growth in its velocity would
strengthen to a 6-1/2 percent rate given the staff GNP forecast. M2
would grow at only a 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter on this basis,
implying a 4-1/2 percent rate of increase in its velocity. Such an
increase in velocity is a little larger than implied by the staff models
of M2 demand, which show the rise in interest rates from earlier this
year damping M2 growth in the fourth quarter by about 3-1/2 percent, but
within their usual margin of error. Under this alternative, M2 would
enter the year at around the lower end of its provisional range for
strengthen only gradually next year, remaining well down in its range
for some time.
","alternative B"
1988-12-13,11,"(11) From a November base, M2 growth is expected to average 4 per-
cent at an annual rate through March under alternative B, maintaining its
average pace of October and November. Liquid balances may be boosted a
little over the near term by the spate of corporate buyouts. This effect
should be minimal for M1, since share sellers are unlikely to keep funds in
idle or low-yielding balances for long. For M2, any such effects are ex-
pected to dissipate over the first quarter as funds are redeployed. Even
though short-term rates might drop from recent levels under this alterna-
tive, they would remain above those of late summer and early fall. This net
advance in interest rates and deposit opportunity costs coming on top of the
earlier increases would damp M2 demand in the first quarter about as strong-
ly as it was restrained in the second half of this year. Based on the
greenbook forecast for GNP, M2 velocity is expected to rise at a 4 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, near its estimated pace in each of the
last two quarters of 1988.
","alternative B"
1989-03-28,11,"(11) Growth in M2 under alternative B, at 3 percent from March to
June, would be stronger on average than over the first three months of
this year. As discussed above, deposit weakness at thrifts is expected to
continue, but to abate. In addition, with short-term market rates moving
a bit below current levels and rates on deposits edging higher in response
to previous increases in market rates, opportunity costs would be narrow-
ing, rather than rising as in recent months. Even so, the lagged effects
of earlier substantial increases in opportunity costs would continue to
restrain M2 growth and result in a 4-1/2 percent increase in its velocity
in the second quarter, somewhat faster than in the second half of 1988.
M1 would continue about flat over the March-to-June period as outflows of
transactions deposits about match growth in currency; consequently, its
velocity would increase at around the projected 7-3/4 percent increase in
nominal GNP.
","alternative B"
1989-05-16,11,"(11) Since market yields now appear to have built in some near-
term easing of monetary policy, maintaining current conditions under
alternative B probably would be associated with some back-up in short-term
rates. Especially if incoming information on activity and prices does not
seem to confirm the extent of the weakness apparent in the most recent
data, that rise could be noticeable, on the order of 1/4 percentage point
or more. Under these circumstances, bond yields also might retrace some
of their most recent decline, with the 30-year Treasury bond returning to
the 9 percent level. With U.S. interest rates possibly firming under this
alternative, the exchange value of the dollar in the weeks ahead could be
subject to further upward pressure, unless monetary authorities were to
intervene in a much more aggressive manner.
","alternative B"
1989-08-22,11,"(11) Under alternative C, market interest rates would back up
abruptly, given that the Federal Reserve policy tightening would come as a
surprise. Increases in short rates by more than the 1/2 percentage point
rise in the funds rate could well occur, as market participants reassessed
not only current but also future money market conditions in light of a
more restrictive policy stance than they anticipated. The advance in bond
yields probably would be more restrained in view of the implications of
higher short-term rates for future economic activity and inflation. Such
monetary policy tightening would result in some additional upward pressure
on the dollar.
","alternative C"
1989-10-03,11,"(11) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to grow at a 6-1/2 per-
cent annual rate over the September-to-December period, a little below the
recent pace. This implies quarterly average growth at a 6-3/4 percent
rate and a further decline in velocity at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, re-
flecting the lagged effects of earlier interest rate declines. Monthly
inflows to retail M2 would be expected to moderate as the effects of pre-
vious declines in opportunity costs abate, and as money funds no longer
are boosted by shifts from junk bond funds and by special promotional
efforts. Retail deposit growth at thrift institutions is likely to remain
sluggish owing to the less aggressive bidding posture of these institu-
tions recently. On the other hand, overnight RPs are not expected to run
off further and demand deposits might strengthen if compensating balances
need to be boosted by year-end to take account of the lower level of mar-
ket interest rates. Overall, Ml should grow at around a 4-1/2 percent
rate over this period, near its September pace.
","alternative B"
1989-12-18,11,"(11) The markets have built in some additional easing of policy
in the near term, and as federal funds continue to trade around 8-1/2
percent under alternative B, money market rates might firm a little.7
Any tendency for rates to rise is likely to be tempered if incoming infor-
mation points to sluggish economic growth, consistent with the staff fore-
cast, so that markets retain but push back their expectations of the next
easing step. Bond yields are likely to stay around current levels under
these circumstances. Bond prices could rally should more definite pros-
pects for substantial deficit reduction emerge from the upcoming Adminis-
tration budget as well as the implications of developments overseas for
future defense expenditures. With policy unchanged, the dollar might show
little further depreciation, unless key foreign central banks tighten
policies further.

upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would continue. Bond
yields would tend to rise, though with inflation expectations lessened by
the monetary policy tightening, the increases could be muted. The addi-
tional policy restraint might reinforce current concerns about default
risk on some loan categories, and would tend to encourage a further firm-
ing in credit standards, implying additional restraint on economic

1990-05-15,11,"(11) The easing of reserve conditions under alternative A would
tend to strengthen money growth over May and June to something more in
line with rates incorporated in the Committee's expectations at the last
meeting. Opportunity costs would narrow even more, boosting M2 growth to
nearly a 6 percent rate over May and June, leaving this aggregate notice-
ably above the midpoint of its annual range. M3 growth would firm to a 4
percent annual rate, keeping this aggregate a little above the lower bound
of its range. The easing of policy under alternative A would come as
something of a surprise to most market participants, and money market
rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds
rate. The dollar would come under downward pressure, and, absent incoming
information pointing to a weaker economy or a distinct improvement in
underlying cost or price trends, the decline in bond rates would be
limited, resulting in a steeper yield curve. If, however, evidence sug-
gested a softening in economic activity, perhaps reflecting more powerful
credit restraint than now seems apparent, the drop in short-term rates
would feed through to bond yields. The decline in market rates would tend
to buoy borrowing and spending by those with market access, helping to
offset the effects of tighter credit availability on spenders dependent on
depository intermediaries.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1990-08-21,11,"(11) Market participants no longer seem to be expecting a near-
term easing in policy, and short-term rates would be unlikely to move
substantially on balance with federal funds remaining near 8 percent under
alternative B. Absent a significant change in oil prices, long-term
interest rates may stay around recent elevated levels. Scope for a rally
in bond markets seems to exist should a budget accord involving signif-
icant deficit reduction be reached after all, counter to current investor
skepticism. The exchange value of the dollar would be unlikely to retrace
much, if any, of its decline since the last Committee meeting.
","alternative B"
1990-10-02,11,"(11) It appears that the expectation of an immediate easing of
monetary policy is no longer so prevalent in the markets, although some
relaxation still seems to be anticipated over coming months, partly
reflecting an expected budget accord. The market response to unchanged
policy under alternative B will depend crucially on budget developments
in coming days. Should an inadequate agreement appear to be in train,
rates could reverse some of the declines of recent days, but there would
be no effect from holding monetary policy unchanged. As noted above,
however, a significant budget agreement would extend the recent market
rally and engender expectations of near-term policy action. In this case,
maintaining unchanged money market conditions for an extended period would
disappoint these expectations and cause rates to back up.
","alternative B"
1990-11-13,11,"(11) Under alternative C, the dollar would retrace at least some
of its recent decline in response to a rise in the federal funds rate. A
tightening of policy would come as a surprise to market participants,
especially in light of the recent decline in the funds rate on the heels
of the budget accord. Short-term rates would generally rise by 1/4
percentage point or more, as expectations of further easing were extin-
guished. Bond rates also would increase initially. Quality spreads might
widen appreciably, with strains on lower-rated borrowers seen as being
heightened as the Federal Reserve appeared willing to tolerate a weaker
path for economic activity.
","alternative C"
1990-12-18,11,"(11) Implementing alternative A through a reduction in borrowing
would bring the funds rate below the discount rate and borrowing to fric-
tional levels. While technically feasible, this method of easing would
have some drawbacks. For one, moving the federal funds rate below the
discount rate might add to market uncertainties; it could prompt specula-
tion about whether this unusual situation portended a near-term discount
rate change, in part to restore more normal rate relationships, or whether
it represented a permanent realignment of the discount rate at a penalty
to market rates. In addition, the federal funds rate probably would be-
come a little more volatile. Increases and decreases in borrowing can
provide a safety valve, partly offsetting the effects on the federal funds

tial for such offsets, with their muting effect on funds rate variations,
is already quite limited, given the damped responses of borrowing to funds
rate fluctuations associated with the current low level of discount window
usage. Funds rate volatility would tend to increase a bit if borrowing
were reduced to implement alternative A. In any case, over the intermeet-
ing period the Desk's task will be complicated by uncertainties both about
year-end effects on required and excess reserve demands and about the
impact of the reserve requirement change on demands for excess reserves.
The potential for volatility in the funds rate under alternative A would
be reduced a little if instead this alternative were implemented through a

market participants, coming on the heels of recent easing measures, and
bill rates would rise by 1/2 percentage point. Private money market rates
could well rise by more and quality spreads retrace some of their recent
declines. In particular, a portion of the improvement since year-end in
the prices of securities of financial firms likely would be reversed by
the unexpected increase in short-term rates. Increases in bond yields
might be limited, however, by a sense that the Federal Reserve was taking
early action to check potential inflation pressures in the coming recov-
ery. In this environment, the dollar would be subject to further upward

1991-05-14,11,"(11) The growth of M3 under alternative B is seen as picking up
to a 3 percent average pace in May and June, lifting its March-to-June
rate of change to 2 percent. In addition to heavier projected inflows to
M2 deposits, rapid issuance of Yankee CDs seems to be resuming. Further-
more, the paydown by domestic banks of large time deposits, which was
especially pronounced in April, should abate over May and June. Under-
lying depository financing needs should increase as a turnaround in lend-
ing to businesses and households produces some expansion in bank credit in
the last two months of the quarter. Nevertheless, growth in overall
private nonfinancial debt is expected to remain quite damped, in line with
sluggish spending and reflecting the effects of continuing restraint on
credit availability and still-elevated loan rates at depository
institutions. In the federal sector, debt growth is expected to surge
over the balance of the second quarter, in part to fund enlarged RTC
payouts. Even so, total domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to grow
at only a 4-1/2 percent rate from March to June, putting expansion from
its fourth-quarter base close to the lower bound of the aggregate's
monitoring range.
","alternative B"
1991-08-20,11,"(11) Under alternative B, M2 would be expected to increase
over the balance of the quarter. On a monthly average basis, the
sizable decline in M2 in July would be followed by a small drop in
August and a 4 percent rate of expansion in September. Absent a
subsequent change in policy, M2 would be expected to continue to
increase at about a 4 percent pace over the fourth quarter, as the
anticipated strengthening of income offsets the waning effects of
earlier declines in rates; growth for the year would be 2-3/4 percent.
The recent easing would be expected to have its greatest effect on
liquid deposits, whose offering rates adjust especially sluggishly.
M1 is projected to increase at a 7-1/2 percent rate in August and
September, while outflows from the nontransactions component of M2
would ebb. On a quarterly average basis, M2 would be about flat in
the third quarter--well below the growth predicted by models of money
demand incorporating the staff's economic forecast--and its velocity
would rise at a 5 percent rate. M1, in contrast, would grow at nearly
a 7 percent annual rate in the current quarter and its velocity would
fall at a 2 percent rate.
","alternative B"
1991-11-05,11,"(12) The easing contemplated in alternative A exceeds that
now envisioned by the markets and thus money market interest rates
would decline, perhaps by at least 1/4 percentage point. Long-term
rates, too, would come under some downward pressure, although declines
would be muted if earlier market concerns about the stickiness of
inflation reemerge at some point. The prime rate probably would be
lowered 1/2 percentage point, still preserving the recently widened
spread over funding costs. The dollar likely would fall somewhat on
foreign exchange markets.
","alternative A"
1991-12-17,11,"(11) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B,
interest rates may exhibit an initial tendency to firm a little, as
market expectations of another modest policy easing in the near term are
disappointed. If incoming data tend to confirm the staff's forecast of
some slippage in economic activity this winter, however, expectations of
policy easings of the scope now contemplated by the market are likely to
resurface, restoring the three-month Treasury bill rate to around its
current quote of 4.15 percent. Similarly, the exchange value of the
dollar could edge higher temporarily, but would probably end up trading
around recent lower levels. Bond yields could well move lower on bal-
ance by early next year, as the market's realization of the extent of
economic sluggishness tends to reduce both real rates and inflationary
expectations. However, any such bond market rally could be derailed if
it looks as though a political consensus is emerging on measures for
substantial fiscal stimulus; the effects on bond yields would be
especially adverse if it appeared that such measures would undermine the
discipline in last year's budget agreement intended to produce smaller
deficits over time. Announcement of a significant shift in Treasury
auctions away from longer-term notes and bonds and toward bills would
precipitate some decline in bond rates and rise in bill rates--judging
from recent market reactions to such proposals.
","alternative B"
1992-03-31,11,"(11) The tightening of policy under alternative C would lead
to about a 50 basis point rise in money market rates, which likely would
be passed through fully to the prime rate. Long-term rates also would
rise and the dollar would firm, especially if the Federal Reserve's
action were taken as confirming views that a robust expansion was well
established with inflationary potential. On the other hand, to the
extent that market participants saw the early move as improving pros-
pects for disinflation or that the action would be reversed quickly
because it risked undermining an acceptable economic recovery, effects
on bond yields would be limited.
","alternative C"
1992-05-19,11,"(11) The more restrictive policy of alternative C would come
as a considerable surprise to market participants. Short-term interest
rates would rise at least commensurately with the federal funds rate.
Long-term rates might increase relatively little, as investors shifted
their concerns toward the potential for renewed economic weakness for a
time rather than inflationary pressures, in light of the signal of
Federal Reserve resolve to achieve disinflation gains. Stock prices
probably would slide as dividend streams expected by investors are
reduced and discounted at somewhat higher rates. Quality spreads on
private paper over Treasuries also could widen some from their current
narrow levels. The dollar would strengthen appreciably on foreign
exchange markets.
","alternative C"
1992-10-06,11,"(11) Under alternative B, M2 is projected to grow at a
last two months. Monetary growth will be boosted for a time by addi-
tions to demand deposits associated with prepayments on mortgage-
backed securities arising from robust refinancings and to OCDs from
the reclassification of sweep accounts However,
nominal income growth is projected to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Moreover, despite the special factors and lingering effects of pre-
vious policy stimulus, projected M2 growth stays below that of nominal
GDP because of the probable persistence of the forces that have been
boosting M2 velocity for some time. In particular, the further de-
clines in liquid deposit rates in prospect, in combination with a
still steep Treasury yield curve, will continue to encourage shifts
into bond and stock mutual funds from M2 balances. In addition, the
gap between consumer loan rates and deposit rates will stay wide by
historical standards, tending to foster a further rechannelling of
funds away from M2 and toward household debt repayment or avoidance.
The growth in M2 velocity in the fourth quarter of nearly 1 percent
would bring its expansion over this year to 2-1/2 percent. Were the
federal funds rate to be maintained at 3 percent beyond the Committee
meeting in November, M2 growth in the first quarter probably would be
on a trajectory below the Committee's tentative 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent
range, with continued sizeable velocity increases.
","alternative B"
1993-03-23,11,"(12) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to resume growth over
the February-to-June period. The projected 2-1/2 percent average rate
implies growth of 1-3/4 percent for the second quarter. With nominal
GDP in the staff forecast decelerating to a 5-1/2 percent pace, growth
in M2 velocity would slow to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter. Slower velocity growth partly results from the positive ef-
fects on M2 of the turnaround of the temporary factors related to sea-
sonal adjustment and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Their
impact, which represents a diminishing drag on M2 growth in March as a
whole, acts as a stimulant to growth in the subsequent months, reflect-
ing a reversal of the effects of seasonal distortions and a resurgence
in prepayments.4 On balance, these factors raise money growth per-
ceptibly over the February-to-June period. Much of the pickup in M2
comes from its M1 component, which would expand at a 10 percent annual

tightening under alternative C at this FOMC meeting. Bond yields may
well increase, but with the rise probably tempered by the sense that the
Federal Reserve was moving promptly to head off a resurgence of infla-
tion. Bill rates likely would jump by nearly the increase of 50 basis
points in the federal funds rate, and private money market rates could
rise a bit more, reflecting widening risk premiums. Banks would likely
boost the prime rate by 1/2 percentage point. Bank stock prices, which
have benefited from wide spreads between short-term deposit rates and
rates on longer-term assets, likely would extend their recent declines.
Overall stock price indexes probably would drop as well, and the result-
ing capital losses on bonds and stocks could restrain inflows to long-
term mutual funds, at least temporarily. The dollar would strengthen on
foreign exchange markets.

1993-08-17,11,"(11) The easing under alternative A would come as a surprise
to market participants, and short-term rates would decline by the full
decrease noticeably, and longer-term rates also would move lower, at
least in the immediate aftermath of the easing action. The fall in
longer-term nominal interest rates might be limited if inflation expec-
tations were worsened by a sense that the Federal Reserve was putting
less weight on its longer-run price stability objective. Even if
longer-term nominal rates were little affected, real rates across the
maturity structure would fall. However, unless the easing itself
prompted a more downbeat market assessment of the underlying strength of
spending, the drop in real capital market rates might be muted to some
extent by questions about how long the reduced federal funds rate could
be sustained, given its already low level in real terms.
","alternative A"
1993-09-21,11,"(11) This alternative might seem attractive if the Committee
saw the lack of progress toward full employment in the staff outlook
as unsatisfactory and was willing to settle for essentially no further
disinflation in this expansion; market perceptions that the Committee
had down-weighted its price stability objective could limit declines
in nominal long-term rates. Alternative A might also be chosen if the
Committee saw economic activity and inflation as possibly coming in
below the staff forecast; market perceptions that the Committee was
signalling an expectation that the outlook for real activity had
deteriorated and for disinflation had improved could result in sub-
stantial declines in bond yields. Although the longer-term effects of
lower interest rates on money demand may be uncertain, over the next
several months deposit rates would lag declines in market rates,
boosting money growth under this alternative and providing a little
more assurance that the broad monetary aggregates would finish the
year within their ranges. Given the staff spending forecast, M2 would
expand at a 2-1/2 percent rate over the remainder of the year, ending
the year 1-1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1992 base. The boost
to growth in income beginning late in the year would tend to lift this
aggregate further into its tentative 1994 range early next year. Some
of the more rapid growth in M2 would show through to M3 under alterna-
tive A, but expansion of this aggregate would remain quite weak as
borrowers continued to direct their credit demands toward long-term
","Alternative A, alternative a"
1993-11-16,11,"(11) The Committee might favor alternative C if strength in
recent economic data were seen as implying that any delay in firming ran
an unacceptably high risk that economic activity could develop excessive
momentum that would rapidly erode the remaining degree of slack and
produce an acceleration of prices. Even if growth in aggregate demand
turns out to be as moderate as in the staff forecast, a tightening would
better ensure a resumption of a distinct downward trend to inflation.
Under this alternative, M2 would expand at a 2 percent rate from October
through March of next year, leaving growth from the fourth quarter of
this year in the lower half of its tentative range. M3 would expand at
a 1-1/4 percent rate from October through March, also in the lower half
of its provisional range.
","alternative C"
1993-12-21,11,"(11) The rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C,
to 3-1/2 percent, would come sooner than now anticipated by market
participants and built into markets interest rates. Rates at the near
end of the maturity spectrum would rise by almost the full 50 basis
point increase in the funds rate; intermediate- and long-term rates
would go up, but as usual by less. The extraordinary spread of the
prime rate over funding costs and the more aggressive lending posture
of commercial banks suggest that the prime rate might notch up only
be limited because such a tightening at this time might be seen as
better ensuring continuing moderate expansion and disinflation in the
years ahead. Quality spreads would be expected to remain fairly nar-
row as a firming in the policy stance in the context of market expec-
tations of a more solid economic expansion would not be likely to
raise many concerns about credit quality. Higher yields on dollar
assets would put upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar.
M2 would grow at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate over the November-to-
March period, restrained by higher opportunity costs. M3 would expand
under alternative C at only a 3/4 percent pace over the November-to-
March period.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1994-03-22,11,"(11) Alternative C involves a larger immediate tightening
than now built into the structure of market rates. As a consequence,
money market interest rates would rise, though by much less than the
Banks would probably take this opportunity to boost the prime rate.
Long-term rates likely would also move up some. Another major bond
market sell-off cannot be ruled out, but seems less likely now. Port-
folios have been adjusted to an environment of rising short-term
interest rates; moreover, if such a decisive action were seen as
leaving the funds rate reasonably close to policy neutrality, uncer-
tainty about the magnitude and timing of future tightening actions
might be reduced.
","Alternative C"
1994-08-16,11,"(11) Alternative C embodies a move of 25 basis points. An
increase of this size, by itself, would be unlikely to have a substan-
tial effect on spending or prices, but a small tightening could lend
assurance that policy had firmed enough to keep the economy around its
potential. Although further tightening could prove to be necessary, the
Committee might judge that the case for a larger move is not yet estab-
lished. As noted above, alternative C is about what is built into the
structure of market interest rates, and neither interest nor exchange
rates are likely to react very strongly to such an action. However,
this would be the first move since the announcement in May that excess
accommodation had been substantially removed and could be seen as mark-
ing a return to the usual practice of reacting to incoming data with
small changes in reserve conditions. Markets could become somewhat more
unsettled and volatile, especially if the rise in short-term rates were
perceived as less than needed and therefore likely to be followed by
another increase but of uncertain timing.
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1994-09-27,11,"(11) The 25 basis point tightening of alternative C is con-
sistent with the current structure of market rates, and this policy
action might well trigger only muted interest rate reactions. How-
ever, since most market participants expect either no action or a 50
basis point tightening, alternative C could raise questions about
System intentions, potentially unsettling markets. A considerable
portion of the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate under
alternative D would pass through to other short-term rates. In light
of recent experience and the split in market expectations, it's dif-
ficult to say what immediate impact this alternative would have on
interest rates in capital markets. Eventually, assuming economic and
price data consistent with the staff forecast, intermediate-term
yields could tend to work their way a bit higher, as market partici-
pants raised their expected path for Federal Reserve tightening in
this phase of the business cycle. But the System's evident willing-
ness to deal with inflation pressures through a 50 basis point move
should alleviate longer-run concerns in this regard, limiting any
increases in bond yields. With the rise in real interest rates, the
dollar would likely appreciate somewhat on exchange markets.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1994-12-20,11,"(11) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate
under alternative C might be favored if the Committee viewed the
recent string of surprisingly strong economic data as clearly indicat-
ing that the risks are still tilted in the direction of sustained
faster inflation. The resulting 6 percent federal funds rate would
imply a real federal funds rate that falls more assuredly in a zone
that could be characterized as moderately restrictive. Following so
soon after the November move, a policy tightening at this meeting
would consolidate, or even extend, the gains made in reducing infla-
tion expectations in financial markets. The inclination to adopt
alternative C would be bolstered by a belief that financial markets
have largely absorbed the Orange County shock and the risks of further
disruptions are de minimus.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1995-03-28,11,"(11) With financial markets having built in no near-term
monetary policy tightening, choice of alternative C would come as a
surprise. Market participants might alter their perceptions of the
Federal Reserve's longer-term intentions and likely reactions to
future economic data. The resulting higher expected path of short-
term interest rates over the intermediate term would act to raise bond
rates, especially in real terms. But for nominal yields, the more
favorable inflation prospects for the out years, and the associated
reduction in expected short-term interest rates for those years, would
serve as a partial offset. The unexpected rise in U.S. real interest
rates across the term structure, other things equal, would provide
support for the dollar on foreign exchange markets.
","alternative C"
1995-05-23,11,"(11) With markets apparently having concluded that rates are
unlikely to rise significantly further, the response in the financial
markets to the 50 basis point increase of alternative C could be sub-
stantial. Short-term rates, including the prime rate, would likely
rise by the full amount of the increase in the federal funds rate, and
intermediate-term rates would climb considerably as well. The boost
to nominal yields on long-term Treasuries would be limited by any
reductions in premiums for expected inflation, but yield spreads on
private paper--including bank funding instruments--could widen if
market participants saw a significantly greater risk of a downturn in
business activity or if higher interest rates were seen as impairing
profit margins. Bond market volatility could be appreciable as market
participants attempted to sort out the implications of unanticipated
tightening for inflation, the strength of the expansion, and credit
risks. The dollar probably would strengthen noticeably, extending the
firming evident over the past week or so.
","alternative C"
1995-08-22,11,"(11) The drop in the federal funds rate of 1/2 percentage
point contemplated under alternative A would be much larger and sooner
than market participants currently expect. As a consequence, short-
term interest rates would fall nearly 50 basis points and banks prob-
ably would cut the prime rate 1/2 percentage point. The immediate
effect of an easing likely would be to reduce intermediate- and long-
term rates as well, especially if the Federal Reserve's perceived
optimism on inflation were to influence the market's assessment of the
outlook. Unless incoming data confirmed an improved inflation pic-
ture, however, market participants would come to question the sus-
tainability of the drop in short-term rates, and intermediate- and
long-term rates could back up. In any case, the dollar likely would
fall as System action reduced real interest rates.
","alternative A"
1995-09-26,11,"(11) Although the data received over the intermeeting period
have strengthened market participants' conviction that Federal Reserve
easing has become more likely by year-end, only a small probability of
a move at the September meeting is seen. Thus, choice by the Commit-
tee of alternative B's unchanged funds rate likely would engender just
a minor increase of short-term rates. Any immediate reaction in bond
or foreign exchange markets should be muted. Over the upcoming inter-
meeting period, economic reports consistent with the subdued growth in
the staff forecast could keep alive expectations of subsequent mone-
tary easing, allowing intermediate- and long-term interest rates to
remain near current trading ranges. The exchange value of the dollar
would be little changed. Of course, markets may be buffeted by
developments in the legislative process suggesting shifting odds on
the extent of deficit reduction.
","alternative B"
1995-11-15,11,"(11) The choice of easing under alternative A might be
favored if it were thought that some information about spending--for
example, soft industrial commodity prices and a sluggish manufacturing
sector or slowing growth of broad money and credit--was suggesting a
weakening in aggregate demand not yet evident in more general statis-
tics. These indicators might be signalling that real interest rates
already have been on the high side, and these rates could be rising
further, especially at the short end of the maturity spectrum, in
light of the recent decline in inflation and, most likely, inflation
expectations. In effect, the downward slope to the near-term yield
curve and narrow spread of the entire curve could be signalling that
real short-term rates are above those consistent with moderate growth,
especially in the face of impending fiscal restraint.
","alternative A"
1995-12-19,11,"(11) Although market participants expect monetary policy to
be eased over the next few months, a reduction of 50 basis points in
the federal funds rate implemented at this meeting, as called for
under alternative A, would be larger than generally expected. Other
short-term rates would fall appreciably, and the value of the dollar
would probably decline on foreign exchange markets. The response of
long-term yields would depend on the market's interpretation of this
action, which in turn could be influenced by the content of the
announcement. Bond rates might decline only modestly to the extent
that the action were viewed as merely realigning nominal rates to the
surprisingly damped inflation of the last half of the year. If mar-
kets thought the Committee were anticipating further moderation of
inflation, especially as a consequence of underlying weakness in
aggregate demand that implied lower real as well as nominal rates
going forward, then rate declines would be more pronounced. Such
substantial reductions in bond yields would fuel additional increases
in equity prices as investors discounted expected earnings at the
lower rates. While there is some risk that market participants would
interpret an easing as indicating insufficient regard for the longer-
term inflation outlook, this risk would be greater for a 50 basis
point cut than for a 25 basis point move. The latter is closer to
market expectations and, judging from the yield curve, would be seen
as consistent with moderate economic growth. Thus, the smaller cut is
less likely to spark major changes in market rates.
","alternative A"
1996-03-26,11,"(11) In light of the uncertainty about the current economic
situation and the widespread expectation that System policy is on
hold, it is difficult to gauge how market participants would react to
the 1/2 percentage point of policy ease envisioned under alternative
A. It is safe to say that most of the decline in the federal funds
rate would carry through to other shorter-term market rates. Market
participants might read the action, coming on the heels of 1/4 point
moves at two successive meetings, as revealing the judgment of policy
makers either that the economy could work with a thinner margin of
unused capacity without higher inflation or that aggregate demand is
weaker than most analysts are now expecting. With market participants
particularly uncertain about the economy, they might give the Commit-
tee the benefit of the doubt, at least for a while, and infer from the
policy action that the economic situation had changed. In that cir-
cumstance, intermediate- and long-term rates could fall significantly.
Alternatively, this policy easing might be seen to reflect a misread-
ing of the economic situation or evidence that the Committee was will-
ing to tolerate upside risks to inflation in the interest of stimulat-
ing growth for a time. Should this interpretation predominate, infla-
tion expectations would rise; although real interest rates probably
would fall, the prices of debt instruments could come under downward
pressure. Under all these scenarios, the foreign exchange value of
the dollar would weaken, and especially so if inflation expectations
","alternative
A"
1996-05-21,11,"(11) The case for a policy tightening at this FOMC meeting
presumably would rest on the view that the risks of higher inflation
had become substantial. Even without an assumed minimum wage in-
crease, the Committee may see the gradual upcreep in core CPI infla-
tion projected by the staff as a likely and undesirable outcome. If
the higher rate of overall inflation so far this year were feeding
through in some part to inflation expectations, a rise in the nominal
funds rate would be needed at some point to forestall an effective
easing of the policy stance. Alternative C embodies a 50 basis point
increase in the federal funds rate to 5-3/4 percent in order to
counter the incipient increase in price pressures. The Federal
Reserve is not expected by market participants to tighten for several
months, and hence, investors would be caught off guard by the FOMC's
choice of alternative C at this meeting. Short-term interest rates
would rise by 1/2 percentage point. A sense that the FOMC would be
assuming a more aggressive anti-inflationary posture than previously
anticipated, at least over the near term, might limit increases in
nominal intermediate- and long-term rates, but would lead to an
appreciable increase in real interest rates on instruments of these
maturities. The value of the dollar would probably ratchet higher on
exchange markets.
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1996-08-20,11,"(11) Given the recent adjustment to their expectations for
monetary policy, market participants would be somewhat surprised by a
Committee decision to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25
basis points, as under alternative C. Other short-term market rates
would immediately adjust upward by a like amount. Because the likely
trajectory of short-term interest rates would be higher over the in-
termediate run than previously expected by the market, some increases
in longer-term interest rates and in the exchange value of the dollar
would occur. The size of the upward adjustments would depend in part
on whether the market saw the policy firming as an isolated event or
the first of a series of policy tightenings. Some market participants
apparently sense that the Committee may require extra evidence to
change direction in monetary policy, and hence might assume that
Committee members now see the potential inflationary situation as
having worsened appreciably and may be contemplating more than one
small move. In that regard, the announcement accompanying the policy
tightening presumably could provide some guidance to the market on
these matters.
","alternative C"
1996-11-13,11,"(11) While some talk has surfaced in the market that the next
policy move might be toward ease, participants do not foresee a
reduction in the intended federal funds rate at this meeting. A 50
basis point reduction in the funds rate, as under alternative A, would
most likely be read as evidence that the Committee has serious
reservations about the prospects for spending. In this event, sizable
reductions in nominal and real market yields would likely be induced
across the term structure. However, the easing might also be taken by
the market as revealing a greater willingness on the part of the
Committee to risk an uptick in inflation as it undertook to test the
upside of potential output. If doubts about the Committee's resolve
to contain inflation were to become prevalent in the market, which
might be especially likely should incoming data indicate buoyant
spending or increased inflation pressures, nominal intermediate- and
longer-term yields could begin to reverse their initial declines. In
any case, the dollar would most likely weaken on foreign exchange
","alternative A"
1996-12-17,11,"(11) The choice of alternative C would surprise market participants and perhaps
lead them to reconsider their view on the Federal Reserve's longer-term objectives.
Real interest rates would rise, but participants might see the Federal Reserve as more
determined to reduce inflation, with beneficial effects on inflation expectations. Given
the events of the last several days, however, the market could interpret the move also
as importantly motivated by efforts to cap or even drive share prices lower. The
resulting drop in equity values would be an important channel for reducing the
excessive aggregate demand that presumably would motivate policy tightening.
","alternative C"
1997-05-20,11,"(11) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C
would come as a major surprise to financial market participants and likely would spark a
considerable rise in interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar. Future expected real
short rates could shift up appreciably over a relatively long time horizon as the market saw
the action as reflecting an FOMC view, which the market may find persuasive, that inflation
pressures over the near term were likely to be stronger than the market had previously
anticipated and an intention to contain those pressures through further aggressive policy
tightenings. The higher real interest rates for discounting future business profits, along with
possibly greater downside risks to those profits, could take a considerable toll on equity prices
as well. It is possible, though, that the market would see such a prompt substantial firming as
enough to hold inflation in check, or even reduce price pressures, without the need for any
future tightenings. In these circumstances, upward revisions to expected future interest rates
would be appreciably smaller, and the selloff at the longer end of the maturity spectrum
considerably more limited.
","alternative C"
1997-08-19,11,"(11) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, M2 is projected to
grow at a moderate 4-1/2 percent rate on average over the remaining months of the year,
around the expected rate of expansion of nominal GDP, leaving this aggregate a little below
the upper limit of its 1 to 5 percent growth range for the year. The increase in M3 is likely
to slow somewhat, as factors that have temporarily been boosting managed liabilities in that
aggregate dissipate, but M3 growth will probably continue to be fueled by a shift in institu-
tional cash management toward money market funds. This aggregate is expected to finish the
year more than a percentage point higher than its 2 to 6 percent annual range, somewhat
above the staffs projection in the July bluebook. Although the federal government will shift
to being a net borrower in credit markets over the balance of the year, the growth of its debt
will be restrained by the narrow deficit. At the same time, the level and pattern of borrowing
by private sectors is not anticipated to change significantly, producing moderate growth in the
debt of all nonfinancial sectors--near the middle of its 3 to 7 percent range and in line with
nominal GDP.

","alternative B"
1997-12-16,11,"(11) The 25 basis point tightening of Alternative C might be favored if the
Committee wanted to lean against the inflationary bias that may well be inherent in the
current and prospective tautness of labor markets. The further tightening of labor markets
this fall indicates that financial conditions prevailing over recent quarters have not been
sufficiently restrictive to hold economic growth to a sustainable pace. With real bond rates
no higher--and perhaps even a bit lower--than over the last few quarters, equity prices still
high, and monetary growth above expectations, only the rise in the dollar gives any hint of
the firmer financial conditions needed to damp strong aggregate demands. Against this
background, and with labor markets already extremely tight, the Committee might perceive
that counting on sufficient additional restraint coming from Asian developments runs an
unacceptable risk of a rebound in inflation in 1998 that would be disruptive to reverse.
","Alternative C"
1998-03-31,11,"(11) The 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative A
would translate to nearly comparable reductions in other short-term rates. In the market for
intermediate- and long-term securities, rates could decline appreciably if the easing were
viewed as confirmation that the Federal Reserve saw a pronounced slowdown resulting from
the Asian crises, making further reductions more likely. The dollar could fall on foreign
exchange markets, and lower interest rates would help the stock market hold close to its
recent record level.
","alternative A"
1998-05-19,11,"(11) The Committee instead may prefer to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25
basis points at the May meeting, as under alternative C. The Committee was concerned
about the inflation outlook at its last meeting, and in some respects that outlook may have
worsened. In particular, the unemployment rate may be seen as having now fallen so low
that, even if it were to edge up a little, as it does with the slowing of real growth in the staff
forecast, the risks of burgeoning inflationary pressures have become unacceptably high.
Although the first-quarter ECI increase was less than expected, total compensation, its wage
component, and average hourly earnings have all been on an accelerating trend for some time.
With the unemployment rate likely to remain far below any plausible estimate of its
sustainable level, nominal compensation gains may well continue to mount, in contrast to the
staff forecast. If so, expansion of labor compensation would increasingly exceed even
optimistic views of a step-up in productivity growth. Moreover, the slowdown in output
growth in the staff forecast is by no means a foregone conclusion, absent a tighter monetary
policy stance. The effects of Asian woes on net exports may not of themselves be a
sufficient offset to buoyant domestic final demand at current levels of short-term interest
rates. Although real interest rates are high relative to historical norms, medium- and long-
term real rates still may not be elevated enough at present to exert adequate restraint on
spending for consumer durables, housing, and business fixed investment in light of optimistic
""animal spirits"" and rising equity prices. Even if the Committee were not dissatisfied with
the likely intermediate-term economic outlook, it might see the possibility that an equity price
bubble was building as representing a sufficient threat in the more distant future to the health
of the economy and the financial system to warrant consideration of tightening policy. The
appendix provides additional perspective on the potential role of equity prices in monetary
policy decisions.
","alternative C"
1998-09-29,11,"(11) With markets betting heavily on an easing at this FOMC meeting, holding rates
unchanged as in alternative B would leave investors confused about Federal Reserve intentions
and likely engender added volatility. Short-term Treasury and private rates would back up
sharply, and longer-term rates also would rise, though perhaps not by much if, as seems likely,
market participants believed that the easing had merely been postponed. Increases in Treasury
yields might be less than in private rates, if adverse reactions in financial markets strengthened
flight-to-safety motives. A part of the recent improvement in foreign financial markets, which
has been built on growing expectations of an easing in U.S. monetary policy, could be reversed,
particularly in some especially vulnerable countries. The foreign exchange value of the dollar
would likely rise, although this effect could be mitigated somewhat if the adverse effects on Latin
American markets were particularly severe.
","alternative B"
1998-11-17,11,"(11) With many market participants likely to be disappointed by policy inaction, yields
on private securities could well back up some under alternative B. The increase in rates on
Treasury securities likely would be somewhat less, and spreads on private securities over
Treasuries probably would widen. Although the initial effects of this alternative on financial
markets could be somewhat negative, they would be muted and short-lived to the extent that the
public believes the Federal Reserve is staying especially watchful of financial market strains and
has not closed the door on further policy easing. While some risk of unusual year-end pressures
cannot be ruled out, chances are that any curtailment of liquidity and trading volumes across a
variety of markets would prove limited and essentially temporary. Equity prices likely would
decline somewhat. The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets should firm, and credit
spreads for emerging market securities might rise.
","alternative B"
1998-12-22,11,"(11) Against this backdrop, the choice of alternative B should have little effect on
domestic interest rates or dollar exchange rates. After year-end, when trading volume picks up
and investors again become more willing to put weaker credits on their balance sheets, conditions
in securities markets may well become more liquid, and risk spreads could well narrow. Still,
difficulties in foreign financial markets, domestic market disruptions, high volatility, and unusual
patterns of asset price movements of recent months are likely to leave a lasting imprint on
perceptions of risk, the appetite for it, and the resources dedicated to taking positions in financial
markets. As a consequence, spreads in many markets should remain appreciably above their
levels of last summer and liquidity somewhat reduced.
","alternative B"
1999-05-18,11,"(11) Financial market prices embody little expectation of a policy firming at this
meeting. As a consequence, the immediate 25 basis point increase in the funds rate of
alternative C would trigger a similar rise in short-term interest rates. The extent of the
response of other U.S. financial markets would depend on the outlook for further policy
firming, which would be importantly affected by the wording of the announcement. Longer-
term rates should go up significantly less than short rates, as some later rise in short-term
nominal rates already has been built into market prices, and investors might be more
confident of the outlook for subdued inflation with such a preemptive move by the Federal
Reserve. However, if market participants were to decide that several additional tightening
moves were likely, long rates would increase more substantially, as they often have in the past
when policy has turned in a firming direction. Some adverse reaction would be expected in
foreign financial markets, but absent a steep sell-off in domestic markets, the fallout should
be limited, given the recovery in overseas markets and their modest response to the recent
increases in U.S. interest rates.
","alternative C"
1999-08-24,11,"(11) Given the high odds market participants put on action at this meeting, the
announcement that the Committee was raising the intended federal funds rate 1/4
percentage point, as under alternative C, should produce little response in key financial
prices if no surprises are in store from the wording of the press release. The market
consensus has settled on a quarter-point move and the retention of a symmetric directive. If
the announcement of such a directive suggested to market participants that further action
was unlikely for some time, financial markets might rally to some extent, as investors
removed the modest odds on additional tightening that now seem built into the structure of
interest rates for the fourth quarter. If, instead, action on Tuesday were accompanied by a
directive tilted toward tightening, market participants could take it as a signal that additional
firming is in the cards this year--and more so even than is currently built into financial
prices. As a result, the term structure of interest rates would likely shift up and the dollar
would probably strengthen on exchange markets. Because additional tightening would be
taken as fairly imminent, market spreads would likely remain wide as issuers rushed to lock
in longer-term financing in advance of the Committee's next action. Indeed, if the
Committee thought that it likely would need to tighten again before year-end because it
wanted to forestall an upward trend to inflation like that in the staff forecast, century-date-
change considerations might strengthen the argument for a 50 basis point firming with a
symmetric directive at this meeting instead of a 25 basis point move with an asymmetric
directive. Such a move, by restoring the federal funds rate to its level of last August and by
getting ahead of market expectations, would have a very good chance of being seen as the
last action for the year. While interest rates and the dollar's exchange rate would rise
appreciably and equity prices likely would fall, helping to damp demand more than in the
staff forecast, the elements of volatility and uncertainty in the market associated with
possible near-term policy action would be greatly diminished. After the initial adjustment,
market conditions should settle down, providing a better environment for financial market
participants to plan their balance sheet management over the year-end.
","alternative C"
1999-11-16,11,"(11) The Committee instead may favor a 25 basis point increase in its intended
federal funds rate, as under alternative C. Although the staff has adopted the view that
structural productivity is growing along a higher and steeper trajectory over the forecast
period than previously thought, it still predicts an increase in core inflation over the next
two years that the Committee may find both likely and unacceptable. The Committee may
view the current tautness in labor markets as pointing so strongly toward a pickup in
inflation that the need to firm policy would be unlikely to be called into question by new
information arriving over the next few months. Even if the Committee questioned whether
current labor market conditions were so problematic, it may still see a substantial risk that
resource utilization is in the process of tightening further, which in turn would induce rising
inflation. The growth of aggregate demand has continued to outstrip that of aggregate
supply, and only limited data are in hand to indicate that demand will be slowing enough to
bring the two into balance. Indeed, one risk to that balancing is that policy inaction would
provide additional fuel to investor optimism, pushing equity prices higher and providing a
spur to spending. Another risk may emanate from the external sector: Recent news on
foreign economies has been upbeat and has contributed to better conditions in their capital
markets, which may provide more impetus to spending than projected by the staff. The
inflationary impulse from the external sector would be intensified if improving foreign
growth prospects and mounting U.S. net foreign indebtedness were to diminish the appetite
of global investors for dollar assets, placing substantial downward pressure on the dollar,
which would directly feed through to prices as well as demand for U.S. output. To offset
these external forces, firmer financial conditions in the United States would be necessary to
damp domestic demand so as to prevent an intensification of pressures on resources.
","alternative C"
1999-12-21,11,"(11) As noted, considerations relating to the century date change would seem to
militate against tightening at this meeting. Nonetheless, the Committee might wish to
contemplate the 25 basis point tightening of policy at this meeting under alternative C--
perhaps as background for selection of an asymmetric directive or even for consideration of
an intermeeting move once risks associated with the century date change have faded. In the
staff forecast, core inflation picks up--and is poised to move higher beyond the projection
horizon--even with 75 basis points of further tightening and the more rapid rates of
productivity growth that the staff has built into the forecast over recent months. In effect,
faster productivity growth, other things equal, needs to be reflected at some point in higher
real interest rates to keep the influences of the associated boost to earnings--working on the
demands for capital goods and, through wealth, on consumption--from driving aggregate
demand further beyond aggregate supply. Still higher interest rates would be needed to
bring the levels of demand and supply into balance so as to forestall rising inflation. Indeed,
based on incoming spending data and the continued upward march of equity prices, the
Committee may see the risks to aggregate demand as having shifted further to the upside
over recent months, possibly requiring more restrictive financial conditions than assumed in
the staff forecast just to keep the output gap from widening. A firming action at this
meeting or in mid-January would be only a little prompter than in the staff forecast. But it is
likely to be associated with a sharper rise in market interest rates as market participants
inferred from the timing of the action that the Federal Reserve was much more concerned
about near-term inflation risks than they had perceived and was on a steeper tightening path
than now incorporated in the yield curve. As noted above, a tightening at this meeting
would pose some risk of prompting financial market disruptions.
","alternative C"
2000-12-19,11,"(11) If the Committee thinks that output growth is likely to slow appreciably
more than envisioned in the staff forecast, then it might choose the 25 basis point
easing of alternative A. Such an assessment of growth prospects might reflect
concern that the reduced pace of economic expansion, additional financial difficulties,
and weaker earnings growth could be in the process of eroding consumer and
business sentiment and tightening financial conditions more than in the Greenbook.
In this circumstance, a prompt easing of policy, by bolstering asset values and
confidence, might help short-circuit this interactive process. Easier policy also might
be in order if the Committee believes output growth along the lines of the staff
forecast is likely, but reads the evidence as suggesting a considerably higher sustainable
level of output, and hence a correspondingly lower NAIRU, than estimated by the
staff. Under these circumstances, even if the Committee thinks that some reduction
in the level of demand on productive resources is appropriate, it might want to ease
policy slightly now given both the lags with which changes in policy influence the
economy and the substantial rise in the unemployment rate projected by the staff.
","alternative A"
2004-05-04,11,"(11) If Committee members were sufficiently confident that the expansion
was now self-sustaining or saw the recent increase in core inflation as signaling an
upturn in underlying inflation, then they might find an increase of ¼ percentage point
in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in Alternative C, to be appropriate.  The
Committee may view the advances in investment outlays, coupled with the more
recent evidence that hiring is picking up, as suggesting that the tentativeness that had
earlier marked business behavior has lifted.  Indeed, as increased hiring buoys incomes
and consumer confidence, the resulting growth in spending may support faster gains
in investment spending and employment than expected by the staff, implying a swifter
erosion of resource slack.  Members may also be less confident than the staff that
aggregate supply will continue to expand at a rapid pace and that the recent increases
in energy and non-oil import prices will leave only a small imprint on inflation
expectations.  If so, the Committee, like financial market participants, may see a
significant risk that inflation could move higher, suggesting that the time has come to
adjust policy.  Indeed, if the Committee believes that expected inflation may rise, then
it might see an increase in the target funds rate as necessary just to avoid a reduction
in the real federal funds rate and a consequent easing of policy relative to measures of
the equilibrium funds rate (Chart 5).  The argument for tighter policy would be
strengthened to the extent that the Committee wants to keep inflation near its recent
lows over the longer term, rather than allowing some increase.  While policy
tightening might put some strains on financial markets for a time, Committee
members might not be convinced that the elevated uncertainty and financial market
turbulence of 1994-95 is as relevant a precedent as some observers assert, in part
because investors seem to expect that significant tightening will commence soon (see
box on Lessons From the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle).

Lessons from the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle
The current policy environment is similar in some respects to that prevailing before the
policy tightening in 1994-95.  In both cases, an initially sluggish expansion in
employment was accompanied by a real federal funds rate that fell to near zero for a
time.  The nominal federal funds rate target, shown in the left panel on the next page, is
currently 2 percentage points lower than at the start of 1994, reflecting in part the net
decline in inflation over the intervening ten years.  The policy tightening that began in
February 1994 sparked a period of financial market turbulence that caused serious
difficulties for some financial institutions.  This adverse outcome has raised concerns
about whether similar volatility could follow a move to tighter policy this year.
The seemingly outsized market reaction to the 1994-95 tightening reflected several
factors.  First, many market participants had not fully expected a policy tightening at that
time and so were poorly positioned.  Second, investors considerably underestimated the
ultimate extent of tightening, though part of that forecast error reflected the surprising
strength of the economy after the tightening process had begun.  (The staff was
surprised as well, and the Greenbook forecast of the unemployment rate in the fourth
quarter of 1994 fell about ¾ percentage point over the course of that year.)  Third,
uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was high, particularly
early in the tightening cycle.  Investors reacted to the changed economic and policy
outlook by selling long-term securities to limit capital losses and hedge the lengthening
durations of mortgage portfolios that resulted from higher interest rates.  These portfolio
adjustments at times took place over short periods of time, leading to volatile moves in
long-term rates.  As shown in the right panel, long-term yields increased almost as much
as short-term rates early in the tightening cycle.
To be sure, the historical record does suggest that changes in the direction of the policy
rate tend to elicit a stronger market response than actions extending the existing trend in
the policy rate.  And the turbulence in financial markets last summer and fall may suggest
that hedging flows will magnify the amplitude of any swings in longer-term interest rates. 
As a result, some firms with large interest rate exposures could face substantial losses
when interest rates rise.  That said, there are some signs that financial firms and markets
may be able to handle policy tightening better than they did in 1994.  Although the
expected policy path is not as steep now as the actual tightening that took place ten years
ago, it is nonetheless considerably steeper than that foreseen immediately before the first
tightening in 1994.  Even if interest rates do respond strongly to a move toward tighter
policy, financial institutions appear better positioned to withstand the impact owing to
improved risk-management practices.  And, although the size of the mortgage market is
now much larger, the recent run-up in interest rates has reduced prepayment rates
enough to moderate the extent to which any further increase in rates will induce hedging
flows.
Lessons from the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle (Continued)
","Alternative C"
2004-06-29,11,"(11) Chart 6 displays results under alternative assumptions about the inflation
objective, with 1½ percent serving as the benchmark.  Under an objective of
1 percent, the optimal policy implies a more rapid increase in the funds rate; by mid-
2005, the funds rate exceeds the optimum path for the benchmark case by about
75 basis points.  Because households and firms (unlike investors) only gradually revise
their beliefs about long-run policy objectives, rapid disinflation would require an
immediate and sizable opening of an output gap.  The optimal policy avoids such an
extreme and instead pursues a gradual decline in inflation and a small and persistent
rise in unemployment.5  With an inflation objective of 2 percent, the optimal
tightening in policy this year and next is attenuated.  The nominal funds rate
eventually exceeds that of the baseline, but the real funds rate remains lowerand a
bit below its equilibrium valuethrough 2010, fostering a gradual pickup in inflation. 
The unemployment rate declines somewhat more quickly than in the benchmark case
and then remains below the NAIRU throughout the remainder of the decade.  
Short-Run Policy Alternatives
","alternative a"
2004-09-21,11,"(11) While the Committee may be convinced that a sustainable economic
expansion is in place, it may be concerned that the pace of output growth will not be
sufficiently vigorous to make satisfactory progress in reducing economic slack.  In the
Greenbook forecast, for instance, resource slack persists for much of the next two
years and core inflation drifts lower.  If the Committee finds this to be undesirable, it
may consider leaving the funds rate target unchanged at this meeting, as in
Alternative A.  The resulting easing of financial conditions would presumably better
ensure satisfactory growth in aggregate demand.  A relatively slow pace of firming may
be warranted by concerns that aggregate demand growth could be restrained in
coming quarters by a number of factors, including efforts on the part of households
to raise their saving rates and the drag of the widening trade deficit, and especially so
if such factors develop more quickly or forcefully than in the Greenbook outlook.  In
addition, in the staff forecast, persisting slack and lower energy and import prices
impart a slight downtrend to core inflation that could bring it to levels that the
Committee might find uncomfortably low, given the limits to conventional policy
maneuvering posed by the zero bound to nominal interest rates.  The measured
pace language would not seem to be an obstacle to pausing the process of firming, in
that futures rates indicate that financial market participants already anticipate inaction
at one of the next three meetingsalthough apparently not this one.  Indeed, a pause
at this time might be seen as having the benefit of ensuring that market participants
do not come inappropriately to view the measured pace language as a promise to
firm policy at every meeting.
","Alternative A"

gauge precisely.  Futures quotes indicate that market prices have largely, but not
completely, built in a quarter-point tightening at Wednesdays meeting, suggesting that
such an action would probably impart a bit of upward pressure to near-term yields.  In
addition, options data indicate that investors attach some probability to scenarios in
which the funds rate remains at 2 percent for a few meetings.  Nonetheless, the signal
of a possible pause might cause investors to mark down the odds they currently seem

New Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate
This Bluebook introduces new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  
The new estimates were developed to address shortcomings of the earlier measures 
that, as reported in the Bluebook Readership Survey, made them difficult to interpret.1  
One problem with the earlier measures was that the concept underlying the measures 
was not defined clearly.  For example, the time horizonthe period over which the 
output gap would be projected to close if the real funds rate were kept at its 
equilibrium leveldiffered across measures and was not clearly specified.  Second, the 
chart summarizing the various measures may have given a misleading picture of the 
uncertainty surrounding the point estimates.  Finally, the two-sided estimates that 
were included would seem to be inappropriate for real-time policymaking.
The new chart reports two kinds of equilibrium rate measures, differing in terms 
of their time horizon.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined to be the rate that, if 
sustained, would be projected to close the output gap in twelve quarters.  The 
medium-run measure is defined to be the rate projected to prevail in seven years 
under the assumption that monetary policy will act to eliminate economic slack in 
three years and to hold output at potential thereafter.  The new estimates are 
calculated based on three different models: a single-equation model of the output gap, 
a small structural model consisting of equations for five key macroeconomic variables, 
and the staffs large-scale model (FRB/US).  In addition to the range encompassing 
the point estimates of the three models, the chart also displays confidence bands that 
illustrate the uncertainties surrounding the range of model estimates.  Also shown are 
the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium ratewhich is based 
on a version of the FRB/US model that has been adjusted to match the Greenbook 
forecastand the medium-run equilibrium rate consistent with TIPS yields.
The new model-based estimates shown in this Bluebook suggest a higher current 
level for the equilibrium real federal funds rate than did the range based on the old 
methods that was included in the November Bluebook.  This difference occurs mainly 
because we have dropped the measures based on the statistical-filter model, which 
exhibited implausibly large responses to surprises in output.  The Greenbook-
consistent measure currently yields an equilibrium rate lower than model-based 
estimates because the Greenbook projects that the recent weakness in aggregate 
demand will diminish more gradually than the models predict.
It should be noted that the appropriate stance of policy relative to the equilibrium 
estimates in a given instance will depend on policymakers objectives and the 
projected paths for output and inflation.  Thus, these estimates of the equilibrium rate 
should not be interpreted as policy prescriptions, but rather as potential inputs to the 
policy process.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would
be anticipated to close the output gap in twelve quarters, and the medium-run concept is the value of
the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that
monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them
equal thereafter.  With the exception of the TIPS-consistent measure, the real federal funds rates
employ the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for
expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.  TIPS indexation is based on
the total CPI.
Measure Description
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap
and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light
of this models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate
depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run
measure is virtually constant.
Small Structural
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the
output gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of
output, and the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model,
values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with
output growth, fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large M odel
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US the staffs large-scale econometric
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the
output gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed
because it requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real
forward rate derived from TIPS yields reflects the short-term real interest rate expected
to prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium.  The term premium is

probably have scope to absorb some increase in costs by reducing profit margins.  A
quarter-point firming at this meeting presumably to be followed by further increases
over time could be seen as sufficient to cut off the inflation pressures already in the
pipeline, especially so if the Committee harbors doubts about the continued vigor of
the expansion given the sharp rise in oil prices and the backup in long-term rates.
","Alternative B"
2005-06-29,11,"(11) At first glance, an apparently unattractive implication of the preceding
simulations is that policymakers pursuit of their inflation objective appears to be
rather tepid, with actual inflation still differing noticeably from the goal at the end of
policymakers place equal weights on stabilizing unemployment and inflation.  Because
the model implies that inflation is quite insensitive to the level of economic activity
and long-term inflation expectations of households and firms evolve slowly in
response to realized inflation, policymakers do not find it worthwhile to create
sufficient resource slack to make more rapid progress in achieving the inflation goal.
The simulations shown in Chart 6 consider two potential mechanisms within this
modeling framework that could hasten the attainment of a long-run goal of 1½
percent core PCE inflation. First, a stronger focus on inflation can be represented by
ratcheting down the relative weight on unemployment deviations; in this case, the
optimal path of policy (as indicated by the dashed lines) is significantly tighter than in
the benchmark case with equal weights on unemployment and inflation (the solid
lines).6  Second, the long-term inflation expectations of households and firms might
move lower, perhaps encouraged by the adoption of an explicit long-run inflation
objective; 7 under this assumption, the optimal path of the funds rate only rises
modestly over the next few quarters to a plateau of about 3½ percent.  While both
approaches succeed in bringing inflation close to the Committees assumed goal
within the next few years, the model indicates that the unemployment costs are
substantially smaller when this outcome is achieved through less inertial inflation

while the hurricane will have adverse short-run economic consequences, including
heightened uncertainty and market volatility, the longer-run prospects for the

other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures, but would also indicate
that . . . core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term

monetary policy accommodation and robust underlying growth in productivity
continued to support economic activity.  The rest of the statement would repeat the
measured pace language and the assessment that, with appropriate monetary policy
action, the risks to growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.

2005-11-01,11,"(11) The Committee may wish to begin the rationale portion of the statement
for Alternative B by reaffirming the view that adverse effects of the hurricanes will
probably slow the pace of the expansion only temporarily.  Robust underlying growth
in productivity may still be seen as a support for economic activity.  The statement
could also note the boost to aggregate demand from increased private and public
spending associated with rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas.  While a
range of estimated equilibrium rates, the Committee may still prefer to characterize
policy as accommodative in light of the underlying strength of demand and upward
pressures on inflation.  As for inflation, the Committee could cite indications, evident
in some producer prices and in surveys of near-term inflation expectations, that The
cumulative rise in energy and other costs has added to inflation pressures, while still
noting that core inflation has been relatively low in recent months.  The
observation that longer-term inflation expectations remain contained may be seen
as appropriate to convey a balanced view of the inflation outlook.

","Alternative B"
2005-12-13,11,"(11) The Committee may favor the statement language of Alternative B if it
thinks that somewhat higher federal funds rates are likely to prove necessary to limit
pressures on resources and promote price stability but also believes that this
tightening phase could be ending fairly soon.  The resilience of the economy in the
face of hurricane-related disruptions, already limited margins of slack in resource
markets, and the pressures on inflation from elevated energy prices may incline the
Committee to believe that additional firming will probably be necessary even after a
policy accommodation now significantly reduced, the appropriate timing and extent
of additional policy firming are becoming more uncertain.  Declines in energy prices
and inflation expectations from their recent peaks may have eased members concerns
about the inflation outlook.  And the real federal funds rate (as measured using lagged
inflation to proxy for inflation expectations) is now within the range of staff estimates
of its equilibrium value (Chart 5).  Moreover, with a 25 basis point tightening at this
meeting, the federal funds rate would be above the range of prescriptions from policy
rules based on a target for inflation of 1½ percent (Chart 6), and one more tightening
would bring the rate to the top of the range that the rules would call for even in the
second half of next year.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding models projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.
Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

last year.  The discussion of inflation risks in Alternative B is similar to that employed
in the last statement, but goes into a little more detail.  It is cautiously optimistic in its
assessment of inflation pressures:  Inflation expectations remain contained, the pass-
through of cost pressures has been limited, and productivity gains have kept unit
labor costs in check.  The statement nonetheless acknowledges that elevated prices of
energy and other commodities and increases in resource utilization have the potential
to add to inflationary pressures in the future.  The reference to possible increases in
resource utilization employed in the last two announcements is changed to
increases in resource utilization, in response to the robust spending and labor
market data received over the intermeeting period.  The retention from the January
statement of the indication that some further policy firming may be needed to keep
the risks to the Committees objectives balanced provides the Committee with
considerable flexibility regarding subsequent policy decisions.  However, if members
wanted to signal that the end of the tightening cycle was likely very close, then they

For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staffs estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (t), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead (t+2|t and t+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
( *t ty y ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap ( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ + ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +   ), and the assumed value

Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarters prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Except for backward-looking rules, it should be noted that prescriptions near the end of the Greenbook 
horizon also depend on extended baselines. 
 
  
 
Estimated Rules:  Estimation is performed using real-time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4, and the

might be viewed as appropriate by the Committee if it saw high energy and other
commodity prices and high levels of resource utilization as implying that the upside
risks to inflation remain substantial.  Moreover, recent data on labor compensation
and productivity, while not fully congruent with other indicators of labor costs, may
also be seen as pointing to potentially substantial inflation risks, as in the greater
wage pressure scenario presented in the Greenbook.
","Alternative B"
2006-12-12,11,"(11) If the Committee views a combination of near-trend growth and a gradual
ebbing of core inflation over the next two years as the best attainable outcome in
current circumstances and continues to judge that the current stance of policy is
broadly consistent with achieving such an outcome, it might be attracted to
Alternative B.  With the real federal funds rate at the upper end of the range of
model-based estimates of its equilibrium value and a bit above the Greenbook-
consistent measure, policy might be viewed as applying slight restraint on economic
activity, helping to foster a reduction of inflation.  Some tentative signs suggest that
core inflation may be starting to moderate, and incoming data suggest that near-term
economic expansion may be a bit further below growth of potential output than had
previously been anticipated.  Even so, the possibility that inflation might not slow as
expected may remain the dominant concern for policy going forward.  The substantial
uncertainty regarding the dynamics of inflation implies a risk that recent rates of
inflation might persist even if output grows at only a moderate pace and energy prices
are broadly unchanged.  Moreover, the current tightness of the labor market
evidenced both by the low unemployment rate in October and by widespread reports

to the Committees desired moderation in inflation.  Even if the likelihood of a
deterioration in inflation performance relative to expectations is not thought to be
significantly greater than that of a corresponding deterioration in economic growth,
the Committee might judge that an erosion in inflation outcomes would be more
costly and thus view the upside risks to inflation as the greater concern for policy.

unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and avoiding changes in the nominal
funds rate.4  In principle, because the decisions of the private sector depend in part
on expectations regarding the future path of policy, and because policymakers are
assumed to place somewhat greater weight on near-term outcomes relative to those
at distant horizons, a policymaker might be tempted to reoptimize the path of policy
at a later date, even in the absence of any new information.  However, given the
structure of the FRB/US model, the magnitude of those readjustments in current
circumstances would be very small (see box on Dynamic Inconsistency and Optimal
Control Policies).  For an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts),
the optimal path of the nominal federal funds rate is somewhat higher than that
presented in the October and December Bluebooks, remaining close to 5¼ percent
over the next two years and then gradually declining to about 4 percent by the end
of 2012.  With a lower near-term outlook for core inflation, this path for the nominal
rate implies a somewhat higher real interest rate, which tempers the increased strength
of aggregate demand.  Output remains close to its potential; the unemployment rate
returns to the NAIRU by the end of next year and remains near that rate in
subsequent years.  However, the cumulative decline in energy prices helps nudge
inflation lower, and core inflation settles around its 2 percent goal without the need
for any substantial economic slack.  By contrast, with an inflation goal of 1½ percent
(left-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate peaks at just above 6 percent in early
about 3½ percent by 2012.  Furthermore, it is evident from this scenario that the
latest revision to the staffs outlook has not significantly affected the medium-term
policy tradeoff:  The optimal policy generates outcomes in 2012 for both

Dynamic Inconsistency and Optimal Control Policies 
 
The optimal control policies shown in the Bluebook assume that the policymaker specifies  
a particular funds rate path starting from that date and then follows that path.  In principle,  
a policymaker might be tempted to reoptimize the path of policy at some later date, even in  
the absence of new information; that is, the prescriptions from these simulations might exhibit 
dynamic inconsistency.  The academic literature has emphasized two possible sources of this temptation.  
First, policymakers might desire to keep the unemployment rate below its sustainable rate and hence 
be inclined towards inflation surprises; however, because such surprises cannot be systematic if the 
private sectors expectations are rationally determined, this inclination toward stimulative policies 
only raises inflation.  Second, if current decisions of the private sector depend on expected future 
monetary policy actions and if policymakers discount the future, then the central bank may be 
tempted to view private-sector expectations of future policy actions as a separate instrument from 
actual actions.  In the optimal control scenarios shown in the Bluebook, the first source of dynamic 
inconsistency does not arise because, along with other goals, policymakers are always assumed to 
have the objective of keeping unemployment close to its natural rate.  However, the second source 
could be relevant for the optimal control simulations that have become a staple of the Bluebook. 
  
The magnitude of this dynamic inconsistency can be gauged, for example, by considering the 
optimal control scenario shown in the left column of Chart 6, in which the policymaker has an 
inflation goal of 1½ percent.  As shown in the chart below, in the absence of any new information, 
reoptimizing the policy path in either 2009 (the dashed line) or 2010 (the dash-dotted line) yields 
funds rate prescriptions that differ by less than ¼ percentage point from those of the optimal policy 
in the benchmark scenario (the solid line).  Additional simulations (not shown) indicate that the 
small magnitude of these deviations is robust to alternative values of the policymakers discount rate 
and to the relative weight placed on the objective of avoiding interest rate changes.

The small magnitude of dynamic inconsistency provides some reassurance that the optimal control 
simulations shown in each Bluebook can serve as useful benchmarks in assessing medium-term 
policy strategies.  Of course, this issue might well loom larger under different macroeconomic 
circumstances or under alternative assumptions about policymaker preferences and private-sector 
expectations formation.1

1970-05-26,12,"(12) Should the Committee--for example, because it wishes
to accommodate what appears to be increased liquidity demands in the
economy--wish to move onto a path that allows for somewhat greater
rates of growth in the monetary aggregates than Alternative A, the
following language for the second paragraph might be considered:
To implement this policy, the Committee desires to

MARKET CONDITIONS.
","Alternative A"
1971-01-12,12,"(12) With the forthcoming Treasury refunding probably largely
discounted by the market, with recent corporate issues well received, and
in light of the still large spread of long- over short-term rates, it
seems likely that longer-term interest rates will drop further, except
under conditions specified for alternative A. Interest rate declines
would tend to accelerate should the Federal funds rate move down
significantly from prevailing levels.
","alternative A"
1971-02-09,12,"(12) The rate of inflow of time deposits other than large
CD's is expected to slacken later in February and March, following the
unusually rapid growth of the previous two months. A number of banks
have adjusted downward interest rates offered on consumer-type time and
savings accounts. This tendency is likely to become more widespread,
especially under alternative A, and may serve, along with an increase of
consumer spending as projected in the Green Book, to moderate savings
inflows. However, given the very rapid growth in time and savings deposits
other than large CD's that has already occurred and taking account of the
expected increase in M1, the rate of growth in M2 (M1 plus time and savings
deposits other than large CD's) is expected to be a very sizable 16-1/2
per cent annual rate in the first quarter. Under alternative B, the rate
of growth in M2 would be expected to be only slightly less rapid than
under alternative A. These estimates of M2 behavior in the future are
highly problematical because of uncertainties about the timing and extent
of bank cuts in offering rates on consumer-type accounts and the effect
of this on savers in a period of declining market interest rates.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1971-04-06,12,"(12) Long-term markets are likely to remain sensitive to money
market conditions as indicators of Federal Reserve policy. Thus, attain-
ment of the conditions specified in alternative A would be likely to re-
inforce other trends in capital markets now expected to contribute to
some further decline in long-term rates, as noted in the Greenbook. On
the other hand, if money market conditions are made firmer, as specified
under alternatives B and C, shifts in market expectations about the course
of short-term rates and monetary policy might tend to offset the under-
lying trends. A rise in long-term rates would seem likely if the Federal
funds rate were to trend convincingly above 4 per cent, with the rise in
long rates largest if money market conditions were to tighten as much as
specified under alternative C.
Possible directive language
","alternative A, alternative C"
1971-06-08,12,"(12) Alternative B, which indicates a somewhat more gradual
deceleration of the aggregates than alternative C, is less likely to lead
to sharp and sustained upward interest rate adjustments and hence to the
need for a later easing in money market conditions. However, over the near-
term a funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent, as specified in alternative B, would
likely induce a renewed increase in long-term interest rates, particularly as
expectations of a discount rate increase became more prevalent and another
rise in the prime rate more likely. But the general interest rate increase
would not carry as far as under alternative C and there would be a greater
probability of a corrective market rally later on.
","Alternative B, alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1971-07-27,12,"(12) While there are reasons to expect slower growth in M1 , it
is difficult to pinpoint the timing. Experience makes it clear that interest
rates affect money demand with a lag, but the exact timing of this effect
is uncertain. Moreover, shifts in demand for financial assets, given interest
rates, are notoriously hard to predict, since they depend to a great extent
on the mysterious elements that work on consumer and investor confidence.
At the present time, the staff expects M1 growth to average a little over
cent growth rate for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we would
expect a drop in the growth rate to around 4 per cent, despite the increase
in purely transactions balances required to finance the accelerated growth
in nominal GNP expected in the fall. Under alternative B, growth is expected
to be only about 1/2 percentage point lower than under alternative A in the
third quarter, but about 1-1/2 percentage points lower in the fourth quarter.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1971-09-21,12,"(12) Growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's
is expected to accelerate from recent low rates to about a 9-1/2 per cent
annual rate in September, given experience in the first two weeks of the
month, but, under alternative A, to drop back to a 7-1/2 per cent rate in
the fourth quarter. The lower growth rate is anticipated in view of
strengthened consumer spending and the liklihood that market interest
rates will not drop enough to provide much in the way of incentive for
savers to add sharply to time deposit funds. A somewhat more rapid growth
in such deposits would be anticipated under alternative C, given the marked
decline in market interest rates that would be expected.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1971-10-19,12,"(12) A fairly sizable expansion in bank CD's is anticipated
between now and year-end, although the growth rate is likely to be less
than the exceptional September pace. Somewhat stronger business loan
demands, assuming GNP growth as projected in the Greenbook, and a will-
ingness to acquire securities in anticipation of declining long-term
market interest rates are expected to encourage banks to issue CD's.
It is likely, though, that banks will lower CD offering rates if short-
term market rates decline, but not so rapidly as to forestall a somewhat
greater increase in CD's in November under alternatives B and C than
under alternative A, with the additional funds used to build up positions
in securities.
Possible directive language
","alternative A"
1971-11-16,12,"(12) The narrow money supply (M1) under alternative A/B is
expected to show only a slight decline in November at a one per cent
annual rate, but to resume growth beginning in December. On the basis

of past relationships, the depressant effect on money demand of the
high short-term interest rates of late spring and summer should have
about run its course. Prospects for a reduced rate of inflation in-
duced by the new economic program have probably also encouraged money
holders to reduce cash balances relative to income, offsetting the
large build-up of spring and early summer. With these two types of
adjustments largely completed, it appears that money supply should
soon begin rising more in line with the transactions demands implicit
in the staff's GNP forecast, which indicates about a 9 per cent rate of
rise on average in nominal GNP in the fourth and first quarters. M 1
is expected to grow at only a 1-1/2 per cent annual rate from November
to December, but to be followed by a 6 per cent growth rate in the first
quarter. The lower interest rates and greater reserve supply under
alternative C would likely lead to a more rapid 3 per cent rate of growth
in December, followed by an 8 per cent expansion in the first quarter.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1971-12-14,12,"(12) With M1 strengthening in recent weeks relative to earlier
expectations, it now appears as if the December average level of the money
supply will be about 4-1/2 per cent above November, given the money market
conditions of either A or B. Money growth would be slightly less under A
than B, but after rounding the difference in rates of growth and levels does
not show up until January. Under alternative C the growth rate in December
might be about 5 per cent.
","alternative C"
1972-02-15,12,"(12) This section presents two alternative formulations for the
second paragraph of the directive (labeled ""A"" and ""B"") which are intended
to be--though they do not necessarily have to be--associated with differing
degrees of emphasis in operating procedures between money market conditions
and reserves. Each of the two formulations shows three alternative adjec-
tives qualifying ""growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.""
These adjectives can be taken, if the Committee so wishes, to represent
alternative target rates of growth. To provide a possible quantitative
interpretation of these adjectives, they are numbered I, II, and III to
correspond with the three aggregate patterns described in the preceding
","alternative a"
1972-05-23,12,"(12) Inflows to banks of time deposits other than large CD's
are expected to moderate over the months ahead from their rather rapid
May pace. Moderation should be most noticeable after mid-year, though,
when short-term market interest rates are most likely to be rising signif-
icantly. Under alternative A, we would expect the rate of growth in such
deposits in the third quarter to drop to around 9 per cent, somewhat below
the expected second quarter pace, and about half the first quarter rate.
Under alternatives B and C, the rate of growth would likely be substantially
smaller. This would be particularly so under the money market conditions
expected to be consistent with alternative C aggregates. Short-term market
rates in the third quarter under those circumstances are likely to be above
most current ceiling rates on consumer-type time deposits.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1972-08-15,12,"(12) Under all three of the alternatives, short-term rates are
likely to be moving upward in the fourth quarter under pressure from rising
credit demands. Some of this pressure will come from business demands on
banks and the commercial paper market, but the major factor will be the
heavy anticipated Federal cash borrowing--which will undoubtedly be mainly
in short-term markets. (The period of heavy Treasury borrowing will not come
until October, but some financing may be needed in September, possibly close
to the time when the System will also be selling Treasury issues to absorb
the excess reserves released by the combined effects of changes in Regulation D
and J.) Even under alternative A, although little change would be anticipated
in the Federal funds rate, the 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise from
its recently depressed rate by 50 basis points or so during the fourth quarter,
and very likely will advance further in early 1973. Upward pressure on
short-term rates, of course, would be considerably greater under alternative B--
and more so under C. Thus, the 3-month bill rate might rise to 5 per cent
or more by the end of the fourth quarter under B and could be approaching
","alternative A, alternative B"
1972-09-19,12,"(12) Under alternative A, the Committee would be aiming at a
constellation of reserve and money market conditions--essentially involving
no change through the first quarter of '73 in money market conditions from
those prevailing on average in the past few weeks--that would reduce M1
growth only modestly from the rapid 10-1/2 per cent rate expected in the
third quarter. Some slowing in M1 demand in the fourth and first quarters
would be in prospect from the lagged effects of the recent rise in short-
term rates. But by the end of the first quarter, operations under alternative A
would probably have set in train forces leading to quite rapid M1 growth as
","alternative A, alternative A"
1972-12-19,12,"(12) Over the next few weeks, because the market has not yet
adjusted to a 5-1/2 per cent Federal funds rate, persistence of the rate
around that level could lead to a rise in the 3-month bill to around 5-1/4
per cent. However, bill purchases by the public in recent days, partly
related to revenue sharing, have improved the technical position of the bill
market and may moderate very near-term rate adjustments. A movement of
the Federal funds rate above 5-1/2 per cent--as would be contemplated under
alternative C and is possible under alternative B--would set off larger
short-term market rate adjustments. Questions about the discount rate would
become more pressing. And if the funds rate were to penetrate the 6 per cent
level, the accompanying rise in short-term market rates could bring into
question the substainability of ceiling rates on consumer-type time deposits
as net inflows of such deposits decelerated markedly.
","alternative C, alternative B"
1973-02-13,12,"(12) Growth in H1 in February-March is shown at a 7--9 per
cent annual rate in alternative B and at close to those rates in the other
alternatives. These growth rates are more rapid than the longer-run
targets. Given prevailing interest rates, money balances are expected
to pick up temporarily in February and March partly because of larger
than normal payments of tax refunds. With the bulge in Ml growth in the
period ahead, and taking account of the January weakness, expansion in the
first quarter would be around 5--6 per cent. In the second quarter, as
the refunds are phased out, continuation of an M1 growth rate in this range
seems likely at around current money market conditions, given the restrictive
effect on money demand still being exerted by relatively high interest rates,
","alternative B"
1973-03-19,12,"(12) Upward pressures on short- and long-term interest rates
partly reflect the necessity for banks and other savings institutions to
adjust to a significant slowing in the rate of inflow of consumer-type
time and savings deposits. Such a slowing would be expected under alter-
native B, and would be even more marked under alternative C; however, this
does not allow for any change in Regulation Q ceilings on consumer-type
time and savings deposits. Banks and other institutions would have to
adjust to smaller inflows by adopting more stringent commitment policies,
reducing liquidity, and reducing their participation in bond markets. In
addition, large banks would remain aggressive issuers of CD's, and savings
and loan associations would begin borrowing actively from Federal Home
Loan Banks.
Proposed directives
","alternative C"
1973-07-17,12,"(12) The slowing in growth of demand and consumer-type time
deposits will limit bank credit availability. Banks are expected to
attempt to compensate at least in part through sales of large CD's.
However, the high cost of these funds and expected abatement of loan
demand as the economic expansion slows and bank lending terms stiffen are
likely to retard growth in CD's below the second-quarter pace. Under
alternative B, the bank credit proxy in the second half is expected to
increase at a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate, considerably slower than in
the first half.
","alternative B"
1973-08-21,12,"(12) The recent sharp rise in short-term interest rates will be
limiting money demand in the months ahead. As a result, even though growth
in nominal GNP is expected to remain substantial, M1 may expand at a rela-
tively slow pace between now and year-end, given prevailing money market
conditions. For alternative B, a 9-1/2--11-1/2 per cent Federal funds rate
range is shown. This range is symmetrical around current money market con-
ditions. Staff judgment and model forecasts suggest that the odds are better
than even that some decline in the funds rate will develop if the alternative
B targets for the aggregates are pursued, given the degree of restraint
already built into the system.
","alternative B, alternative
B"
1973-09-18,12,"(13) Given the money market conditions of alternative C--indicated
by a Federal funds rate in a 10 to 11 per cent range--growth in consumer-type
time and savings deposits at banks would be expected to slow noticeably as
the realignment of consumer financial asset holdings to the new rate structure
tapers. M2 under alternative C may be expected to rise at about a 5-1/2 per
cent annual rate in the September-October period. The market interest rates
decline envisaged under alternative A and B would lead to greater growth in
consumer-type time deposits than under C and hence to somewhat greater growth
in M2 . Nonbank thrift institutions are expected to remain under pressure in
the months ahead, assuming no change in money market conditions, but the
pressures would moderate a little once the most interest-sensitive depositors
have shifted out. The position of thrift institutions would ease, of course,
as market interest rates decline under alternatives A and B.
","alternative C, alternative C, alternative A"
1973-10-16,12,"(12) Although the interest rate declines anticipated under the
easing alternatives might be fairly sharp, it is quite likely that rates
will turn around, particularly under alternative B. This assumes that
the economy expands as projected in the Greenbook and therefore that the
underlying transactions demand for money will be relatively well maintained
and credit demands will be fairly strong. Thus, under alternative B, bill
rates might be back in the neighborhood of current levels, or perhaps
above them, by around year-end. The degree of any reversal would be
tempered, however, if it proves necessary to reduce the funds rate
somewhat below the bottom of the alternative B range later this year in
order to achieve the desired monetary growth path.
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1973-12-17,12,"(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

1974-01-21,12,"(14) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
are expected to continue at about the November-December pace at banks
and thrift institutions under alternative B, which does not contemplate
significant changes in market rates. Somewhat greater growth would be
likely to evolve under alternative A. There is risk of an appreciable
reduction in savings flows under alternative C if the money market does
in fact tighten as much as shown in paragraph (7).
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1974-02-20,12,"(12) With short-term interest rates having declined by around
one percentage point since the last meeting, market rates have already
moved close to levels that now seem consistent with a 5¾ per cent M1
growth. Thus, little or no further decline would be expected under
alternative B. The Federal funds rate range for that alternative is
indicated at 8¼--9½ per cent, centering close to the recently prevailing
","alternative B"
1974-04-15,12,"(12) Between now and mid-May, short-term interest rates could
decline somewhat under alternative B. Indeed, the very recent drop in
the 3-month bill rate probably is anticipating some of the potential for
downward rate adjustments. Any decline that did develop over the next
few weeks is very likely to be temporary, assuming a 10 per cent Federal
funds rate. Over the longer run, the 3-month bill rate would seem most
likely to fluctuate around a 8 ½--8¾ per cent range.
","alternative B"
1974-05-21,12,"(12) At its last meeting, the Committee established a 5½ per
cent annual rate of growth for M1 from March to September as its longer-
run target. Since then, the March level of M1 has been raised by
$1.3 billion, reflecting revisions for new year-end benchmark data (as
explained in the footnote on page 1). The 4¾ per cent annual rate of
growth for M1 in alternative C has been set to compensate for this
upward revision. As shown in the chart on the following page, such a
growth rate would achieve the M1 level in September that was implicit in
the longer-run path adopted by the Committee at its last meeting.

","alternative C, Alternative B, Alternative A"
1974-06-18,12,"(12) Alternative B encompasses a 5¾ per cent growth rate for M1--
and growth rates of 6¾ and 5½ per cent for M2 and M3 respectively--in
the second half of 1974. These aggregate growth rates appear to be con-
sistent with a Federal funds rate around 11½-11¾ per cent, close to the
center of the range for this alternative. Thus, upward interest rate
pressure under this alternative would be considerably less than under
alternative C. At this writing, interest rates generally appear to be
in process of adjusting to Federal funds trading at rates somewhat above
forthcoming Committee meeting; and little further, if any, upward rate
movement is likely to develop subsequently if the funds rate remains
around the center of alternative B range.
","Alternative B, alternative C, alternative B"
1974-07-16,12,"(12) The ability of banks to finance additional loan demands
is expected to be relatively limited, though. With growth in demand
deposits and consumer-type time deposits constrained, banks will be
under pressure to issue new CD's. However, except for the prime names,
market receptivity to CD's is in some question. In general, the recent
concern with liquidity exposure, on the part of both banks and investors,
will probably reduce the pace at which new CD's will be offered. As a
result, bank credit growth under alternative B is projected at around an
in the first half of the year. This rate of expansion would probably mean
that banks will have to cut back sharply on acquisitions of securities,
particularly municipal and Federal agency issues. Thus, interest rates
in intermediate and longer-term markets would likely come under renewed
upward pressure as time goes on. The bank prime loan rate would probably
also rise somewhat further.
","alternative B"
1974-08-20,12,"(12) Under the Federal funds rates contemplated in any of the
alternatives, the unusually low growth rate of M1 in July would not be
expected to persist in the months ahead, assuming the staff projections
of nominal GNP growth are correct. Taking account of the strengthening
indicated by fragmentary early-August data, M1 would be expected to grow
in a 4¾-6¾ per cent range in the August-September period under alternative B.
","alternative B"
1974-09-10,12,"(12) Adoption of the somewhat higher 5¾ per cent growth rate
of alternative B would be expected to entail a further decline in the
Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to around 11 per cent, the center
of the 10-12 per cent range shown for this alternative. Growth of M1 in the
September-October period in a 3¼-5¼ per cent annual rate range might be
anticipated. Growth over the fourth and first quarters would be con-
siderably higher--around 6-6 per cent, annual rate--to compensate for
the marked weakness expected in September. The stimulative impact of
the easing in money market conditions on money demand would be felt mainly
in the fourth and first quarters; subsequently growth in M1 could be
expected to drop back to around the 5¾ per cent rate.
","alternative B"
1974-10-14,12,"(12) Alternative C involves a Federal funds rate range centering
on 10 per cent, the average rate prevailing in the last full statement
week, M1 expansion in this alternative is expected to be consistent
with a longer-run target rate of growth of 5 per cent, annual rate (from
Aug. '74 to March '75). Over the fourth and first quarters, the rate of
growth would average about 5¾ per cent.
","Alternative C"
1974-11-19,12,"(12) Bank credit growth over the months ahead is likely to
be moderate. In view of concerns about liquidity and capital, banks
have become quite cautious in their lending and investment policies.
While the prime loan rate could be expected to decline further under
either alternative A or B, it would still probably remain high relative
to market rates in the weeks ahead. This would work to temper business
loan growth at banks. Growth in mortgages and consumer loans is likely
to remain weak, as demands remain slack and banks scrutinize loan
applications carefully. Banks may, however, show more interest in
security acquisitions in the period ahead than they have most recently,
particularly under alternative A but also to some extent under
alternative B, to take advantage of the apparent opportunity for
capital gains. We have assumed that banks would be willing in the
months ahead to expand their outstanding CD's at a moderate pace partly
in order to acquire investments.
Proposed directive
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative B"
1974-12-16,12,"(12) Alternative A encompasses a higher 7¼ per cent annual rate
of growth in M1 between now and mid-year. The Federal funds rate under
this alternative would be likely to drop to the 7¼-7½ per cent area by
mid-January. The implications for economic activity and prices of moving
on to such a growth path for M1 will be analyzed in the chart show.
","Alternative A"
1975-02-19,12,"(12) The specifications of alternative B involve attainment
of a 6 per cent rate of growth in M1 by September, rather than by mid-
year. With the target horizon stretched out, interest rates are likely
to decline more moderately over the near-term, and the later upward
movement is likely to be more delayed and probably less sharp. The
annual growth rate for M1 over the first half of this year under
this alternative would be around 4½ per cent, while M2 would expand
at about a 7½ per cent rate.
","alternative B"
1975-03-18,12,"(12) Alternative B shows the pattern of monetary aggregates
that would be associated with little change in money market conditions
from those recently prevailing. The Federal funds rate range centers
on 5¾ per cent. Growth rates in key monetary aggregates would, of course,
be slower than under alternative A--as indexed by a 7 per cent annual
growth rate in M1 over the seven month February-September period and
a 5¼ per cent growth rate over the first nine months of the year.
","Alternative B, alternative A"
1975-04-14,12,"(12) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate remaining
in the 5¼-5½ per cent range most recently prevailing. M1 would be
expected to increase over the two month April-May period in a 7-9 per
cent annual rate range. Growth is expected to be especially large in
May when the largest part of the tax rebates are paid out. This
alternative contemplates about a 7¾ per cent annual rate of growth in
M1, and 11 per cent in M 2, over the second and third quarters.
","Alternative A, alternative c"
1975-06-16,12,"(12) Given prevailing money market conditions, M1 growth over
the June-July period is expected to be in an 8-10 per cent annual rate
range. Growth is expected to slow from the very rapid pace of May and
the first part of June as the effect of Treasury disbursement of tax
rebates wears off. However, disbursement of the $1.7 billion of one-
time payments to social security recipients in the second half of June,
as noted earlier, will tend to sustain private deposits. Thus, any
significant slowdown in M1 growth probably will be delayed until July.
Tightening of the money market over the intermeeting period, as con-
templated under alternative B, would work to lower these growth rates
slightly, but most of the effect of higher interest rates on the monetary
aggregates would develop later on.
","alternative B"
1975-07-15,12,"(12) The short-run specifications for alternative C contemplate
some further near-term tightening of the money market, involving a Federal
funds rate range of 6¼-7¼ per cent for the period until the next meeting.
Adoption of this alternative would introduce an increased monetary restraint
earlier than under alternative B. As a result, the staff would expect that
less additional pressure would have to be exerted on the Federal funds rate
later on to achieve targeted growth in the monetary aggregates over
the next year. Over the July-August period M1 growth under this
alternative would be expected to be at about a 3-5 per cent annual rate,
with growth over the last half of 1975 at around a 6 per cent annual
rate, or one percentage point less than under alternative B.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1975-08-19,12,"(12) Although we anticipate that interest rates would need
to rise substantially as the year progresses under any of the longer-
run scenarios described above, the unchanged money market conditions
of alternative A would probably encourage general interest rate
stability for a time. In the absence of additional money market firming
there might even be some little rally if there are no disquieting
financial developments. Private credit demands remain quite weak on
balance, although there have been some fragmentary indications of the
beginnings of a pickup in recent weeks. The market appears to have
made its adjustment to the higher funds rate now prevailing, and the
Treasury announcement of its somewhat increased third quarter needs
has already been taken into account by market participants.
","alternative A"
1975-09-16,12,"(12) Given the large amount of Treasury borrowing that is
being compressed into the next month or so, as well as the still sensitive
state of the municipal market, a significant rise in the Federal funds
rate--for example, toward the upper end of the 5-3/4--7 per cent range
of alternative A--would likely lead to substantial further yield advances.
Interest rate increases would be accentuated if strengthening credit
demands on banks from businesses and consumers were at the same time
reducing bank willingness to add to Treasury security holdings.
","alternative A"
1975-10-21,12,"(12) Alternative B involves a Federal funds rate range centered
around the recently prevailing 5¾ per cent rate. Yields in short- and
long-term markets (other than the mortgage market) have declined recently in
response to the easing of the money market, and little further decline is
likely in the period immediately ahead, assuming the funds rate remains around
commercial paper may be around 6-3/8 per cent. Bond yields could decline
somewhat further if there should be a breakthrough in resolving New York's
financing problem or if the volume of corporate bond offerings drops further.
However, the Treasury will announce its mid-November refunding on October 22.
While the refunding is a small one--involving only about $2.4 billion of
maturing publicly-held issues--the Treasury may offer mainly longer-term
issues in the financing and is expected to raise a modest amount of new cash
at the same time.
","Alternative B"
1975-11-18,12,"(12) Alternative A contemplates a modest further decline in
the Federal funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting, to the
mid-point of a 4 -5 per cent range. This would tend to strengthen forces
making for a rebound in growth of the monetary aggregates and would also
uncertainties with regard to municipal markets and banks continue. We
would expect that such a reduction in the funds rate would have to be reversed
at least by early next year in order to keep longer-run growth in M1 at
around the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent range, and that by Spring the funds
rate would be around 7¾ per cent.
","Alternative A"
1975-12-16,12,"(12) Under alternative C, a rise in the funds rate to the mid-point
of the 5 -6 per cent range between now and the next meeting is contemplated.
Such a move would likely be accompanied by increases of to ¾ of a percentage
point in other short-term rates and by smaller upward adjustments in longer-
term rates. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks
and thrift institutions would be expected to moderate somewhat from their
recent pace over the next few weeks. Later on, however, they would be subject
to less pressure than under alternatives A or B since the early tightening of
money market conditions would tend to limit the extent to which interest
rates would need to rise in the future in order to keep growth in the
monetary aggregates on target, given the staff's GNP projection.
Proposed directive
","alternative C"
1976-01-20,12,"(12) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate
from the 4¾ per cent level recently prevailing to the mid-point of a 3½-4½
per cent range. Under such circumstances, M1 would be expected to expand
in a 4½-8½ per cent annual rate range in the two-month Jan.-Feb. period,
and M2 in a 7½-11½ per cent range. The pick-up in M1 growth relative to
recent behavior reflects mainly staff expectations that the projected
continuing rise in nominal GNP will be accompanied by resumed expansion
in money demand--given the unusual, and probably unsustainable, rise in the
velocity of money that has already occurred in the current cyclical expansion.
","Alternative A"
1976-02-17,12,"(12) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate
to the mid-point of a 3¾ to 4¾ per cent range, and slightly higher growth
rates for M1 and M2 over the near-term than under alternative B. Such a
drop in the funds rate might be accompanied by only a modest decline in the
earlier. Long-term market rates would probably decline only temporarily,
if at all, in response to a drop in the funds rate, in view of the wide-
spread market expectations of continuing economic recovery and the
likelihood that borrowers would accelerate bond offerings should rates
soften noticeably.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1976-03-15,12,"(12) The forward calendar for corporate and municipal bonds
appears to be relatively substantial over the next few weeks. In addition,
the Treasury may raise some cash through an offering of intermediate-
or longer-term coupon issues. Nevertheless, if the money market remains
stable--as is assumed under alternative B--long-term interest rates are
likely to remain around current levels in view of the strong institutional
investor interest in bonds that has developed since the beginning of the
year. A tightening of the money market, as contemplated under alternative
C, would probably cause some upward adjustment in long rates. Such a near-
term adjustment may be limited, however, if borrowers postpone scheduled
issues--as they may, since many of the issues now on the calendar had been
accelerated to take advantage of propitious market circumstances.
Proposed directive
","alternative B, alternative
C"
1976-04-20,12,"(12) Under alternative C, we expect that interest rates would
have to rise considerably further to achieve a 5 per cent M1 growth from
QI '76 to QI '77. By early 1977, the funds rate might be around 7¾ per
","alternative C"
1976-05-18,12,"(12) Under alternative C, growth in M2 is expected to slow more
markedly over the May-June period. The further rise in the Federal funds
rate that is envisaged would lead to a continued rise in other short-term
rates, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate likely to move up to the 5-3/4-6
per cent area. This would probably lead to a considerable outflow from
savings deposits of those interest-sensitive funds that were shifted into
such accounts when short-term market rates first moved down to around 5 per
cent, the Regulation Q ceiling rate on commercial banks' savings deposits.
","alternative C"
1976-06-22,12,"(12) The specifications of alternative C include a tightening
of the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½
per cent range. This would clearly entail further upward adjustments in
market rates, with the 3-month bill rate moving to the 6 per cent area and
the 3-month commercial paper rate rising to perhaps around 6¼-6½ per cent.
However, such a near-term tightening of the money market would tend to
moderate the need for restraint as the year progresses, as compared with
alternative B. The funds rate under alternative C would be expected to
peak at around 7¼ per cent by late this year, again assuming a 5¾ per cent
growth rate in M1 over the QI '76-QI '77 period,
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1976-07-19,12,"(12) Under alternative B, the annual rate of growth of M1 in the
July-August period is expected to be in a 4½ to 8½ range. (On average from
the second to the third quarter, M 1 is expected to grow at only a 4¾ per
cent annual rate for arithmetic reasons--specifically, because the second
quarter average is high relative to the June level.) Given the projection
for nominal GNP, if growth in M1 over the QII '76-QII '77 period is to be
constrained to 5¾ per cent--the mid-point of the alternative B longer-run
growth range--it is likely that short-term interest rates would have to
begin moving up later in the summer. Under this alternative, the funds rate
is expected to reach 7 per cent in early 1977 and to rise marginally further
in the spring.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1976-09-21,12,"(12) The easing in short-term rates under alternative A
would likely be accompanied by a slightly stronger expansion in M1 over
the short-run--with the M1 growth range estimated to be 4 -8 per cent
for the September-October period. There would be some strengthening
in inflows of time and savings deposits other than large CD's, particularly
savings deposits. However, if credit demands on banks remain relatively
weak over the next few weeks, banks are likely to become less active in
soliciting consumer-type time deposit funds. Banks would probably continue
to run-off large money market CD's, while at the same time taking advantage
of the lower level of market rates to lengthen maturities on those new CD's
that they do issue.
","alternative A"
1976-10-19,12,"(12) The staff would still expect interest rates to rise over
the longer run under alternative B, given the projected pace of economic
activity. However, we would now anticipate a Federal funds rate no higher
than about 6 per cent by mid-'77 and perhaps rising to around 6-1/2 per cent
later that year, as may be seen from Appendix Table II. This represents
both more delayed, and less, interest rate pressure than anticipated
earlier. M2 and M3 would, as a result, probably show somewhat more
strength over the longer run relative to M1 than previously expected--
although growth rates in the broader monetary aggregates would, of
course, be expected to slacken over the next few quarters.
","alternative B"
1976-12-20,12,"(12) An easing of the money market would generate only
slightly more growth in M1 and M2 over the December-January period
than under alternative B. However, the lower level of market rates
will, with a lag, tend to strengthen the demand for money further.
Thus, M1 growth over the longer-run would likely be higher than the
mid-point of the Committee's one-year range. As a result, to contain
growth within desired bounds interest rates under this alternative may
have to rise to somewhat higher levels than under alternative B and
the rise may begin sooner.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1977-03-15,12,"(12) The decline in the funds rate under alternative A would
probably have to be reversed shortly if the Committee is to attain growth
rates in the aggregates within its longer-run ranges. The easing of the
money market would generate more rapid growth in the aggregates over the
next few months than under alternative B, and higher interest rates would
be required later in the year to restrain growth. The tightening of the
money market under alternative C would introduce monetary restraint earlier
in the year and hence would require less of a rise in interest rates by
year-end than either alternative A or B.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1977-04-19,12,"(12) After mid-year, Treasury demands on credit markets will
strengthen considerably. Total private credit demands are also expected
to expand along with continued relatively rapid growth in economic activity.
With demands for money also anticipated to be rather substantial, interest
rates, particularly short-term rates, are likely to rise substantially
in the second half of the year if growth in the monetary aggregates is
to be maintained around the mid-points of the longer-run ranges shown
for alternative B. As shown in appendix III, the staff expects the funds
rate under alternative B to average around 4-7/8 per cent in the current
quarter, to rise to 5½ per cent in the third, and to reach about 6½
per cent by the first quarter of 1978.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1977-05-17,12,"(12) Alternative C contemplates a tightening in money
market conditions over the next few weeks while alternative A involves
an easing. Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would be expected
to rise to the mid-point of a 5¼-6¼ per cent range. This may be a
accompanied by growth in M1 in the May-June period at an annual rate
in a range of ½-4½ per cent--about ½ point slower than under alternative
B. The immediate retarding effect on M2 is expected to be somewhat
greater under alternative C. With the funds rate rising to around 5¾
per cent, the 3-month bill rate may adjust up to the 5½-5¾ per cent
area. Such a substantial further rise in short-term rates to a level
well above the ceiling rate on savings deposits is likely to trigger a
sizable outflow of savings funds to market instruments.
","Alternative C, alternative A, alternative C, alternative
B, alternative C"
1977-06-21,12,"(12) The staff projections suggest that under alternative B
the Federal funds rate would have to advance to an average of about 6
per cent in the first quarter of next year if M-1 growth in the QI '77-
QI '78 period is to be held near the mid-point of the Committee's
shown in the last blue book, reflecting both the slower second-quarter
growth of the aggregates than projected then and the slightly slower
growth of nominal GNP now expected in late 1977 and early 1978. Inflows
of interest-bearing deposits are still expected to slow sufficiently to
keep growth in M-2 and M-3 in the lower part of their respective one-year
","alternative B"
1977-09-20,12,"(12) Between now and the next Committee meeting an upward
adjustment in the funds rate to around the 6-5/8 per cent mid-point
of the alternative C range would probably be associated with an increase
in the 3-month Treasury bill rate to the 6¼-6½ per cent area. Other
short-term rates would adjust commensurately, member bank borrowing from
the discount window may once again rise substantially, and pressures
for another upward adjustment of the discount rate would build. Long-
term rates would probably rise for a time in response to the advance
in short rates, but in the absence of indications of stronger economic
activity or of a worsening of inflationary pressures such rate increases
are not likely to be sustained.
","alternative C"
1977-11-15,12,"(12) Inflows to thrift institutions moderated somewhat in
October. Such inflows may moderate somewhat further over the next few
weeks under alternative B, and can be expected to decelerate markedly in
deceleration at thrifts--and at banks as well--is not likely to be as
marked as might be expected from interest rate considerations alone
because of the high level of nominal income growth projected for 1978
and the large volume of longer-term time certificates now outstanding at
depository institutions. This would tend to moderate the extent to which
thrifts will have to increase their borrowing and reduce liquidity in
order to meet outstanding mortgage commitments.
","alternative B"
1977-12-19,12,"(12) Growth in M-2 over the December-January period is likely
to be in a 6-10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
Commercial bank savings deposits, after contracting in November, are
likely to resume modest growth over the period, even though market
yields will remain above rate ceilings on such deposits, as the most
interest sensitive holders have probably shifted to other instruments.
Small denomination time deposits with maturities in excess of 4 years,
whose rates are still above those on marketable securities of com-
parable maturity, are also expected to grow moderately in the December-
January period. As in October-November, however, most of the expansion
in the interest bearing component of M-2 is likely to occur in large
denomination time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings.
","alternative B"
1978-02-28,12,"(13) The February-March growth rate of M-1 shown under alterna-
tive B implies a first quarter expansion of about 4-3/4 per cent, annual
rate, well within the Committee's 4 to 6-1/2 per cent longer-run range.
However, the staff anticipates that further increases in market interest
rates will be required in order to constrain M-1 growth over the one-
year QIV '77 - QIV '78 period to the mid-point of that range. Even
though the staff has reduced its projection of economic growth this year,
nominal GNP is still expected to increase at an 11-1/4 per cent rate over
the QIV '77 - QIV '78 period, leading to relatively strong money demand.
In addition, the restraining impact on money demand from the relatively
sharp 1-3/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates that
took place between the spring and fall of last year will be exhausted
relatively soon; since October short-rates have risen only about another
in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably
have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order
to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point
of the 4 to 6-1/2 per cent alternative B range.1/
","alternative B"
1978-03-21,12,"(12) If the Federal funds rate remains at the 6¾ per
cent level contemplated under alternative B, short- and intermediate-
term interest rates over the intermeeting period are likely to
remain near their current levels. Some upward rate pressures
might develop as accelerating economic activity bolsters financing
demands of businesses at banks and in the commercial paper market.
In addition, Treasury borrowing in short- and intermediate-term
markets between now and mid-April will be relatively heavy.
Potential upward rate pressures in the short-term sector will tend
to be offset, however, by market anticipation of the substantial
pay-down of Treasury bills following the mid-April tax date.
Moreover, rates on shorter-term Treasury securities could remain
low relative to other market rates, should foreign central banks
continue to acquire large amounts of such securities as a result
of their intervention activities in foreign exchange markets.

quarter should be reflected in accelerated growth in M-l over the

April-May period. As contemplated under alternative B, a Federal funds
rate centered on the recently prevailing 6-3/4 per cent level is likely
to be associated with M-1 growth over the two-month period at an annual
rate in a 6 to 10 per cent range. In terms of quarterly averages, we
would expect expansion in M-1 from the first to the second quarter to
be at a rate of about 6 per cent. However, growth would be more
rapid over the course of the second quarter--with M-1 expansion at
about an 7½ per cent rate from March to June.
","alternative B"
1978-05-16,12,"(13) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 7½ to 8¼ per cent range between
now and mid-June. M-1 growth would likely be in a 4 to 8 per cent
annual rate range over May and June and M-2 growth in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2
per cent range. Under this alternative, short-term rates generally
might rise 1/2 percentage point or a little more. With loan demands
expected to remain sizable, relatively prompt upward adjustments
in the prime loan rate may be anticipated. Moreover, a rise in
member bank borrowings would also increase pressure for another
discount rate adjustment. Bond yields too could be expected to
rise, though increases may be limited since current market yields
have probably anticipated some further monetary tightness. The
widening spread between interest rates in the United States and
the rest of the world would tend to provide support for the exchange
value of the dollar.
","Alternative B"
1978-06-20,12,"(12) If the Federal funds rate were maintained around the
currently prevailing levels of 7½ per cent, as envisioned under
Alternative A, most other short-term rates would likely also show
little net change over the very near term. Following their most
recent increases, both commercial paper and CD rates now are aligned
with the Federal funds rate in roughly the same relationship that
has prevailed throughout the current expansion. Although the 3-month
Treasury bill rate has risen in recent weeks, it still remains low
relative to other short-term rates. However, its spread of 75 to 100
basis points below other rates is not likely to be closed signifi-
cantly in the next few weeks. Available supplies will be depleted by
Treasury redemptions of cash-management bills and by System purchases
to offset the effects of the build-up in Treasury cash balances
following the June tax date. With staff projections
suggesting continued strength in the money stock, short-term rates
could, nevertheless, begin to move higher during the intermeeting
period if and as market participants come to anticipate further
tightening of monetary policy.
","Alternative A"
1978-08-15,12,"(12) If the funds rate were to move up to the mid-point of
the 7¾ to 8½ per cent alternative B range, the upward adjustment
in market rates would likely be prompt and marked. The 3-month bill
rate should move toward 7¼ per cent, and pressures on the CD and
commercial paper rates should generate a further rise in the prime
loan rate. The rise of interest rates on Treasury coupon issues
would probably reverse all of the recent decline in such yields,
and perhaps go somewhat further. And corporate bond yields may
also rise fairly substantially given the prevailing narrow rate spread
between Treasury and corporate issues.
","alternative B"
1978-09-19,12,"(12) If the Federal funds rate remains around 8-3/8 per cent
over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under alternative A, short-
term market interest rates would be expected to remain near current
levels. The recent increases in short-term rates appear to have kept
them in alignment with the funds rate. Although short-term credit
demands of both financial and nonfinancial businesses may pick up in
September and October, following a weakening in August, they are likely
to remain more moderate than over the first half of the year. Demands
for short-term funds from sponsored agencies should moderate somewhat
in the weeks ahead from their strong summer pace,in view of the recent
strength in thrift deposit flows, and the Treasury will probably not
tap the bill market for new money until the latter part of the fourth
","alternative A"
1978-10-17,12,"(12) The longer-run ranges for M-2 and M-3 have been
raised relative to M-1. Thus, under alternative B, M-2 growth for
the year ahead is expected to be in a 7 to 9½ per cent range and
M-3 growth in an 8 to 11 per cent range, ½ and 1 percentage point
higher than current longer-run ranges. The M-2 range was raised
to take account of the recent somewhat more rapid growth in time
deposits other than large CD's and to allow for a modest shift from
deposits at thrift institutions to ATS accounts at banks.2/ The
range for M-3 was raised more substantially in recognition of the
apparent ability, and also willingness, of savings institutions,
especially S&L's, to raise substantial amounts of new money through
the 6-month money market certificate. Of course, net inflows of
deposits to thrifts should slow from its recent pace in the months
ahead, as rising interest rates further moderate inflows of deposits
subject to fixed rate-ceilings, the effects of the stock adjustment
from other financial assets wane, and depository institutions perhaps
become less aggressive in offering the new certificates as the spread
continues to narrow between their deposit costs and mortgage rates.
","alternative B"
1979-04-17,12,"(12) Financial markets in the weeks ahead may be subject to
some of the same conflicting pressures as in recent weeks--continued high
inflation, a strengthened dollar, and increased uncertainty about the
future course of economic activity. In such an environment, even
stability in the funds rate, as contemplated under alternative B, could
be associated with relatively wide fluctuations in interest rates arising
from changing expectations. Apart from expectational factors, underlying
demand-supply forces appear in reasonable balance. A large paydown of
Treasury cash management bills in the latter part of April may exert
downward pressures on very short-term interest rates, but this could
be offset by continued sales of bills by foreign official institutions
should the dollar continue strong.
","alternative B"
1979-07-11,12,"(12) Alternatives A and C, respectively, represent somewhat
easier and tighter policies with regard to the aggregates. Alternative A
is indexed by measured M-1 growth centered around 5 percent (6-1/2 per-
cent after adjustment for ATS effects) and alternative C by measured
growth of around 4 percent (5-1/2 percent after ATS effects). These
growth rates can be viewed as representing orderly movement toward rates
of increase in M-1 (adjusted for ATS effects) of 7 and 5 percent respectively
in 1980, with the slightly different growth rates for 1979 reflecting
the relatively short period remaining this year in which to influence
the growth of the aggregate. For alternatives A and B, the M-2 ranges
are the same because the lower interest rates under alternative A more
promptly open the ceiling rate differential on MMCs favoring thrift
institutions, thereby diverting funds from commercial bank time deposits
to thrift deposits. In all alternatives, growth ranges for bank credit
are above the current range, because of the relatively rapid growth in
such credit thus far this year.
","Alternative A, alternative C, alternative A"
1979-09-18,12,"(12) M-2 growth also is projected to decelerate under alternative
B, expanding at a 7 to 11 percent annual rate during the September-October
period. Most of the slowdown reflects the moderation of M-1 growth, but,
in light of the current higher level of market interest rates, the rate of
expansion of savings and small time deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings
is expected to moderate. However, commercial banks should continue to
capture a relatively large proportion of flows into 6-month MMCs. With
loan demands likely to moderate only slightly in the near term, banks
are also expected to continue to issue large time deposits and borrow from
M-1 growth by 3 percentage points. In July, when the range was re-
adopted, it was estimated that ATS effects for the year would be about
half as large. At present, we estimate that such ATS effects will
reduce measured M-1 growth by a little less than 1½ percentage points.
On this basis, an adjusted range of 3 to 6 percent, or even a little
higher, would be comparable with 1½ to 4¼ percent.
growth in this aggregate in 1979 would be at the upper end of its
adjusted longer-run range.

despite their likely further use of large time deposits.

B"
1979-11-20,12,"(12) Alternative B involves acceleration in money growth rates
over the balance of the year from their recent pace, with M-1 expanding
at a 5 percent annual rate on average in November and December and M-2
at a 9 percent rate. Since the latest data suggest that M-1 in mid-
November is quite low relative to path, a considerable spurt of M-1 growth
in the last half of November and in December is needed to achieve the
objective in this alternative. This would probably be reflected mainly
in a rapid December growth rate.
","Alternative B"
1980-03-18,12,"(12) Business external financing requirements are expected to
remain substantial in the second quarter as capital outlays are projected
to move higher while internal cash flow falls off. It is possible that
some of the financing need may have already been met to the extent that the
recent surge in borrowing at banks reflected anticipation of credit controls.
Even so, there is likely to be some conflict between business borrowing
needs in the near-term and the special credit restraint program. If the
guidelines of that program are followed, they would imply a marked slowing
in loan growth, given the relatively rapid growth that has already occurred
this year. However, if the new program leads to a reduction of inflationary
expectations, the associated drop that is likely to occur in bond yields
may divert some business borrowing to that market. On balance, it seems
likely that bank credit growth will slow in the months ahead from the very
rapid January-February pace, but still may be large enough to require banks
to continue to issue high cost managed liabilities. Thrifts and mortgage
markets too are likely to remain under considerable tension in the months
ahead absent any substantial decline in short-term rates over the near-term--
which seems unlikely given the monetary targets of alternative B.
","alternative B"
1980-04-22,12,"(12) Bank credit growth under any of the alternatives is likely
to pick up over the next few months from the low March pace, although a
return to the elevated January-February rates is unlikely in light of the
Board's guidelines for bank loan expansion and the projected weakening of
economic activity. With the marginal reserve requirement on managed
liabilities also discouraging bank credit expansion, bank issuance of
large time deposits and other open market liabilities is expected to be
somewhat lower than in the first quarter. M-3 growth under alternative B
is projected at a 6½ percent annual rate over the March-June span,
considerably slower than in the first three months of the year.
","alternative B"
1980-05-20,12,"(12) Looking beyond the current quarter, some upward pressure
on interest rates might develop. The recent weakness in M-1A has left it
well short of what might have been expected on the basis of historical
relationships among money, income, and interest rates. Thus, although
nominal GNP is projected to rise at only a 5½ percent annual rate in the
second half of the year, our econometric models would suggest that, at
current interest rates, money would tend to grow much more rapidly than
that, and probably somewhat in excess of the 7½ percent alternative A path,
as the public attempts to restore recently depleted cash balances. This
would generate upward rate pressures at a time when income velocity of M-1A
would be declining, a reversal of the normal situation.1/ If, however,
the recent evident weakness in M-1A should prove largely to represent a
lasting shift in the public's liquidity preferences, then upward rate
pressures might be minimal, or indeed there could be some further downward
drift in rates.
","alternative A"
1980-08-12,12,"(12) Under alternative A, given the demand for transactions
balances implied by the staff's stronger economic projection for the
current quarter, money market interest rates are likely to remain at the
higher levels attained recently. Aggregate credit demands may pick up,
especially in the household sector. The runoff in consumer installment
debt likely will slow, while the demand for home mortgages probably will
strengthen somewhat. Borrowing by the Treasury and state and local
governments will remain quite large. In the business sector, although
total borrowing probably will rise in coming weeks, a significant portion
of the increase will reflect a rebuilding of liquidity positions.
","alternative A"
1980-09-16,12,"(12) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under
alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 6 percent
annual rate from August to December, and, given the near-term pattern of
growth, by about a 7 percent annual rate from August to October. Assuming
adjustment borrowing of around $600 million--close to the average of recent
weeks but below the level expected for the current statement week--the
nonborrowed reserve path would call for growth at little over a 4
percent annual rate from August to October, with the federal funds rate
probably around 10-1/2--10-3/4 percent.
","alternative A"
1980-10-21,12,"(12) The higher federal funds rate and increased member bank
borrowing likely to be associated with alternative A would probably be
accompanied by an upward adjustment in both short- and long-term market
interest rates. Upward rate pressures would be intensified by the need to
finance a substantial Treasury deficit in prospect for the fourth quarter.
However, the pressures on rates could abate as the quarter progresses. A
rising level of long-term yields is likely to inhibit further the pace of
new corporate and municipal bond offerings. And if signs of a weakening
in economic activity emerge, as would be consistent with the staff's GNP
projections, expectations of future rate declines would become more prevalent
and influence the actual market rate structure.
","alternative A"
1980-11-18,12,"(12) The further increase in interest rates under alternative
Deposit flows are projected to decelerate, but to remain relatively ample.
Nonetheless, mortgage rates would be expected to rise considerably in
reflection of the increases in the cost of deposit funds and yields on
alternative assets. With mortgage rates already at levels that have begun
to choke off demand, new commitment activity for longer-term residential
mortgages at thrift institutions would probably become quite depressed.
","alternative a"
1981-03-31,12,"(12) The projected strengthening of demand for transactions
balances implies that interest rates will probably be under upward pressure
over the coming quarter, particularly under the alternative B and C speci-
fications, but also possibly to a degree under alternative A. Under
alternative A--which involves growth in total reserves from March to June
at a 9-3/4 percent annual rate-we would expect the funds rate to be
in a 14 to 16 percent range over the next few-weeks, with borrowing at the
discount window ranging around $1 billion, given the current discount rate
structure. Many market participants appear to be expecting rate declines in
the months ahead. For example, in the futures market, 3-month bills for
June delivery are quoted at 11-7/8 percent, as compared to the current cash
market quote of around 13 percent. Against this backdrop, a failure of the
funds rate to decline from current levels would tend to exert upward pressure
on short-term interest rates generally. Of course, if money demand tends to
be on the weak side this spring-as could well develop if the economy is even
less strong than projected-lower funds rates, borrowing, and market rates
generally would occur.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative A"
1981-05-18,12,"(12) Alternatives B and C would call for a growth in total
reserves over the April to June period at annual rates of 6 and 4 percent,
respectively. A federal funds rate around 20 percent or a bit higher is
likely to emerge over the next few weeks under alternative B, while the
funds rate under C could rise further. Given current discount rates,
borrowing at the discount window might rise to around the $2 billion
area under alternative B and to around $3 billion under alternative C.
Of course, any increase in the present discount rate level and structure
would work to reduce the demand for borrowing. Other short-term rates
would probably rise substantially further under these alternatives, with
upward pressures particularly intense under alternative C. Long-term
interest rates would also rise further over the weeks ahead, probably
inducing a large volume of postponements and cancellations of bond
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative C, alternative C"
1981-08-18,12,"(12) The alternative B specifications imply growth of total
reserves from July to September at an 11 percent annual rate. The federal
funds rate probably would be around 19 percent or higher during the
intermeeting period, and, given the present discount rate structure,
borrowing would likely run around $1½ to $2 billion. Under alternative B,
market interest rates, especially short-term rates, are likely to rise,
perhaps appreciably. Pressure on thrift institution earnings would be
more intense under this alternative than under alternative A, and mortgage
rates would probably rise further. Longer-term market rates may also rise,
at least temporarily, in reflection of higher costs of financing positions;
business credit demands would continue to be centered on short-term markets.
The dollar would remain under upward pressure in foreign exchange markets.
Directive language
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative A"
1981-10-05,12,"(12) Total reserves would need to expand at a 3 percent annual
rate over the last three months of the year if the monetary specifications
of alternative C are to be achieved. Adjustment borrowing at the discount
window would probably vary between $900 million and $1.2 billion, given
the current structure of discount rates and a federal funds rate in the area
of 15 to 16 percent. Nonborrowed reserves would be targeted to expand at a
","alternative C"
1981-11-17,12,"(12) The more rapidly short-term interest rates decline over
the weeks ahead, the greater the odds that rates will rebound in early
tentatively set, with the degree of rebound, if any, depending in part
on the underlying resilience of the economy. Alternatives B and C, which
involve reducing the Committee's fourth quarter target for M1-B set at
the last meeting, would tend to limit downward pressures on interest rates
between now and year-end and possibly work toward a smoother transition
to targets for 1982. Because it is so late in 1981, the impact on annual
growth of the aggregates this year from adoption of either of these
alternatives rather than continuing with alternative A would be relatively
small, as may be noted from the detailed tables on pp. 6 and 7.
","alternative A"
1982-02-01,12,"(12) Continuation of the short-run policy toward M1 adopted
at the last meeting is shown as alternative A in the table below. This
option would bring M1 into the upper half of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer-
run range by March, assuming this long-run range is based, as has been
the case in the past, on the actual average level of M1 in the fourth
quarter of the previous year.1/ The risk of sharp interest rate fluctua-
tions that might be associated with alternative A, accompanied by
potentially adverse implications for economic activity and financial
markets, might be reduced by extending beyond the first quarter the
horizon over which the Committee targets the return of M1 to within the
tentative 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range--as is contemplated by the
three other alternatives in the table. (More detailed and longer-run data
for the alternatives are contained in the table and charts on the
following pages).

","alternative A, alternative A"
1982-05-18,12,"(12) Alternative A, which calls for a 4 percent annual rate of
growth in M1 from March to June, probably would result in appreciable
interest rate reductions along the maturity spectrum. While relatively
little money growth is implied by this alternative in May and June on
average, money demands are expected to be quite weak over the balance of
the quarter, given the build-up in money balances through April. The
funds rate might move to a level somewhat above the current discount rate,
with borrowing dropping to around $500 million. Total reserves would
expand over May and June at about an 8 percent annual rate and nonborrowed
reserves at a 20 percent rate. Growth in M2 could be expected to be
somewhat higher than under alternative B, largely reflecting the stronger
growth in M1 and possibly greater interest in MMCs and MMMFs, both of
whose yields lag declines in market rates.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1982-10-05,12,"(12) Growth of M2 would also be at a relatively moderate 8-1/2
percent pace under alternative B over the last three months of the year.
Expansion in the nontransactions component of M2 may speed up from September,
but is likely to remain below the very rapid pace of July and August. Money
market fund growth should remain slow, and some part of the sizable volume
of ASCs maturing in October might shift to market instruments, particularly
municipals, though the staff believes that the bulk will be either rolled
","alternative B"
1982-12-20,12,"(12) It would appear that alternative B would be consistent
with a federal funds rate around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate,
or edging down further, and other market interest rates generally little
changed. The 3-month Treasury bill rate may continue in a 7-1/2 to 8 per-
cent range, with private rates running about 1/2 to 3/4 of a percentage
point higher; however, a failure of the economy to show generalized signs
of a revival in aggregate demand--as the market might infer from weak
retail sales and similar incoming data for December, should that develop--
could well lead to anticipatory rate declines. The prime loan rate could
drop somewhat from its current 11-1/2 percent level, given its spread
over prevailing open market rates. Mortgage rates might come under some
further downward pressure if inflows into the new accounts at thrifts
induce these institutions to step up their new commitment activity.
","alternative B"
1984-03-26,12,"(12) The market has probably not entirely discounted the
degree of reserve restraint implied by alternative B, and interest rates
generally would be expected to increase somewhat further, with the Trea-
sury bill rate possibly moving up about 1/4 percentage point to around
discount rate. Longer-term market rates should also rise a little fur-
ther, particularly as the market absorbs the recently announced $15 bil-
lion package of Treasury coupon issues (to be auctioned in the week of
the FOMC meeting). The prime rate would again come under pressure as
the spread over 3-month CDs narrowed to less than one percentage point
after allowance for reserve requirements. With thrift institution
earnings deteriorating as rates rose, the spread of mortgage rates over
bond rates might begin to widen. The dollar may continue to hold its
recent gains, and perhaps even rise somewhat further, for a time, as
investors react not only to the higher returns on dollar assets but
also to the signal of determination to combat inflation. However,
over time the dollar is expected to resume declining in light of the
large and growing current account deficit.
","alternative B"
1984-05-21,12,"(12) Interest rates generally may well continue to fluctuate
around current levels under alternative B, but credit markets are in a
highly sensitive state. The behavior of quality spreads will depend in
part on the extent to which concerns about banks are allayed by the
Continental package. Long-term interest rates have been extremely
volatile recently, and they will no doubt continue to be sensitive to
incoming economic data, statements by officials, and the outlook for the
budget. Nonetheless, the severity of the decline in bond prices in
recent weeks suggests that this market--where yields have risen as much
or more than short-term rates--could have overadjusted, and, if short
rates do not rise further, some decline in long-term rates could develop.
However, even if bond rates fell, mortgage rates probably would continue
to move higher in lagged response to previous increases in market
interest rates and to emerging earnings pressures on thrift lenders.
","alternative B"
1984-08-21,12,"(12) There is little reason to expect the average level of
short-term rates to change much over the balance of the quarter under
alternative B, but the structure of these rates could well vary, depending
on such factors as the evolution of the FCA situation and the progress of
negotiations with Latin American borrowers. It seems most probable that
lingering uncertainties would keep quality spreads, which have narrowed
modestly on balance since the last meeting, from improving further.
Long-term bond markets, too, are unlikely to continue the improvement
that was seen in the early part of the intermeeting period, unless
economic activity appears to be much weaker than anticipated. A noticeable
back-up in rates cannot be ruled out in the weeks ahead, particularly
should money growth accelerate more rapidly than projected in the context
of strong economic indicators.
","alternative B"
1984-11-07,12,"(12) The aggregate specifications of alternative B are thought
to involve pressures on bank reserve positions indexed by discount window
borrowing of around $700 million. This is expected to be associated with
a federal funds rate averaging around 10 percent, given the apparent
considerable diminution in banks' reluctance to borrow over recent weeks
and also assuming that the ""frictional "" level of borrowing is, at $300
to $400 million, somewhat higher than usual. Such an assumption for
""frictional"" borrowing appears consistent with the recent sustained level
of seasonal borrowing at an unusually large $300 million. After declining
sharply in October, nonborrowed and total reserves would be expected to
expand at annual rates of around 9 and 6 percent, respectively, over the
last two months of the year.
","alternative B"
1984-12-17,12,"(12) Discount window borrowing under alternative B is expected
to average around $400 million. That level of borrowing appears to be
somewhat in excess of the likely ""frictional"" level, which now is probably
around $150 to $250 million. Seasonal borrowing has declined to close to
$100 million since the last FOMC meeting in accord with its normal seasonal
pattern and in response to the slimmer spread between market and discount
rates. Under these circumstances, federal funds might average mostly in
a range around 8-3/4 percent. Nonborrowed reserves would be expected to
increase at a 16 percent annual rate, and total reserves at a 12-1/2 percent
rate over the November-to-March period.
","alternative B"
1985-03-26,12,"(12) The money growth objectives of alternative B are expected
to involve continuation of about the existing degree of pressure on
reserve positions, with reserve paths based on adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing at the discount window averaging around $350 million and
federal funds expected to trade around 8-1/2 percent. Seasonal borrowing
has averaged around $80 million in recent weeks, and with the spread of
the federal funds rate over the discount rate likely to remain fairly
narrow under this alternative, seasonal borrowing would ordinarily be
expected to increase only moderately further over the intermeeting period.
If availability of the temporary simplified seasonal borrowing program or
liquidity pressures at some agricultural banks were to result in an
unusual rise in seasonal borrowing over the intermeeting period, or if
adjustment borrowing rose substantially for special reasons, such as the
situation in Ohio, such borrowing increases above normal could be treated
as in effect ""nonborrowed"" reserves in the conduct of open market opera-
tions. Nonborrowed reserves are anticipated to expand at about a 10
percent annual rate over the next three months, and total reserves by
about 9 percent, to meet the money objectives of this alternative and if
demands for excess reserves are in the $600 to $700 million range.
","alternative B, alternative a"
1985-05-21,12,"(12) As compared with alternative B, alternative C involves
tighter reserve conditions thought more likely to be consistent with
constraining M1 growth to the 6 percent path for March to June chosen
by the Comittee at its last meeting. Expansion at this rate would leave
M1 quite close to, though still a bit above, the upper limit of its band.
This alternative, which contemplates M1 growth of a little under 5 percent
in June, would be expected to entail adjustment plus seasonal borrowing,
excluding that by thrifts in special situations, of around $450-$500
million. The pick-up in growth of the broader aggregates would be somewhat
less rapid under this alternative, with M2 and M3 expanding in a 5-3/4 to
","alternative B, alternative C"
1985-10-01,12,"(12) Growth of M2 and M3 is also expected to slow in the
September-to-December period under alternative B, owing primarily to the
deceleration of their M1 component. This slowing would bring M2 to the
upper bound of its annual range by the fourth quarter, implying average
growth in the fall quarter more in line with, though still above, the
projected expansion of nominal GNP. M3 should remain around the middle
of its long-run range. Issuance of managed liabilities is anticipated
to pick up as core deposit growth slows. Banks may more actively offer
such liabilities, however, should they decide to enlarge their securities
portfolios greatly given the unusually heavy fourth-quarter issuance of
Treasury debt and tax-exempt securities.
","alternative B"
1985-11-04,12,"(12) Alternative A contemplates an easing of reserve pres-
sures, with discount window borrowing falling to $200 to $300 million
and the federal funds rate dropping to around the 7-1/2 percent discount
rate. Growth of the monetary aggregates under this alternative would be
expected to be consistent with the 6 to 7 percent range for the September-
December period adopted for all three aggregates at the last meeting. M1
would increase at a 9-1/2 percent annual rate over the last two months of
the year, and growth from the second quarter base of its long-run range
would remain above 11 percent through December. A somewhat larger increase
cannot be ruled out, though, as the spread of market rates over NOW
account rates narrows further into a range where we have had limited
experience with saver response in the NOW account era. M2 growth would
also be stronger, bringing this aggregate closer to, though still a
little below, the upper end of its range; flows into MMDAs and money
market funds would accelerate as rates on these instruments lagged the
decline in market rates. The pickup in M3, on the other hand, might be
restrained as business loan demand at banks was held down by a greater
issuance of bonds.
","Alternative A"
1986-05-20,12,"(12) The specifications of alternative A contemplate a less
marked deceleration of M over the rest of the quarter, with growth in
June close to 9 percent. Indeed, even this degree of slowing might not
emerge by midyear, given the possibility of a very substantial interest
sensitivity of this aggregate as opportunity costs narrow even further.
Growth of the more liquid components of nontransactions M2 also would
remain quite strong, limiting the slowing in M2 growth, and this aggregate
would be boosted to near the middle of its long-run range. With the
strength in core deposits holding down needs for managed liabilities, M3
would be expected to grow around 7-1/2 percent over the last two months
of the quarter, remaining a bit above the midpoint of its range.
","alternative A"
1986-09-23,12,"(12) M1 growth, though expected to moderate somewhat from its
July-August pace, is still likely to be quite rapid over the rest of the
year under alternative B. With offering rates on NOW accounts adjusting
only slowly, inflows to other checkable deposits would continue to be
boosted by funds shifting from small time deposits as well as from market
instruments, though abating from their recent extraordinary pace. Growth
in demand deposits should taper off, as holdings become more fully adjusted
to the earlier declines in short-term market rates. Based on the staff's
GNP projection, transactions needs are likely to increase in the fourth
quarter at around the third-quarter pace. Reflecting the influence of the
previous narrowing in opportunity costs of M1 balances, M1 velocity is
expected to contract at a 7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter,
after a 12 percent decline in the current quarter.
","alternative B"
1986-11-05,12,"(12) M1, under alternative B, would be anticipated to expand in
November and December at about the reduced average September-October pace-
as a rebound in demand deposit growth would offset some moderation in in-
flows to OCDs. Opportunity costs of holding OCD balances would likely widen
a little more as offering rates on NOW accounts continue to edge lower in
adjustment to earlier rate declines. M1 growth on a quarterly-average
basis would be at a 14 percent rate in the fourth quarter, implying a 10
percent rate of decline in its velocity. For the year, M1 velocity would
register an 8-1/2 percent drop, the steepest annual decline in the postwar
","alternative B"
1987-03-31,12,"(12) Under alternative B, expansion of M1 is anticipated to
strengthen to a 9 percent annual rate over March to June. The acceleration
in M1 would reflect a resumption of growth in demand deposits, which are
anticipated to increase at a rate only a little below the projected growth
of spending. OCDs are expected to grow at around the reduced pace of
February and March; however, with opportunity costs widening only a little
further with the continued downward drift of offering rates, the pace of
growth would still considerably exceed that of income. On a quarterly
average basis, M1 would rise at a 7-1/2 percent rate in the second quarter,
the slowest rate since late 1984, and its velocity would decline at only a
at about a 10 percent annual rate.
","alternative B"
1987-05-19,12,"(12) Owing to the clearing of tax payments in late April and early
May, M1 likely will be flat in May on a monthly average basis before rebound-
ing in June to around an 8 percent annual rate under alternative B. June
growth would represent a moderation from the average pace since the fourth
quarter of last year, in response to the upward movement of market interest
rates. There is some chance that the deceleration could be even more marked,
should depositors be particularly sensitive to widening spreads between rates
on small time deposits and OCDs. Under alternative B, quarterly average growth
for M1, at 7-1/2 percent, still would slightly exceed projected GNP expansion,
implying a decline in M1 velocity for the tenth straight quarter.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1987-08-18,12,"(12) Moderate increases in M1 also are expected over the balance
of the quarter as interest-rate effects recede. Since mid-July, growth of
both demand deposit balances and NOW accounts has resumed, and expansion of
M1 at a 5-1/4 percent rate is expected on average over August and September
under alternative B. But the arithmetic effect of weakness in June and July
implies quarterly average growth of less than 1 percent in the current quarter
and a velocity increase of almost 6 percent, the largest advance since early
","alternative B"
1987-09-22,12,"(12) Growth in M3 from August to December is anticipated at a 6
percent rate under alternative B. This would be a little stronger than its
pace earlier in the year, and would move this aggregate close to, though not
quite within, its longer-run range. Bank credit growth, and associated
issuance of managed liabilities in M3, should be buoyed by additional reli-
ance by businesses on short-term sources of funds, given increasing financing
needs and the rise in bond rates. Despite some moderation in total mortgage
flows owing to higher interest rates and reduced housing market activity, the
renewed borrower interest in ARMs should support growth in thrift assets and
managed liabilities in M3. Consumer credit growth may slacken substantially
after the current round of automobile incentive programs ends and spending
on cars and other durables weakens. Total borrowing by domestic nonfinancial
sectors is expected to strengthen a bit in the fourth quarter, reflecting
entirely a pickup in federal borrowing to finance a larger deficit. For the
year, debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to rise by 9-1/2
percent on a quarterly average basis, in the middle of the annual range for
this aggregate.
","alternative B"
1987-11-03,12,"(12) The table below presents outcomes for money growth from
September to December that might be expected to accompany each of these
alternatives.1/ The margin of uncertainty surrounding these point estimates
is considerably larger than usual. The extent to which heightened liquidity
preferences together with substantial variations in the volumes of financial
transactions could affect future demands for the monetary aggregates is
difficult to gauge at present. How quickly money markets and depositories
will re-establish a more normal structure of short-term market and deposit
interest rates--and therefore the movement of opportunity costs--under each
alternative also is hard to assess.

","alternative a"
1987-12-15,12,"(12) M3 is expected to grow at a 6 percent annual rate from Novem-
ber to March under alternative B, about the same pace as in recent
months; such growth would keep this aggregate through March well within
its tentative range for 1988. Flows to institution-only money funds
should weaken substantially as their returns move down into more normal
alignment with market rates. However, bank credit expansion is likely
to rebound in coming months from its November pause, and thrift asset
growth should be well maintained, buoyed by continued large acquisitions
of ARMs. Overall household mortgage and consumer credit expansion in
the first quarter is expected to stay around the reduced fourth-quarter
pace, as housing activity and consumer durables spending remain about
flat. Business borrowing is expected to be sizable, as the financing
gap remains appreciable, while share retirements fall back only
modestly. State and local bond issuance should continue near its recent
subdued pace, but a substantial volume of federal government borrowing
is anticipated to finance the higher deficit. In all, the debt of
domestic nonfinancial sectors in March is expected to stand 9 percent at
an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base--the midpoint of its 7-1/2
to 10-1/2 percent tentative range for 1988.
","alternative B"
1988-02-09,12,"(12) The more rapid growth associated with the Alternative I
ranges could be considered necessary to offset the shortfall from last year,
if that shortfall were thought to point to substantial risks on the side of
weak demands in the economy. Significantly lower interest rates might be
needed to support income growth if demands in the U.S. economy from domestic
or foreign sources were appreciably below expectations. Such a fall in
rates is likely to involve much faster M2 growth, perhaps even exceeding the
upper end of its tentative range, and a substantial decline in velocity
would be anticipated, as in 1985 and 1986. This alternative also would
allow room for a reversal of the unexplained portion of weakness in money
growth in 1987. If this were to occur, relatively high rates of money
growth might be needed to promote satisfactory economic performance.
","alternative a"
1988-05-17,12,"(12) The increase in discount borrowing to $600 million under
alternative C would raise the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point and
carry Treasury bill rates up by similar amounts. Banks very likely would
raise the prime rate by another 1/2 point, and business financing costs on
open market paper also could rise by a like amount. Downward pressure on
the exchange value of the dollar would be forestalled, at least for a time.
As is typical, bond yields would go up by less than short-term rates, though
the initial declines in bond and possibly stock prices in response to an
unanticipated firming of the size contemplated under this alternative could
be substantial. Over time, however, movements in securities prices will
depend on perceptions both of underlying strength in credit demands and of
the likely success of the Federal Reserve in checking any emerging accelera-
tion of inflation. While the course of economic activity and prices would
not be much affected by small variations in the time path of interest rates,
alternative C is closer to what was contemplated in the staff GNP forecast,
which anticipates a fairly substantial rise in money market yields through
early 1989.
","alternative C, alternative c, alternative C"
1988-08-16,12,"(12) Under alternative B, average M3 growth over August and
September is projected to stay at its 5-1/2 percent July pace, despite a
pickup in bank and thrift credit. Outflows from institution-only money
funds are expected to follow the recent rise in market rates, and inflows
to Treasury deposits will be holding down needs for managed liabilities.
With credit at depository institutions projected to continue in the fourth
quarter at around the rates of August and September, M3 could grow at close
to a 6 percent rate over the balance of the year, bringing its growth for
the year to around 6-1/2 percent. The debt of domestic nonfinancial sec-
tors is projected to grow at around an 8 percent annual rate over the
remainder of the year, placing it a little below the midpoint of its moni-
toring range by year-end.
","alternative B"
1988-09-20,12,"(12) With markets not now expecting a near-term tightening of
policy, the rise in the federal funds rate under the firmer reserve condi-
tions of alternative C would be about matched by increases in other short-
term rates--perhaps including the prime rate. Bond yields and the dollar
also would back up; the amounts would depend on surrounding circumstances,
but could be considerable if market participants extrapolated a renewed
tightening trend for policy in the context of incoming data suggesting
continued momentum in the economy. Foreign monetary authorities might
follow suit to temper the rise in the dollar. The further rise in oppor-
tunity costs under alternative C would likely damp M2 growth to only a 2
percent rate over the August-to-December period, and its M1 component would
be expected to decline a little. By the end of the year, M2 would be
growing at only a 1 percent rate. M3 growth also would slow from its pace
of recent months, mainly reflecting further weakness in institution-only
money market mutual funds.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1988-11-01,12,"(12) M3 growth is expected to pick up to a 6-1/2 percent rate
over November and December under alternative B, implying quarterly
average growth of 4-1/2 percent in the current quarter and a further
rise in its velocity--at a 2 percent rate. Under this alternative, M3
would begin the year in the upper half of its tentative range. However,
M3 growth might weaken a bit in the early part of 1989 as bank loans to
finance buyouts were repaid or sold to other investors. And, in
general, trend growth in bank and thrift credit should remain damped in
response to capital requirements and regulatory pressures.
","alternative B"
1988-12-13,12,"(12) M3 growth of 7 percent at an annual rate is anticipated from
November to March under alternative B, somewhat above the average of the
last two months. This aggregate should accelerate around year-end, spurred
by massive LBO and merger financing requirements, which will require a sub-
stantial pickup in managed liabilities, including large CDs. However, M3
growth is expected to moderate to around 6-1/2 percent in February and
March, as bank credit growth returns to its former trend. Quarterly aver-
age M3 growth would be associated with a gain of M3 velocity in the first
quarter of about 1-1/2 percent, close to the pace of the previous two
","alternative B"
1989-03-28,12,"(12)- M3 is projected to grow at a 5 percent annual rate over the
March-to-June period under alternative B, somewhat faster than from
December to March. Commercial banks are expected to continue issuing
substantial amounts of large CDs to fund still strong merger-related loan
demands. At thrifts, even if asset growth doesn't pick up, M3 could still
be boosted relative to earlier this year as less weakness in retail
deposits is reflected in reduced reliance on FHLB advances. Contributing
to the pickup in M3 growth would be a resumption of inflows to institu-
tion-only money funds as their returns catch up to market rates. On a
quarterly average basis, M3 would grow at a 5 percent rate, implying an
increase of 2-1/2 percent in its velocity.
","alternative B"
1989-05-16,12,"(12) The easing of the federal funds rate under alternative A
would result in further declines in short-term rates of an additional 1/4
percentage point. With a policy move of this dimension this soon still
unexpected by market participants, it could reinforce the perception that
market rates have peaked, fueling a further rally in fixed-income and
stock markets. On the other hand, if the Federal Reserve were seen in
light of subsequent developments to have moved prematurely, the easing
could rekindle inflation concerns. In any case, some downward pressure on
the exchange value of the dollar would be likely as interest differentials
favoring dollar assets narrowed further.
","alternative A"
1989-10-03,12,"(12) Under alternative B, M3 growth would pick up a bit from its
August and September pace to a 4-1/2 percent rate. In addition to the
slowing of reductions in assets and M3 liabilities at thrifts, bank credit
may strengthen. While banks continue to enjoy relatively favorable core
deposit inflows, banks will need to tap additional managed liabilities to
fund the faster credit growth and replace balances withdrawn by the
Treasury. Banks should continue to make further large acquisitions of
mortgage assets, whose returns are still relatively attractive. More
generally, enlarged issuance of mortgage-backed securities and heightened
activity by sponsored agencies will facilitate the redistribution of
mortgage lending without further significant effects on its cost and
availability. In the business sector, borrowing is expected to remain
around the reduced pace of recent months, despite some dropoff in cor-
porate share retirements owing in part to the higher cost of leveraging.
Although Treasury borrowing also will slacken, this deceleration merely
represents-the movement of RTC financing off budget in the new fiscal
year, rather than a decline in underlying credit demands. In total,
domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to grow at around an 8 percent
annual rate over the fourth quarter, implying similar growth for the year,
a little below the midpoint of its annual monitoring range.
","alternative B"
1989-11-14,12,"(12) Even under the unchanged interest rates of alternative B, M2
growth would remain close to last month's brisk pace, buoyed by recent
declines in market interest rates and opportunity costs. Under this
alternative, M2 is expected to expand at a 7-1/4 percent average annual
rate in November and December; growth from September to December and on a
fourth-quarter average basis would be 7-1/2 percent. This combines with
the staff's nominal GNP projection of 5 percent for the quarter to imply a
model-based forecasts incorporating the recent reductions in opportunity
costs. M1 is projected to slow to a 6-1/4 percent rate in the last two
partial offset, however, inflows to nontransaction retail deposits are
seen as strengthening somewhat this month and next, as the effects of the
recent policy easings take hold.

1989-12-18,12,"(12) Under alternative B, M2 would expand at an 8 percent annual
rate over the November-to-March period, near the pace of recent months.8
Growth would continue to be buoyed by previous declines in market interest
rates, causing a further reduction in the velocity of this aggregate at a
concentrated in its more liquid components, whose opportunity costs have
narrowed the most. Small time deposits could strengthen a little now that
RTC no longer is providing additional funds to replace high-cost deposits.
rency deposits in the United States beginning in January will have much
impact on the monetary aggregates. Such deposits will be excluded from
the aggregates, and the amount of shifting to foreign currency accounts
from dollar deposits in the aggregates is expected to be small.
In these circumstances, intervened thrifts may continue to bid more ag-
gressively to retain or replace maturing brokered deposits, as they have
in recent weeks, prompting other depository institutions to raise their
offering rates. While most of the small time deposits would come from
other M2 sources, some might be diverted from outside M2, given the more
favorable deposit rates. Growth in the M1 component would be expected to
be around 6 percent over the November-to-March period, sustained by in-
flows to OCDs and some augmenting of demand deposits around year-end to
meet compensating balance requirements. By March, M2 would have grown

to moderate to within its tentative annual target cone in the third

1990-03-27,12,"(12) Under alternative B, M2 growth from March to June is pro-
jected at a 6 percent annual rate--about 1/2 percentage point below its
average growth rate over the first three months of the year. Nominal
income growth is projected to slow next quarter. Opportunity costs may
narrow only a little from recently elevated levels. Thrifts are discour-
aging deposit inflows as part of their effort to trim balance sheets; many
of these deposits are going to banks instead, and these deposit shifts
would be augmented as the RTC steps up the rate at which it resolves
institutions. Banks may be unwilling, however, to expand their assets in
line with deposit inflows, given concerns about loan quality and the
capital requirements associated with a pickup in asset growth. In such
circumstances, offering rates on retail deposits are likely to stay some-
what depressed relative to Treasury bill rates. With opportunity costs
little changed, velocity probably will be about flat in the second quar-
ter.3 M1 is expected to continue expanding at a 4-1/2 percent annual
rate from March to June, as a slowing of currency growth is offset by a
little faster inflow to transactions deposits than over the first quar-
","alternative B"
1990-05-15,12,"(12) The tighter reserve conditions under alternative C would be
expected to keep money growth damped. M2 would be at the middle of its
range by June and M3 just above the lower end of its range. Short-term
rates would increase by about the 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal
funds rate, and the dollar would tend to firm. Banks would raise the
prime rate, and could further tighten other credit terms. Bond yields
also would rise, at least initially, in response to the reversal of the
previous trend in Federal Reserve actions. However, in the context of
only moderate growth in the economy, the higher short-term interest rates
and slower money growth would be seen as a policy response to inflation
pressures, implying additional emphasis by the Federal Reserve on its
price stability objective. In this context, the credibility of that
objective could be enhanced, to the benefit of bond prices.

","alternative C"
1990-12-18,12,"(12) Securities markets appear to be anticipating another small
policy adjustment at some point in the coming intermeeting period, though
not necessarily immediately after the meeting. Hence, market interest and
exchange rates would not react much to the unchanged reserve conditions of
alternative B, at least initially. Moreover, expectations of further ease
likely would be sustained if incoming data confirm the markets' impression
of a significant economic downturn. Although borrowers and lenders
already have made substantial adjustments to their portfolios in anticipa-
tion of year-end pressures, strains still could emerge at times in coming
weeks. In January, with the threat of year-end pressures and portfolio
adjustments behind them, banks may reduce the prime rate. Were current
reserve conditions to be maintained through the intermeeting period in the
face of weak economic data, markets might begin to reassess the Federal
Reserve's intentions, and interest and exchange rates might edge higher--
although favorable effects on inflation expectations would work to moder-
ate any such rise in bond rates.

1991-05-14,12,"(12) The current structure of interest rates appears to embody
market expectations of no further monetary policy move in the near term,
so implementation of alternative B is unlikely to engender any immediate
reaction in domestic financial or foreign exchange markets. Over the
intermeeting period, market participants no doubt will encounter mixed
evidence about the outlook, as is typical in a period near a turning
point. With expectations somewhat fragile, there may be frequent adjust-
ments to financial asset prices in the face of these mixed signals.
Markets also may be particularly sensitive to clues about the Federal
Reserve's policy strategy around the cycle trough; the unchanged policy
stance of alternative B--if maintained through the intermeeting period
in the absence of clear evidence of a trough--could be seen as
incorporating a more cautious policy approach to assuring an upturn.

from September to December, producing a similar growth rate on a
quarterly average basis and another decline in M1 velocity in reflec-
tion of the recent drop in its opportunity costs.9  On a quarterly
average basis, a 2-1/4 percent rate of M2 growth would be implied for
the year's final quarter, up from the slight decline posted in the
third quarter. The gain in the velocity of M2 in the fourth quarter--
given the staff's projection of 6 percent growth for nominal GNP--
would be somewhat below the estimated 4-1/2 percent annual rate of
increase in V2 estimated for the third quarter. The implied 3-1/2
percentage point error in the staff's standard econometric model for
M2 growth would be about half the size of the record miss of the third

1991-11-05,12,"(13) M2 is projected to strengthen to a 4 percent rate by
December under alternative A and would be entering the new year well
into its tentative range. Enlarged inflows to liquid deposits would
boost both its nontransactions and M1 components, as sluggish deposit
rates contribute to the attractiveness of such accounts. Tending to
limit the pickup in M2, though, would be declines in rates on retail
CDs and money funds in relation to expected returns on capital market
instruments; also, cost pressures might induce more banks to overcome
their hesitancy to lower rates on passbook and NOW accounts, which
could prompt established customers to reconsider investment options
and move account balances to market instruments.
","alternative A"
1991-12-17,12,"(12) Under alternative A, the 1/2 percentage point fall in the
funds rate to 4 percent would foster a smaller drop in other short-term
interest rates, given the expectations of near-term policy easing al-
ready incorporated in current market quotes. The three-month Treasury
bill rate would probably drop to around 4 percent or a bit below. The
prime rate would be cut by 1/2 percentage point, preserving its current
wide spread over funding costs. Bond yields also probably would decline
immediately, though by less than the drop in short rates. Unless data
were clear-cut in pointing to continuing weakness in the economy, the
half-point easing of alternative A--closely following the quarter-point
decline in the funds rate last week--would be seen as signalling a
priority on encouraging a strong recovery. As a result, any reduction
in inflation expectations would tend to be delayed. The exchange value
of the dollar likely would extend its recent decline. The staff
anticipates only modest decreases in foreign interest rates on average
over coming months, as cost pressures in Germany remain intense and
German interest rates put a floor under rates in other EC countries.

all three alternatives are given in the table below and on the table and

of alternative B, M2 growth is projected to moderate to a 3-1/2 percent
rate from March to June. leaving this aggregate below the midpoint of

will be reversing. One such factor is the shifting of tax refunds
into February from later months. Another involves mortgage refinancing;
such activity already may have leveled out with depressing effects on
growth of demand deposits, and refinancing could well decline
subsequently in response to the rise in mortgage rates, causing
currently swollen demand deposit accounts of mortgage servicers to be
drawn down. The slowdown in M2 over the March-to-June period would be

to continue to be concentrated in savings deposits (including MMDAs),
while sizable outflows from retail time deposits persist.
","alternative B"
1992-08-18,12,"(12) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to resume expanding
this month and to grow at a 2-1/4 percent pace on balance over the
remainder of the year. M2 growth will be supported by large inflows
to demand deposits in the months ahead, owing to the resumption of
strong mortgage refinancing activity and a buildup in compensating
balances occasioned by recent declines in market rates. With
flows into OCDs also strong, Ml is projected to expand at a 10 percent
pace over the balance of the year. Beyond Ml, outflows from M2
money funds are projected to abate, although the very steep yield
curve is expected to continue to draw balances from such accounts and
from retail time deposits to capital market investments. On a quar-
terly average basis, M2 would contract slightly this quarter, and
increase at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. This projec-
tion assumes the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B ex-
tended through year-end and the Greenbook economic forecast. It im-
plies velocity growth at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter
and 3-1/4 percent in the fourth. With the assumed income and interest
rates, standard money demand models predict velocity decreases through
this period; experimental models that embody yield-curve effects and
other alternative measures of opportunity costs are predicting veloc-
ity increases in the second half of the year, though not as large as
embodied in the staff forecast.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1992-10-06,12,"(12) Under alternative B, the staff foresees M3 growth of
August and September. Institution-only money funds have lost the rate
advantage they temporarily enjoyed relative to market instruments
immediately after recent policy easings. Furthermore, the runoffs of
large time deposits at banks as well as thrifts are expected to pick
up again. Bank credit growth is seen as moderating from its pace of
recent months as the unusually rapid pace of security acquisitions
drops off, meaning bank needs for net new financing should abate.
Bank lending terms and standards will probably remain quite restric-
tive, possibly easing only a little, and demands for business and
consumer credit at banks seem likely to remain very subdued.
","alternative B"
1993-08-17,12,"(12) In light of the likelihood of some decline in an array of
real interest rates, as well as the real foreign exchange value of the
dollar, alternative A might be favored if economic growth in the staff
forecast were seen to be unsatisfactory and the Committee were willing
to accept little or no further disinflation. Or this option might
appear attractive if the risks to the staff forecast were seen to be
tilted significantly toward the downside, especially in view of con-
tinued fiscal drag. The lower interest rates of this alternative would
tend to boost money growth relative to alternative B and, under the
spending propensities incorporated in the staff forecast, would give a
little more assurance that the broad aggregates would finish the year at
or above the lower bounds of their ranges for 1993. Faster growth in M2
under alternative A owes both to more growth in nominal income later in
the year than under alternative B and to the improvement in the attrac-
tiveness of assets in M2 relative to money market instruments. However,
the strengthening of M2 would be only modest, because the elasticity of
this aggregate with respect to short-term interest rates now seems to be
quite small. M3 under alternative A would expand slowly over the final
four months of the year as bank credit growth remained damped in the
context of continued heavy financing in the securities markets.

1993-09-21,12,"(12) Under alternative C, interest rates would rise and the
dollar would strengthen on foreign exchange markets. Money market
rates would increase by the full 50 basis point rise in the federal
funds rate. Although markets seem still to expect a tightening in
policy at some point, action under this alternative would come much
sooner than now built into the yield curve. Intermediate-term rates
would increase significantly, especially if the tightening were seen
as signalling a more aggressive posture of the Federal Reserve against
inflation and a higher trajectory of short-term rates for a considera-
ble period. However, lower prospective inflation might decrease far-
ahead forward rates, limiting advances in nominal bond yields.
","alternative C"
1993-11-16,12,"(12) Alternative A contemplates an easing in reserve market
pressures and a decline in the federal funds rate to 2-1/2 percent.13
Implementation of alternative A would be especially surprising to market
participants, given their view that underlying economic growth is
strengthening. Short-term interest rates, including the prime rate,
probably would fall by about the 50 basis point reduction in the federal
funds rate, and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets
likely would decline. In these circumstances, any lasting reduction in
intermediate- and longer-term interest rates likely would be limited by
a belief that the action would need to be reversed before too long, as
well as by perceptions that the Federal Reserve was placing less weight
on containing inflationary pressures and more weight on promoting near-
term growth in output and employment. Issuance of bonds and mortgages
likely would be heavy, as borrowers reacted to a sense that this was the
last window of low long-term rates for quite some time.
","Alternative A, alternative A"
1993-12-21,12,"(12) Alternative C might be preferred if there were concerns
about the inflation outlook. Such concerns could arise from a view
that current-quarter strength in economic activity suggested that the
economy was on an appreciably higher growth track, perhaps because
financial factors damping expansion have faded, allowing the current
accommodative stance of monetary policy to show through more fully
into aggregate demand. In that event, the output gap would be closing
more quickly than in the staff forecast, raising the risks of an
overshooting of activity relative to its potential and hence greater
inflationary pressures over time. A timely firming in policy now
could obviate a more aggressive tightening later to keep inflation
from picking up, involving perhaps even higher real interest rates if
delays permitted inflation expectations to deteriorate.
","Alternative C"
1994-03-22,12,"(12) In addition to possibly contributing to more settled
market conditions, alternative C might be preferred if the Committee
saw significant risks of greater inflation going forward. To fore-
stall this possibility, the Committee may wish to take prompter action
than assumed in the staff forecast. The 50 basis point increase in
the funds rate under this alternative would tend to sustain the backup
in real intermediate- and long-term rates, which may be seen as needed
to restrain inflation pressures, especially in the context of a con-
siderably more accommodative lending posture of intermediaries.
","alternative C"
1994-08-16,12,"(12) The more forceful move of alternative D might be chosen
if the Committee viewed the economic situation as highly likely to
require substantial additional monetary tightening, for example, of the
scope embodied in the steep tilt to the yield curve over the next few
years. Alternatively, the Committee also might take this action if it
believed that only moderate further tightening were required to hold
inflation in check. In this regard, the 50 basis points of alternative
D would imply more assurance of this outcome than alternative C and,
therefore, would be more likely to be followed by a period of stability
of short-term rates. Given these alternative rationales, the Committee
might want to explain its reasoning publicly--an opportunity for which
would naturally occur if the increase were accomplished through a hike
in the discount rate. The market response might depend importantly on
how the action was perceived. If the market saw it as one of a series
of further steps, interest rates could rise substantially along the
maturity spectrum. On the other hand, if markets saw the increase as
the last at least for a time, short-term rates would rise, but inter-
mediate- and possibly long-term rates might move very little. Some
forward rates would be revised down and reductions in expected volatil-
ity might lower risk premiums on longer-term assets.
","alternative C"
1994-11-15,12,"(12) With market participants generally appearing to have
built in a move of at least this size, interest rates could exhibit
little initial reaction to the implementation of alternative C. The
receipt of information on output and price developments over the
intermeeting period along the lines of the relatively robust Greenbook
forecast might reinforce the market's perception that additional
System tightening is required, and interest rates could edge higher
later in the period. The foreign exchange value of the dollar could
remain around recent trading levels if nominal interest rates move
sufficiently higher to offset the effects of a heightened sense of
potential inflationary pressures.
","alternative C"
1994-12-20,12,"(12) Under alternative C, money market interest rates would
firm somewhat, especially those at the shortest end, as the tightening
would come somewhat sooner than now expected. To the degree that
market participants saw such an action as evidence of an even stronger
anti-inflationary resolve of the Committee, nominal forward rates at
intermediate- and longer-term maturities would tend to decline, limit-
ing any increase in longer-term rates. Real interest rates, however,
would rise, bolstering the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
Quality spreads could widen a bit as higher rates increased debt-ser-
vicing burdens and raised questions about the ongoing strength of the
","alternative C"
1995-03-28,12,"(12) The easing in reserve market conditions under alterna-
tive A could be justified if the unexpected weakness in the recent
economic data were read as indicating that previous policy tightenings
risked an unacceptably sharp slowdown in spending later this year--
especially since a real federal funds rate remaining above its longer-
term average might add to the restraint on demand already in the pipe-
line. Concerns in this regard might be accentuated by the further
deterioration in the Mexican situation and repercussions on U.S. net
exports. In this view, with pressures on resources possibly abating
appreciably, the risks of worsening inflation would seem minimal. In
effect, choice of alternative A would imply a view that not only have
longer-term interest and exchange rates not overshot on the downside,
but that policy may still be too tight to allow markets to compensate
fully for oncoming economic weakness.
","alternative A"
1995-05-23,12,"(12) The Committee might consider the easing of monetary
policy under alternative A appropriate if it saw substantial risks
that the recent sluggish growth of final demand and the associated
inventory correction could develop into a prolonged period of growth
below potential. In this view, the declines this year in the dollar
and market interest rates might not be adequate in themselves to sus-
tain the expansion, given underlying trends in aggregate demand. Real
rates could be seen as still too high; for example, the 6 percent
funds rate implies short-term real rates above longer-term averages,
assuming inflation settles down at 3 percent as in the staff forecast.
Committee members might have particular concerns about the level of
real rates if they perceived strong odds of a significantly tighter
stance of fiscal policy than is incorporated in the staff forecast.
Such a policy shift would lower ""equilibrium"" real interest rates by
directly reducing government spending and, perhaps, by increasing
private saving propensities. Markets do not currently appear to have
built in a trajectory to a balanced budget and would probably respond
to credible measures to reach this target by bidding down longer-term
yields. These declines would, by themselves, help to bolster activity
in the near term. To cushion the fiscal restraint adequately, how-
ever, declines in long-term rates might need to be reinforced through
an easing in monetary policy.
","alternative A"
1995-08-22,12,"(12) The choice of the higher rates of alternative C would
seem to rest on concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook. As
and, with no slack in the economy at the end of the forecast period,
would not be expected to decline appreciably in 1997. If the Commit-
tee were intent on making measurable progress toward price stability
in the next several years, a rise in the real federal funds rate from
its current level would seem to be needed based on the relationships
embodied in the staff forecast. To be sure, unexpected developments
could reduce inflation pressures, perhaps by putting slack in the
economy, but there can be no assurance of such a surprise on either
the supply or demand sides. The need for a tightening of policy -
reestablish a disinflationary trend might seem all the more pressing
if the firmer spending data of late and the brisk pace of broad money
growth, with the economy already producing around its potential, were
seen as suggesting risks on the side of more inflation than in the
staff forecast.
","alternative C"
1995-09-26,12,"(12) If the Committee saw reasonably high odds of more
restrictive effects on the economy than the staff forecast, it might
favor an easing of the funds rate, as under alternative A. Such
effects would come at a time when the economy already is expected to
be expanding at a rate less than the growth rate of its potential and
with monetary policy possibly seen as also on the restrictive side.
In July, the Committee reversed only a portion of the move toward
policy restraint it made last winter when the risks to the economy of
rising inflation were much larger. Real rates across the maturity
spectrum remain elevated by historical standards, though, to be sure,
the level of equilibrium real rates is uncertain. Moreover, real
rates could move up a little further over time with an unchanged funds
rate, as current expectations of a policy ease were frustrated.
","alternative A"
1995-11-15,12,"(12) The cut in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points
under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than now expected
in the market. Consequently, it would show through to other money
market interest rates, and banks would trim 1/2 percentage point off
the prime rate. The dollar would be expected to weaken on foreign
exchange markets as interest rates on dollar-denominated assets fell
in relation to those on other major currencies. The sustainability of
any decline in bond rates would depend on whether market participants
similarly saw the easing to be called for or rather viewed it to be
premature and unsustainable, as might become the case if indicators in
the period just ahead were broadly in line with the staff forecast.
","alternative A"
1995-12-19,12,"(12) Under the staff forecast, alternative A would risk
fostering greater inflation pressures, and the move would eventually
need to be reversed. Thus, choice by the Committee of this alterna-
tive would presumably be based on an assessment that aggregate demand
is more likely to flag than under the staff forecast and that infla-
tion and inflation expectations are more likely to decline. Optimism
on inflation might be based on the observation that inflation has come
in lower than expected at mid-year and inflation expectations have
abated significantly. As a consequence, real short-term rates are
perhaps higher than the Committee had anticipated when it established
the 5-3/4 percent funds rate. The good performance of the economy in
the face of these real short-term rates may be seen as reflecting in
part the rally in capital markets, which, however, has been based to a
degree on expectations of policy ease. In the absence of policy
action, real longer-term interest rates and exchange rates would be
pushed higher, and an easing could be based on concern that these
higher real rates risked an unduly sluggish economy in the future.
Indeed, the favorable inflation-output mix of the second half of 1995
might be seen as indicating that the economy is capable of operating
on a sustained basis at a higher level of output and hence lower
levels of real interest rates than in the staff forecast.
","alternative A"
1996-03-26,12,"(12) A 1/2 percentage point tightening in reserve conditions,
as under alternative C, might be favored if the Committee agreed with
the staff forecast but viewed its outcome for inflation as undesir-
able, particularly if the Committee wanted to make some progress to-
ward price stability. Indeed, given that the economy is already
operating at or beyond many estimates of its potential, the Committee
might see significant upside risks to the inflation forecast. In this
regard, the recent behavior of asset prices and some financial ag-
gregates could potentially be signalling inflationary pressures. Part
of the rise in bond yields might be associated with higher inflation
expectations, and the gains in equity markets have the potential to
provide excessive stimulus to spending. Moreover, the broad monetary
aggregates have been growing rapidly of late, suggesting ample li-
quidity in household balance sheets and readily available funds for
depositories. Relative to the staff forecast, a 1/2 percentage point
firming in reserve conditions would take a little pressure off re-
source markets, raising the odds that the inflation rate would not
tend to drift higher.
","alternative C"
1996-05-21,12,"(12) The interest rates of alternative B and associated
staff forecast for the economy are thought to be consistent with a
slight moderation in the growth of money and credit over coming months
relative to their pace of expansion so far in 1996. (Projected growth
for April to September and from the fourth quarter to September are
shown in the table below.) The staff anticipates that the terms and
conditions of bank lending will remain on the accommodative side,
though perhaps continuing to firm a little for consumer credit. Only
partly as a consequence, growth of consumer credit is projected to
continue its downtrend, accompanied by sustained moderate expansion of
home mortgage debt. Business borrowing may edge off as the recent
rise in long-term yields continues to restrain bond issuance, while
subdued inventory investment keeps the lid on bank loans and commer-
cial paper. Near-term borrowing by the federal government is now
shaping up as rather weak in light of the build-up in the Treasury's
cash balance stemming from outsized individual tax payments in April.
As a result of the downward-revised forecast for federal debt growth,
the expansion of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt from April to

September is now projected at only a 4-1/2 percent pace, leaving its
level in September somewhat below the 5 percent midpoint of its annual
growth rate range.
","alternative B"
1996-12-17,12,"(12) A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate (alternative A) would
seem to require a judgment that the upward pressure on prices is less than in the staff
forecast at current interest rate levels. For example, the staff might have underesti-
mated the extent to which forces such as job insecurity are pulling down the natural
rate of unemployment. If so, lower short rates might be consistent with the same
inflation outlook. Essentially, policy easing would reflect the implied drop in the
equilibrium natural real rate of interest and the narrower output gap and reduced price
pressures associated with higher potential. In addition, the extraordinary slowing in
consumer credit growth could be interpreted as indicating a developing problem in
credit markets that will have greater implications for consumer spending than the staff
has allowed, despite the recent uptrend in retail sales and favorable anecdotal reports
on Christmas spending.
","alternative A"
1997-03-25,12,"(12) Under alternative B and the staff forecast, debt is expected to continue to grow
around its recent pace in the months ahead, while money growth tends to moderate as the
expansion of nominal GDP slows. The debt of nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at a
borrowing picks up somewhat, as capital spending remains strong, while flows of internal
funds level out. For households, although credit is likely to become somewhat harder to
obtain for marginal borrowers, overall consumer debt should remain on its recent moderate
growth path.
","alternative B"
1997-11-12,12,"(12) The staff anticipates that, under alternative B, M2 and M3 will grow at annual
rates of 4-1/2 and 6-1/4 percent, respectively, over the five months from October to March of next
year. Over the fourth and first quarters, quarterly average growth rates for the two aggregates
of 5-1/4 and 7-1/4 percent are anticipated, compared with a Greenbook forecast of 5-1/4 percent on
average for nominal GDP. The standard measure of the opportunity costs of holding
monetary assets is effectively unchanged over the next two quarters as the policy tightening
assumed by the staff starts toward the end of that interval. The updrift in M2 velocity
observed in the last few years should be muted in the period ahead, because some investors
will likely choose the safety of M2 assets over increased exposures in equity markets. The
sizable downtrend in M3 velocity is expected to persist. Bank credit is expected to expand at
around a 6 percent rate over the five months, supported in part by strong business lending to
help finance continued investment in plant and equipment, so M3 growth likely again will be
bolstered relative to that of M2 by still-rapid issuance of large time deposits as well as by
inflows into institution-only money funds. For this year as a whole, M2 is seen as growing at
the 5 percent upper end of its range, while M3 is expected to expand 2 percentage points
faster than the 6 percent upper bound of its range.
","alternative B"
1998-03-31,12,"(12) Alternative C would tend to be favored to the extent that the Committee saw
the risks as more heavily weighted toward a pickup in inflation. Data becoming available
since the last meeting have suggested considerable economic strength and a tighter labor
market. The attractive conditions in financing markets, the exceptionally high level of stock
valuations, and rapid growth in money and debt may be viewed as corroborating the strong
financial thrust in the economy, which would support domestic demand going forward. These
factors have led the staff to revise up its own inflation forecast. While Committee members
may have anticipated some of this strength in demand over the intermeeting period, enough
may have been a surprise so as to elevate or validate concerns about the prospects for a
pickup in inflation. With the unemployment rate already likely below its sustainable level,
this additional demand could lead to a steeper upward track for underlying inflation that
would require more substantial and disruptive restraint the longer it is delayed.
","Alternative C"
1998-08-18,12,"(12) M2 and M3 are forecast to expand at 5 and 7-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively,
from July to December under alternative B. The moderation in money reflects the expectation of
slightly slower growth in nominal GDP over the second half of the year. In addition, the staff
expects a less-rapid decline in M2 velocity in the second half, in part because the expansion of
mortgage refinancing activity, which had boosted M2 growth over the first half of the year,
comes to a halt. Bank credit is projected to rise less rapidly in the second half of the year than in
the first, reflecting a slowing pace of securities acquisitions as well as some moderation in loan
growth, damping banks' needs for funding through M3-type instruments. Despite the slowing in
M2 and M3 growth during the second half, both aggregates are expected to overshoot their
annual ranges for the year as a whole.3

Directive Language
","alternative B"
1998-12-22,12,"(12) The choice of the quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C
would seem to rest on the judgment that the inflation outcome in the staff forecast is
unacceptable or that there are significant risks of a more substantial pickup in inflation. In the
staff forecast, core CPI inflation persists above 2 percent, and many other measures of inflation
notch higher. The Committee may believe that a worse inflationary scenario is plausible because
the economy continues to operate beyond its long-run potential, incoming data show that
aggregate demand has considerable momentum, and financial conditions in general may now be
too accommodative. The resilience of equity prices in the face of continued earnings
disappointments could suggest the possibility that the stock market will remain a positive
influence on demand, in contrast to the drag anticipated in the staff forecast. Although spreads
remain wide in the bond market, the absolute cost of credit, averaging across quality classes, is
little changed from early summer, when the Committee was concerned about inflation pressures.
Moreover, the cost of funds is down substantially for borrowers from banks as well as in the
commercial paper market owing to the monetary policy easings. And after the turn of the year,
markets might become even more attractive to private borrowers. In addition, the foreign
exchange value of the dollar against the major currencies has fallen 6 percent since mid-July.
Finally, the surprise easing of monetary policy in continental Europe may indicate an increased
willingness there to respond to signs of demand weakness, which would facilitate easing in other
countries and reduce the risk of a slackening in global economic activity.
","alternative C"
1999-11-16,12,"(12) The choice of the 1/4 percentage point rise in the funds rate under alternative
C may incline the Committee to return to a symmetric directive. An unbiased directive
could convey a sense that policy makers thought they might have put sufficient cumulative
restraint in place to check inflation or, at least, to buy some time to assess whether
additional firming was needed. Alternatively, the Committee may decide to retain an
asymmetric directive in order to transmit its impression that, despite the higher 5-1/2
percent funds rate, the risks over a longer time period would still be tilted in the direction of
heightened inflation pressures. If the Committee wanted to be sure that market
uncertainties about near-term policy action did not unduly contribute to strains in the runup
to year end, the announcement could convey a disinclination to act in December.
","alternative
C"
1999-12-21,12,"(12) Assuming the selection of alternative B and no significantly untoward
developments over year-end, some further abatement of the unusual risk aversion and
demand for liquidity currently evident in markets should be apparent over the first few
weeks of 2000. Risks spreads could narrow somewhat, but they should remain wider, and
other credit terms tighter, than in the period before the market disruptions in the summer
and fall of 1998. Measured from October to March, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is
expected to expand at a 5-1/2 percent pace, roughly in line with nominal income, placing
this aggregate in March in the upper half of its 3 to 7 percent provisional range.
","alternative B"
2000-03-21,12,"(12) The monetary aggregates are projected to accelerate a little from their growth
rates early this year, when they were depressed by the unwinding of Y2K effects.
Nonetheless, expansion of the aggregates, particularly M2, should be restrained by the
influence of earlier policy tightenings, even under the unchanged federal funds rate of
alternative B. Growth rates of M2 in coming months are likely to be erratic, owing to the
effects of the shifting timing of tax refunds and the likely surge in payments, but on average
this aggregate is projected to expand at a rate of 6-1/4 percent over the February-to-June
period under alternative B. With nominal GDP expanding faster than M2, M2 velocity
would increase at a 1-3/4 percent pace in both the first and the second quarters. By June,
M2 would be 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter 1999 base, somewhat
above the upper end of its annual range. Buoyed by rapid bank credit growth, expansion of
M3 is projected at an 8 percent rate over the February-to-June period, keeping this aggregate
well above the upper end of its annual range. Indeed, by June, M3 would be 8 percent at an
annual rate above its fourth-quarter base, compared with the 6 percent upper end of its
","alternative B, alternative B"
2000-11-15,12,"(12) If the Committee believes that economic growth likely will remain below that
of its potential at the current funds rate, along the lines of the staff forecast, but thinks that
the existing level of resource use may be sustainable, then it might choose the 25 basis point
easing of alternative A in order to forestall an unnecessary rise in the unemployment rate.
The argument for this policy choice would be stronger if the Committee put significant
weight on the possibility that aggregate demand would prove weaker than in the staff
forecast. Such an eventuality could occur if softer economic performance leads to further
deterioration of financial conditions and more cautious spending behavior by households
and businesses.
","alternative A"
2000-12-19,12,"(12) With no policy move expected at this meeting, adoption of alternative A
would presumably trigger a rally in bond and stock markets and a decline in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar. The size of the resulting moves in asset markets
would depend on the accompanying statement of the balance of risks. If the
Committee announced that it believed risks to be in balance, investors could well
interpret the easing as the Committee ""buying insurance"" against a possible further
weakening of growth. Such an action would probably be viewed as mostly bringing
forward in time policy actions that market participants already anticipate, but the
effects in financial markets still would be substantial. An even larger effect could be
expected if the Committee instead announced that risks appeared to be weighted
toward economic weakness, as investors came to expect a greater cumulative easing of
","alternative A"
2001-08-21,12,"(12) Choice of a 50 basis point easing action might follow from the concern
that more economic weakness could well be in  train than pro jected in the G reenbook.
Although consumption has held  up remarkably well so far, an abrupt softening in
consumer spending is not implausible given the prospect of a sharp rise in the
unemployment rate and already relatively high debt burdens.  Moreover, foreign
economic activity could well disappoint for a variety of reasons, including deepening
crises in certain emerging market economies or additional slowing in the pace of
activity in some major industrial economies.  Such eventualities would tend to prolong
both the inventory liquidation and the decline in capital spending, which would
translate into a decline in the equilibrium real funds rate.  Although the level of the
real funds rate implied by the 3¼ percent nominal funds rate of this alternative and
prevailing inflation  expectations would be appreciably below that which is sustainable
in the long run, a rapid policy reversal along the lines of that currently embedded in
futures market prices could be undertaken once information finally starts to signal
convincingly that more solid economic growth has taken hold.
","alternative a"
2003-12-09,12,"(12) In the balance of risks paragraph, there would appear to be two
plausible settings for the assessment of the risks to the outlook for economic growth
and two for the risks to the attainment of price stability over the next few quarters.
Risks to growth might now be seen as balanced or weighted to the upside, and risks to
inflation might now be viewed as weighted to the downside or balanced.  Table 1
displays several possibilities for the overall assessment of risks given alternative
characterizations of the individual risks.

","alternative
c, Alternative A"
2004-03-16,12,"(12) Given this assessment, the Committee might wish to issue a statement
structured like that in Alternative C.  The Committee could convey some sense of
increased wariness about inflation pressures in the final sentence of the rationale
paragraph by noting simply that To date, increases in core consumer prices have been muted and
inflation expectations remain contained, eliminating the forward-looking phrase and are
expected to remain low that appeared in the January statement.  This tone could be
reinforced by modest revisions in the balance-of-risks assessment.  For example, the
Committee could indicate a slight change in its inflation outlook by stating that the
probability of a rise in inflation about equals that of an unwelcome decline in inflation.  Lastly,
while the Committee may not be prepared at this meeting to dispense with references
to patience, it might wish to add a sentence that hints that its patience is not
unlimited.  This could be accomplished with an insertion so that the revised passage
read, The Committee recognizes that the stance of monetary policy has been quite accommodative for
some time.  Nonetheless, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can
still be patient in removing its policy accommodation.  Market participants would be quick to
notice these revisions and, in all likelihood, would interpret the changes as further steps
aimed at clearing the way for an eventual return of the target federal funds rate to a
more neutral setting.  Interest rates likely would move up on that reading, resulting in a
concomitant dip in stock prices, but the retention of some reference to patience would
likely diminish the odds of an outsized market reaction.

points to 1¼ percent.  Alternative C would boost the funds rate by 50 basis points to
1½ percent.  In these alternatives, the Committee could update its description of the
current situation in part by indicating more definitively than previously that hiring has
picked up and by characterizing recent inflation developments according to its
interpretation of recent events.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative C"
2004-08-10,12,"(12) If the Committee is concerned by the slow pace of progress in reducing
resource slack projected in the Greenbook or is worried that the forecasted rebound
in growth could fail to materialize, it may prefer the unchanged policy stance of
Alternative A.  The sluggish consumption spending of late and the still-limited pickup
in capital investmenteven ahead of the expiration of the partial-expensing tax
provisions at year-endmight be read by policymakers as suggesting that aggregate
demand could remain soft for some time.  Such concerns about prospects for
economic activity could intensify if the labor market report for July turns out to be
surprisingly weak.  The possibility that business and consumer confidence could be
impaired by heightened terrorist threats might also be seen as posing some downside
risk to spending and output.  With inflation apparently moving down somewhat from
its elevated levels of earlier this year and inflation expectations apparently contained, a
brief hiatus in the process of firming policy might involve little risk of higher inflation
and would permit the accumulation of additional data that could be helpful in
assessing whether spending is rebounding in line with projections.
","Alternative A"
2004-09-21,12,"(12) In announcing Alternative A, the Committee might wish to state that
Even though output appears to have regained some traction after moderating earlier this year, the
pace of improvement in labor market conditions remains modest.  This wording is broadly
similar to that proposed for Alternative B but puts more stress on the limited
improvement in labor market conditions and less stress on energy price movements as
the source of earlier economic weakness.  As part of the rationale for leaving rates
unchanged, the Committee could employ the language for describing inflation
developments that is proposed for Alternative B, that is, Despite the rise in energy prices,
inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.  Even if the Committee found
good reason to pause in its process of firming policy, it might still perceive the risks to
both growth and inflation as balanced.  In addition, if the Committee viewed the
hiatus as consistent with an intention to move policy over time toward a more neutral
stance, rather than representing a fundamental reappraisal of policy strategy, it might
repeat the judgment that policy could be firmed at a measured pace.  Lastly, the
Committee might wish to indicate under this alternative that future policy adjustments
will depend on prospects for sustainable growth as well as for price stability.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2004-11-10,12,"(12) Against the backdrop of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar, the
Committee might believe that inflation pressures under the Greenbook policy
assumption are unlikely to be as well-contained as in the staff forecast.  Indeed, both
market- and survey-based measures of near-term inflation expectations moved higher
over the intermeeting period.  Faced with these developments, the Committee might
wish to tighten policy a quarter-point and adopt the firmer statement language shown
for Alternative C.  Even if the Committee found the staff forecast of a gradual
decline in inflation to be both likely and generally acceptable as a modal assessment, it
might be concerned about upside risks to the outlook.  In particular, as discussed in
the more inflation scenario in the Greenbook, inflation could pick up markedly if
the rise in oil prices were to trigger a significant increase in long-term inflation
expectations.  Moreover, the Committee might harbor some concerns that inflation
pressures could build ifas envisioned in the slower productivity Greenbook
simulationthe favorable productivity growth trends witnessed in recent years fade
over time.  In such circumstances, policy might need to be tightened relatively briskly
at coming meetings, perhaps inclining the Committee to be reluctant to hint now that
it might pause in the process of firming.
","Alternative C"
2004-12-14,12,"(12)     Market participants have essentially priced in a 25-basis-point rise in the
federal funds target at this meeting and anticipate only relatively small changes in the
statement.  As a result, an announcement like that in Alternative C would likely have
little effect on financial markets.  However, a statement that included a reference to
possible inflation pressures would presumably lead investors to boost their expected
path for the federal funds rate, increasing real and nominal interest rates and weighing
on stock prices.  Such a statement would also likely raise the sensitivity of market
participants to inflation news over the intermeeting period.
","Alternative C"
2005-03-22,12,"(12) According to the Desks survey of primary dealers and anecdotal reports,
market participants universally anticipate a quarter-point firming in policy at this
meeting and generally expect only relatively minor changes to the statement language.
As a result, it seems likely that the market reaction to Alternative B would be fairly
muted.  However, investors would take note of the reference to the pickup of
inflation pressures and would conclude that the Committee believed that appropriate
policy would most likely entail more policy firming than previously expected.
Consequently, yields would probably tick up a few basis points following the
announcement while stock prices could fall back a bit.
","Alternative B"
2005-05-03,12,"(12) The draft statement associated with Alternative B updates the wording of
the March release in light of recent information on spending, employment, and
inflation.  As shown in Table 1, the Committee could indicate that Recent data
suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in
response to the earlier increases in energy prices.  Labor market conditions,
however, apparently continue to improve gradually.  In view of the elevated CPI
figures for the past couple of months, and more generally in recognition of
increased uncertainty about the interpretation of recent inflation news, the draft
wording for Alternative B also suggests that the Committee omit the view expressed
in March that the rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to
core consumer prices.  (The Committees consideration of such a change, however,
could depend on the March reading on PCE prices, which will be released on the
Friday before the meeting.)  If the Committee drops that sentence, it might wish to
reverse the order of the thoughts in the first sentence on inflation that appeared in

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a models projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core PCE 
price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection 
used for the current quarter.  Since TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, the TIPS-consistent 
measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between CPI inflation and core PCE 
inflation.
Measure Description
Single-Equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date reflects the 
short-term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years. This forward rate is 
adjusted down for a term premium, assumed to be 70 basis points, and adjusted up for the 
difference between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation, projected to be 40 basis 
points in the medium run.

the March announcement to avoid communicating an excessively pessimistic view
of inflation prospects.  Apart from such updating, the announcement could be
similar to the one issued after the March meeting.  In particular, it would seem
assuming that members share an economic outlook broadly in line with that of the
staffthat the Committee could retain its assessment of balanced risks to both
sustainable growth and price stability under the assumption of appropriate
monetary policy action that it adopted in March as well as its judgment that
removal of policy accommodation can proceed at a measured pace.4
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
2005-06-29,12,"(12) Table 1 presents three short-run policy alternatives for consideration by the
Committee.  Under Alternatives A and B, the federal funds rate would be boosted
another 25 basis points at this meeting.  Apart from updating the description of the
current economic situation, the announcement associated with Alternative B is little
changed from that issued after the May meeting.  The announcement accompanying
Alternative A would indicate that policy accommodation had been substantially
reduced and would hint at less tightening going forward.  Under Alternative C, the
Committee would raise the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, eliminate
all forward-looking language, and make other significant changes to the
announcement.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining policy action and
draft language from more than one alternative or view some of the language choices
as foreshadowing the future direction of its statement.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative C"
2005-08-09,12,"(12) Investors appear virtually certain that the FOMC will increase the target
federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, and they reportedly put high odds
on an announcement that retains both the measured pace language and the
assessment that the risks to sustainable growth and to price stability should remain
balanced with appropriate policy action.  Thus, the market reaction to an
announcement along the lines of Alternative B should be relatively modest, although
rates could back up a little in response to the changes in the wording suggesting that
the FOMC was focusing on the strength in spending and inflation pressures.  Barring
significant downside surprises in economic data over coming weeks, investors would
likely come to boost further the already substantial odds placed on additional policy
moves later this year, particularly should public statements by policymakers point to a
continuation of firming.
","Alternative B"
2005-11-01,12,"(12) Futures market quotes suggest that investors are virtually certain of a
dealers expect little change in the nature of the statement.  Therefore, market prices
would likely be essentially unaffected by a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate and
the statement language as under Alternative B.
","Alternative B"
2005-12-13,12,"(12) The rationale portion of the statement for Alternative B notes that the
expansion in economic activity appears solid despite elevated energy prices and
disruptions related to the hurricanes.  The reference to policy accommodation has
been dropped:  If the federal funds rate is seen as nearing its equilibrium value, the
Committee may no longer wish to suggest that policy accommodation is boosting
growth.  Members may also want to take this opportunity to remove the reference to
the support to economic activity provided by robust underlying growth in
productivity.  In assessing inflation, the Committee may want to acknowledge the
relatively benign core inflation readings in recent months and again indicate that
longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.  However, given the apparent
underlying strength of aggregate demand, members may want to note that possible
increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to
add to inflation pressures.
","Alternative B"
2006-03-27,12,"(12) Investors are virtually certain of a 25-basis-point rate hike at this meeting
and place quite high odds on another such move in May.  Selection of Alternative B
would probably confirm those expectations, sparking only a limited market reaction.
Short-term interest rates would likely change little immediately after the
announcement.  Market participants of late seem to be looking to policymakers for
clues as to when the tightening cycle will end.  Expectations of a rate hike at the May
meeting will probably increase over the course of the upcoming intermeeting period
in the absence of guidance from policymakers.
","Alternative B"
2006-05-10,12,"(12) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A,
the Committee leaves the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  It also
indicates a best guess that, if any adjustment to the stance of policy subsequently
proved necessary, it likely would be upward.  Under Alternative B, the target for the
federal funds rate is raised another 25 basis points at this meeting, and the risk
assessment suggests that the Committee may pause in June.  Under Alternative C, the
target for the funds rate is raised 50 basis points and the risks are described as
balanced without mention of additional policy action.  All three alternatives provide a
fuller description of the rationale for policy action and some forward-looking
language about the economic outlook.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2006-06-28,12,"(12) Chart 7 depicts the consequences of alternative choices regarding the
relative weights assigned to the three policy objectives.  The solid lines replicate those
of Chart 5, in which policymakers have an inflation goal of 1½ percent and place
equal weights on the objectives.  A potentially unattractive implication of this
specification is that attainment of the inflation objective is a long time coming, with
actual inflation at the end of the decade still nearly ½ percentage point above the goal.
The alternative scenario (dashed lines) depicts the outcome when policymakers place
greater emphasis on the inflation objective, perhaps because of concernsnot
explicitly considered in the modelthat a persistent deviation of inflation from its
goal could damage the Federal Reserves credibility.5  In this case, the federal funds
rate climbs more steeply to 6 percent by the end of next year.  This policy generates
higher real interest rates that damp real activity more than under the baseline policy; as
a result, the unemployment rate rises above 5½ percent late next year and remains
above that level through 2010.  With this additional economic slack, actual inflation
exhibits a more distinct downward trajectory and approaches the long-run goal by the
end of the decade.

2006-08-08,12,"(12) Although recent rates of inflation, if sustained, would presumably be judged
inconsistent with the maintenance of price stability, the Committee might see the
current stance of policy as likely to be sufficient to put core inflation on a downward
track.  If so, it might be inclined to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at
firming might prove necessary, as in Alternative B.  The Committee may agree with
the staff assessment that core inflation is likely to decline gradually in coming quarters
as the forces that have temporarily boosted inflation begin to unwind and the
moderation in economic growth fosters an easing of resource pressures.  Maintaining

the current policy stance would be consistent with prescriptions from the estimated
forecast-based policy rule (Chart 5) as well as the first-difference rule with a long-run
inflation objective of 2 percent (Chart 6).  (See the box Intercept Shifts in Empirical
Taylor Rules.)  A pause at this meeting, after seventeen consecutive actions, might be
seen as desirable in order to limit the risk of over-tightening and the adverse
consequences for employment and growth.  With the real federal funds rate in the
range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium value (Chart 8), the risk that
deferring action for a brief time might significantly worsen underlying inflationary
trends would seem to be modest.  Nonetheless, the Committee may feel that elevated
energy  and commodity prices, possible further increases in these prices, and high
levels of resource utilization imply that the upside risks to inflation remain substantial
and perceive only limited downside risks to the economic expansion, and so see
Intercept Shifts in Empirical Policy Rules 
 
Chart 5 shows the projections of two empirical policy rulesspecified in terms of 
either outcomes or forecasts of the output gap and core inflationthat have been 
estimated using quarterly data from 1988Q1 to 2005Q4.  In previous Bluebooks,  
both of these rules involved a time-invariant intercept, essentially implying that  
the medium-run equilibrium real rate (r*) and the implicit inflation objective (*) 
remained constant throughout the sample period.  However, recent staff analysis 
indicates that a significant upward shift in the intercept of each empirical rule 
occurred in the late 1990s.  Such a shift could arise from either a 75 basis point  
rise in r*, a 1 percentage point decline in *, or some combination of the two.   
The funds rate projections and confidence intervals shown in Chart 5 incorporate 
these intercept shifts.  The projections generated by the forecast-based rule are 
broadly similar to the expectations of market participants, while the outcome-based 
rule points to some additional firming.   
 
Reflecting the possibility of an upward shift in the value of r*, this Bluebook 
introduces an additional simple policy rule in Chart 6.  For each specified value  
of * (either 1½ or 2 percent), the new rule follows Taylor (1999) with respect  
to the policy coefficientswhich determine the responsiveness of the funds rate  
to movements in the output gap and core inflationbut specifies the value of r*  
at 2.75 percent instead of 2 percent.

Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarters prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Except for backward-looking rules, it should be noted that prescriptions near the end of the Greenbook 
horizon also depend on extended baselines. 
  
Estimated Rules:  Estimation is performed using real-time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4, and the 
specifications are chosen according to the Bayesian information criterion.  Each rule incorporates a 75 
basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point increments that occurred 
during the first three quarters of 1998. Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are 
based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model.  The following table indicates the specification of

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding models projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staffs estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.
Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

additional firming as more likely than easing in coming months.  The Committee may
find communicating this posture particularly important if it were concerned that
inaction at this meeting might lead investors to question its vigilance against inflation.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2006-09-20,12,"(12) The rationale wording for Alternative B could note that the moderation in
economic growth appears to be continuing.  In view of recent information on the
residential construction sector, it could indicate that the housing market is cooling,
rather than referring to a gradual cooling as in the August statement.  The
paragraph on inflation could be generally similar to the one in the previous statement.
However, to acknowledge that the most recent data on core inflation were lower than
those in preceding monthsbut not to be seen as overly optimistic in that regard
the statement could indicate that core inflation readings have been elevated on
balance over recent months.  The Committee might also wish to explain more
explicitly its expectation that inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time by
citing a reduced impetus from energy prices.
","Alternative B"
2006-12-12,12,"(12) In light of the recent data and the revision to the staffs projection for near-
term growth, the Committee may wish to make two changes to the discussion of
economic growth in the policy statement accompanying Alternative B.  First, the
extent of the decline in housing activity in recent quarters means that it may now be
more appropriate to refer to the cooling of the housing market as substantial.
Second, the statement could acknowledge that the recent pace of growth appears to
have been somewhat more subdued than anticipated  Even so, the Committee
could note that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance
over coming quarters.  The inclusion of the phrase on balance allows for the
possibility that measured GDP growth in the current and subsequent quarter may be
notably below trend before rebounding thereafter.  With the prospects for inflation
largely unchanged, there appears to be little reason to alter the inflation paragraph
from that in the October statement.  Likewise, the statement could conclude by
repeating the risk assessment from the previous statement.

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers

The economy seems most likely to 
expand at a moderate pace over 
coming quarters.  But weakness in 
housing and capital spending imply a 
significant risk that economic activity 
might grow more slowly than 
anticipated.
Economic growth slowed in the first 
part of this year and the adjustment in 
the housing sector is ongoing.  
Nevertheless, the economy seems 
likely to expand at a moderate pace 
over coming quarters.
Despite the ongoing adjustment in 
the housing sector, the economy 
seems likely to expand at a 
moderate pace over coming 
quarters.
Rationale 
3. Recent readings on core inflation
have been somewhat elevated.  
Although inflation pressures seem 
likely to moderate over time, the 
high level of resource utilization has 
the potential to sustain those 
pressures.
Core inflation remains somewhat 
elevated on balance.  Although the 
high level of resource utilization has 
the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures, those pressures seem likely 
to moderate over time.
Core inflation remains somewhat

Core inflation remains somewhat 
elevated on balance.  Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, but considerable 
uncertainty surrounds that 
judgment.  Moreover, the high level 
of resource utilization, in 
combination with the recent 
increases in energy and other 
commodity prices, has the potential 
to sustain those pressures.
Assessment 
of Risk
In these circumstances, future policy 
adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.
Even after this action, the 
Committees predominant policy 
concern remains the risk that 
inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy 
adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 36
moderate pace no longer seems appropriate.  Moreover, given the dip in core
inflation in March, the reference in the previous statement to recent inflation readings
being elevated has been replaced with the more general observation that core
inflation remains somewhat elevated on balance.  The formulation used in the March
risk assessment that future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the
outlook for both inflation and economic growth is retained in all three alternatives.
With the April employment report to be released on Friday, after the Bluebook closes,
the wording of the draft statements should be viewed as more tentative than usual,
and there is always the opportunity to combine rows from the different columns of
the table.

1969-11-25,13,"(13) If the Committee should decide to move toward slightly
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider the following
second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to
achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank

1971-03-09,13,"(13) An effort to move onto growth paths for aggregates in the
second quarter slower than shown for alternative A--given staff assumptions
as to the strength of economic recovery and attendent credit demands--seems
likely to require a rise in the Federal funds rate from current levels during
the next four weeks. The money market conditions now estimated to be con-
sistent with alternative A through C are shown in the table below, using the
second quarter annual rate of growth in M1 as a convenient index of the col-
lection of monetary aggregates. Difference in money market conditions of these
dimensions would be expected to have only relatively minor effects on growth
rates for the aggregates in March.

","alternative A, alternative A, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1971-04-06,13,"(13) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides to retain the form of the present directive,
involving a primary instruction concerned with money market conditions
and long-term interest rates and a proviso clause relating to the aggre-
""To implement this policy, System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining prevailing money
market conditions while accommodating any downward move-
ments in long-term rates; provided that money market con-
ditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary
and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from
the growth paths expected, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTH-
COMING TREASURY FINANCING.""
With respect to the proposed reference to the forthcoming Treasury financ-
ing (in this and the other alternatives) the Treasury's announcement is
expected on April 28, as indicated in paragraph (11) above. If the
Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money market
conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (6) as a description of
""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause, to adopt
the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alterna-
tive A as the ""expected"" paths. The Committee could also specify a slow-
er growth path for purposes of the proviso, the effect of which would be to
activate the proviso sooner if the staff projections prove to be correct.
Or, if the Committee so desires, it could use a directive with a structure
similar to alternative A but with the specifications for money market con-
ditions and aggregates given above in connection with alternative B or C.
In such a case, the language preceding the proviso clause might be modified
to call for ""attaining firmer money market conditions;"".
","Alternative A, alternative A, alternative A, alternative B"
1971-06-08,13,"(13) Under all three alternatives, growth in M2 is expected to
slow more than growth in M1 between the second and third quarters. Time and
savings deposits other than large CD's are growing less rapidly in the second
than the first quarter, although the slowing thus far has been less than
anticipated. We expect a further slowing in the third quarter as consumer
spending strengthens and as short-term interest rates rise--with the slowing
in such deposit inflows becoming more pronounced to the extent the money
market tightens. Under alternative A, we would expect the 3-month bill rate
between now and mid-year to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4 per cent range, and it may be
expected to rise somewhat above that range in the summer as the Treasury finances
large and partly seasonal cash needs. Under alternative B, the 3-month bill
would be likely to move into a 4-5/8--5-1/4 per cent range by or shortly
after mid-year; and the rate would likely be substantially higher under
alternative C.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1971-06-29,13,"(13) Alternative A. The following language is proposed for
possible use if the Committee decides to call for preserving about the
same money market conditions to which the credit markets have adjusted in
recent weeks, subject to a proviso clause.
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead,
taking account of developments in capital markets.] System
open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee
shall be conducted with a view to MAINTAINING PREVAILING
[DEL: achiveing bank reserve and] money market conditions; [DEL: consistent
with those objectives] PROVIDED THAT SOMEWHAT FIRMER CONDITIONS
SHALL BE SOUGHT IF IT APPEARS THAT THE MONETARY AND CREDIT
AGGREGATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING THE GROWTH PATHS EXPECTED
AND IF CAPITAL MARKETS ARE NOT UNDER EXCESSIVE PRESSURE.""
If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the
money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (6) as a
description of ""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso
clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connec-
tion with alternative A as the ""expected"" paths. The proviso clause has
been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against excesses but not
shortfalls, on the assumption that the Committee would not want money
market conditions to be eased in the coming period if the aggregates
should fall short of the indicated paths. The proposed language con-
templates that firming actions under the proviso clause would be
taken only ""if capital markets are not under excessive pressure.""
","Alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1971-07-27,13,"(13) Time and savings deposits other than large CD's are
expected to grow much less rapidly over coming months than in the second
quarter, given the recent weakening in such deposits and continued
relatively attractive market interest rates. Thus, under alternative A,
growth in M2 is expected to drop to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate in August,
and to 8 per cent in the third quarter; growth would be a little slower
under alternative B.
","alternative A, alternative B"
1971-09-21,13,"(13) Under any of the alternatives presented, funds available to
banks from U.S. Government deposits, private demand deposits, and time
deposits other than large CD's taken together are likely to grow much less
rapidly on balance in September and the fourth quarter than they had in the
spring and summer. As a result, banks may be led to bid actively for large
CD's should business and other loan demands be strong, as would be expected
if economic recovery proceeds at the accelerated rate indicated in the staff
GNP projection. Under alternative A, the adjusted bank credit proxy is
expected to grow at an 8 per cent annual rate in September and 4-1/2 per
cent in the fourth quarter. Under alternative C, the growth rate in the
bank credit proxy in the fourth quarter is expected to be around 6-1/2 per
cent, as banks in a period of declining interest rates add to investments
for purposes of obtaining high yields or capital gains.
Possible directive language
","alternative A, alternative C"
1971-11-16,13,"(13) Growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's
is expected to slow in late November and December from the recent rapid
pace. On balance, under alternative A/B, we would anticipate a growth
rate in consumer-type time deposits of around 11 per cent in the fourth
quarter, but slowing to about 7 per cent in the first quarter as consumer
spending continues to rise. Such a development would lead to growth
rates for M2 of 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 per cent in the fourth and first quarters,
respectively. Growth rates would be somewhat more rapid under alterna-
tive C as lower market interest rates enhanced the relative attractiveness
of bank deposits.
","alternative A"
1971-12-14,13,"(13) The growth rate of M1 is expected to slow in January, except
under alternative C. The assumption of a smaller than usual OFDI-related
reflow at year-end temporarily depresses the level of M1 in January and its
rate of growth relative to December. If the reflow turns out to be larger
than assumed M1 growth would, of course, be greater in January. Over the
longer-run, as any temporary distortions of year-end seasonal patterns are
worked out, we would expect M 1 for the first quarter of next year to grow at
a 6 per cent annual rate under A, a 7 per cent rate under B, and an 8 per cent
rate under C. It should be remembered that we have not worked into the monthly
or weekly figures any allowance for reflows arising from an international
","alternative C"
1972-09-19,13,"(13) The monetary aggregates under alternative B and C are con-
sistent with progressive firming in reserve and money market conditions over
the months ahead; however, alternative B moves in this direction more
gradually than alternative C. The first stage of firming, between now and
the next meeting of the Committee, would probably result in a Federal funds
rate moving up to a range around 5-1/8 per cent under B and around 5-3/8 per
cent under C. But the funds rate would probably need to rise in added stages

to around 5-3/4 and 6 per cent, respectively, under the two alternatives
by mid-December, as RPD growth was further restrained to reduce M1 expansion
to the annual rates shown for the first quarter in the table in paragraph (11).
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative C"
1972-11-20,13,"(13) Under alternative A, the staff would anticipate a decline in
the funds rate, and an accompanying reduction in member bank borrowing, between
now and the next meeting of the Committee. This would very likely lead to
reductions in the bill rate, despite the increase in Treasury borrowing, and
to further declines in long-term rates.
","alternative A"
1972-12-19,13,"(13) Long-term interest rates may show only little, if any,
increase under alternative B in view of the moderate size of long-term
credit demands. The more substantial rise in short rates anticipated under
alternative C, however, probably would exert considerable pressure on
longer-term markets. This would be expected on anticipatory grounds alone,
but would be reinforced as unfavorable rate relationships put savings inflows
to banks and other institutions increasingly under downward pressure.
Proposed directives
","alternative B, alternative C"
1973-01-16,13,"(13) To achieve the aggregates of alternative B, the staff
expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail-
ing levels, given the continuing strong transaction demands for money
implicit in the rapid growth in nominal GNP projected for the first and
second quarters. The potential for money market tightening implied by
the alternative B monetary target paths is indicated by the 5-5/8--6-1/4
per cent Federal funds rate range shown for that alternative. Even with
RPD over the forthcoming January-February period rising in a 10--12 per
cent annual rate range, we would expect the funds rate to move up to

1973-03-19,13,"(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discuss-
ed in the preceding section. The reference to credit markets is pro-
posed for elimination only in alternative A, the only alternative
that contemplates a significant easing of the money market. In view
of uncertainties as to how the current international exchange crisis
will be unwound, a reference to international developments is suggested
for all three alternatives.

1973-04-17,13,"(13) Under alternative A, the staff would expect a decline
in the Federal funds rate to accompany an effort to encourage more rapid
growth in the aggregates, and vice-versa for alternative C. However,
even-keel may constrain the Committee's willingness to adopt reserve
objectives that lead to changes in money narket conditions of the
dimensions of alternatives A and C. If the Committee were to choose
alternative A or C, but limit the downward or upward movement of the
funds rate to smaller dimensions than indicated, it would, of course,
extend the period needed to achieve the aggregate objectives of either
Proposed directive
","alternative A, alternative C, alternative A"
1973-06-18,13,"(13) Even with a continuation of current money market conditions,
short- and long-term interest rates over the next few weeks may be under
some further upward pressure. Short rates do not appear to have adjusted
fully to the higher day-to-day rates now prevailing, and the yield spread
between short- and long-term markets is abnormally small and in some cases
negative. Interest rates would, of course, come under greater upward
pressure if money market conditions should tighten, as they might under
either alternative B or C. However, market expectations concerning the
likely content and effectiveness of Phase IV will be critical for interest
rate behavior.
","alternative B"
1973-08-21,13,"(13) In the August-September period M1 growth under alternative B
is indicated to be in a 2--4 per cent annual rate range. A particularly low
growth rate is shown for August, reflecting in part drawdowns in cash balances
for investment in higher yielding time deposits, especially the newly avail-
able, widely advertised long-term savings certificates. However, such a one-
time stock adjustment is likely to be short-lived in its effects on cash
balances mainly held for transactions purposes or for normal financial market
","alternative B"
1973-11-19,13,"(13) Under alternative A the Federal funds rate is likely to
decline toward 8-3/4 per cent by the next Committee meeting as reserves
are provided to support a movement toward the higher longer-run growth
path for the aggregates indicated under that alternative. And under
alternative C the funds rate is likely to rise toward 11-1/2 per cent
in the process of moving toward its lower aggregate growth path. Under
current circumstances, the market is sensitive to small changes in the
funds rate, and would be even more sensitive to sustained increases or
decreases. Thus, an appreciable decline in market rates is likely under
alternative A and a large rise under alternative C.
","alternative A, alternative C, alternative A, alternative C"
1974-02-20,13,"(13) Recent interest rate declines will be working to sustain
money demand in the months ahead, including demand for both cash balances
and interest-earning deposits. In the February-March period, M1 growth
in a 7½--9½ per cent annual rate range is indicated under alternative B.
Because of the sizable shortfall of M 1 in January, such a rate of in-
crease is needed to restore M1 to the desired longer-run growth path.
Growth of M1 in February may be particularly large, reflecting perhaps
a decline in U.S. Government deposits between January and February that
is virtually unprecedented in size. The Treasury redeemed $800 million
of maturing debt in mid-February and the cash deficit for February also
seems to be a little larger than seasonal.
","alternative B"
1974-03-18,13,"(13) Under alternative C, the expected rise of interest rates
would be much sharper--with the funds rate moving up into the 10¼--11 per
cent area--in order to bring the money supply back to the long run path by
mid-year. If interest rates rose so sharply, though, a strong effect on
money demand would be likely by the third quarter, with money growth in
that quarter projected to fell below a 4 per cent annual rate (unless
reserves were provided at a rate that would permit money market conditions to
ease sharply by around mid-year). A rise in the funds rate to as high as
summer at thrift institutions. The mortgage commitment policies of
those institutions would again be under considerable restraint
and the viability of the current time and savings deposit ceiling
rate structure would probably come into question if high interest rate
levels- with the 3-month bill rate moving over 9 per cent--were sustained
for some time. There could well be significant feedback effects on GNP
of such developments by late summer, though more particularly by the fourth
","alternative C"
1974-05-21,13,"(13) A somewhat more rapid longer-run rate of growth in M1 than
adopted by the Committee at its last meeting, such as envisioned under
alternative A, appears necessary if money market conditions are not to
tighten further. Under alternative A, the staff would expect the Federal
funds rate to trade most frequently around 11-11¼ per cent.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1974-07-16,13,"(13) Under alternative B pressures on thrift institutions would
be expected to be somewhat greater than during the second quarter. Growth
in deposits at mutuals and savings and loan associations is expected to
drop slightly to about a 3½ per cent annual rate, making no allowance for
Citicorp and similar issues--the timing, terms, and volume of which are
still unknown. Rough estimates based on the terms originally announced
suggested that about half the funds for the $850 million Citicorp issue
would come out of thrift institutions, about a quarter out of banks, and
a quarter from other market instruments. For a one-month period, this
would represent a reduction in deposits at thrift institutions by 1½ per
cent at an annual rate and in consumer-type time deposits at banks by
¾ per cent at an annual rate.
(13) Alternatives A and C specify faster and slower rates of
growth in monetary aggregates, respectively, than alternative B.
Alternative C contemplates little change from the Federal funds rate
that has come to prevail in recent weeks, and this would be expected to
lead to a slowing in the growth rate of M1 to around 4 per cent over the
second half of this year. The market is currently in process of adjusting
to a funds rate in the 13 per cent area, although the process of
adjustment does not appear to be complete. Under this alternative,
interest rates would likely rise further in the weeks immediately ahead,
and would rise by more than under alternative B over the longer run.
Between now and the next Committee meeting, the 3-month commercial paper
rate might move up to the 13 per cent area, the CD rate would adjust
upward, and upward pressures on the prime loan rate would be very strong
given these still higher market rates. Inflows to thrift institutions
would be further curtailed, and the mortgage market--apart from Govern-
ment support--would come under even greater constraint than at present.
","alternative B, alternative B, Alternative C, alternative B"
1974-08-20,13,"(13) Expansion in time deposits other than money market CD's
at banks is expected to slow a little further over the months ahead under
alternative B. While the Federal funds rate and other short-term rates
may decline somewhat, the increased availability of instruments attractive
to small savers (such as variable-rate debentures, money market mutual funds,
and Treasury and Federal agency issues) is likely to lead to continued
substitution of such instruments for Regulation Q-constrained time and
savings accounts. Growth in savings accounts at nonbank thrift institutions
is expected to remain quite weak under alternative B, thus continuing sub-
stantial constraint on the supply of private mortgage funds. Growth in
consumer-type time and savings at both banks and nonbank thrift institutions
would be even more constrained under alternative C, whereas growth in
such savings would begin to recover under alternative A.
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1974-11-19,13,"(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to
delete the reference to Treasury financing because the quarterly
refunding announced on October 30 has been completed.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-01-20,13,"(13) The net inflow at banks of time and savings deposits
(other than money market CD's) is expected to continue at about the
pace of the fourth quarter of 1974 under alternative C. Greater
inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits are assumed under
alternatives A and B in the months immediately ahead, but under
alternative A the rate of inflow is assumed to drop back somewhat in
the spring as interest rates begin to rise. Under all three alternatives,
the staff has assumed that savings inflows will be sustained in late
spring or early summer by initial payments of the proposed income tax
rebate--which would also tend temporarily to enlarge demand deposits.
Implied rates of growth for M2 under the three alternatives are shown in
the bottom panel of the summary table in paragraph (6).
","alternative C, alternative A"
1975-02-19,13,"(13) Alternative B contemplates a further decline in the
Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to about the middle of a
in the spring may not prove necessary, assuming that GNP is no weaker
than projected for the first half of this year and that the sharp
expansion in economic activity projected for the third quarter develops.
","Alternative B"
1975-03-18,13,"(13) Market interest rates probably would rise somewhat over
the weeks ahead under alternative B. The Treasury will continue to raise
sizable amounts of new cash, including continued cash additions to weekly
bill auctions, and dealer positions in Treasury issues are relatively
high. Moreover, the calendar of new corporate and municipal issues
remains exceptionally large. Stabilization of the funds rate around
Federal Reserve was no longer seeking actively to ease credit markets.
Thus, unless the economy turned out to be considerably weaker than currently
projected, the weight of Treasury and corporate long-term credit demands
would tend to exert upward pressure on market rates.
","alternative B"
1975-05-20,13,"(13) Alternative C contemplates a rise of the Federal funds
rate into a 5½-6½ per cent range. Under this option, the rise in short-
term interest rates may be substantial over the next few weeks--with the
would probably also rise significantly. It is expected that such a
tightening of money market conditions would lead to M growth over the
1
second and third quarters at around a 6 per cent annual rate. As market
interest rates rise, net inflows of time and savings deposits to banks
and thrift institutions would also diminish, as compared with alternative B.
Mortgage market conditions would certainly tighten further.
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1975-07-15,13,"(13) If the Federal funds rate were to rise in coming weeks
to the 6¾ per cent mid-point of the alternative C range, a very sub-
stantial upward adjustment in other short-term rates would likely ensue.
The 3-month bill rate would probably move up to around 7 per cent, the
commercial paper rate to around 7 per cent, and the general level of
the prime loan rate would adjust upwards. However, if the Federal funds
rate were stabilized at around 6 per cent, as is contemplated under
alternative B, no more than minor upward market rate adjustments, if
any, would seem likely in the weeks immediately ahead. The Treasury
will be adding substantial amounts to weekly and monthly bill auctions,
but private short-term credit demands still appear weak enough so that
Treasury bills can probably be readily marketed to banks and other
","alternative C, alternative B"
1975-08-19,13,"(13) The 50 basis points rise in the Federal funds rate
contemplated under alternative B would probably trigger roughly
commensurate advances in other short-term rates, and long-term
markets would also come under renewed upward rate pressure. Moderate
further tightening would tend to confirm the widespread expectation
that interest rates are now in a firming trend, and market professionals
could be expected to continue their recent generally cautious approach
to underwriting of new issues. Rising market interest rates would
exert further pressure on the bank prime rate, and rates on Treasury
and Federal agency securities would become increasingly competitive
for savings funds now flowing into the thrift institutions. Market
repercussions from the rise in the Federal funds rate of 100 basis points
or more contemplated under alternative C, of course, would be more
extreme. Securities markets for a time might experience difficulties
in handling flows of new debt offerings. The problem of disintermediation
at depositary institutions would become more serious and would arise
sooner than anticipated in the staff economic projection. This
would make early action on Regulation Q ceilings more urgent but,
even with such action, the general availability and cost of mortgage
financing could be significantly affected.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1975-09-16,13,"(13) While alternative A basically assumes little or no change
in the Federal funds rate between now and the next meeting, the staff
believes the funds rate would have to rise later in the fall if the
monetary aggregates are to remain on track with the Committee's longer-
run objectives. A funds rate in the 7-7 per cent area would be expected
by late fall, assuming a longer-run M1 objective characterized by 7 per
cent growth from QII '75 to QII '76 (the assumption of the Green Book
GNP projection), with further funds rate increases anticipated in the
first half of next year. Attainment of a longer-run 6 per cent annual
rate of growth in M1 would be likely to require more prompt and intensive
pressure on the funds market. In view of the further interest rate increases
expected given either of these two M1 growth rates,we have assumed, in
working out all of the alternatives in this bluebook, a small upward
adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings around year-end of ¼ to ½ percentage
point on time certificates. With this assumption, longer-run M2 growth
is projected toward the low end of the Committee's announced target
range under alternative A.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1975-11-18,13,"(13) A reduction in the funds rate over the next few weeks of
about the dimensions contemplated under alternative A would probably be
accompanied by similar declines in other short-term rates and by some further
decline in longer-term market rates. Mortgage market yields would also be
likely to drop as the outlook for continued savings inflows brightens. But
declines in mortgage yields, as well as in security rates, may be limited
insofar as market participants view the easing in money market conditions
as temporary. Market attitudes will, of course, be influenced by the nature
of incoming economic news and by the degree of use, if any, of other monetary
policy instruments.
","alternative A"
1976-02-17,13,"(13) The staff would not expect a decline in the funds rate to
be sustainable, given the FOMC's longer-run monetary growth ranges. If
alternative A were adopted, the funds rate would probably have to start
rising by early spring, and during the third and fourth quarters would
reach levels somewhat above those resulting under alternative B. However,
reflecting the initially somewhat more accommodative reserve policy under
alternative A, growth in the aggregates would be a little stronger in the
first half of 1976 than under alternative B. Monetary growth would, of
course, be somewhat less rapid in the second half.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A, alternative B"
1976-04-20,13,"(13) Under alternative A, the mid-point of the longer-run growth
target for M1 is 7 per cent. In order to achieve this more rapid growth,
money market conditions would probably have to ease somewhat over the
next few weeks, and the funds rate would probably remain below 5 per
cent until well into the summer months. Thereafter, however, interest
rates would need to rise, with the Federal funds rate probably reaching
the 6 per cent area in early 1977. Given the expected pattern of market
interest rates, interest-bearing deposits would likely remain quite strong
into the third quarter, but inflows would begin to slow later on as rates
on market instruments became more attractive.
","alternative A"
1976-05-18,13,"(13) The firming of money market conditions associated with
alternative C would also exert upward pressure on longer-term interest
rates over the next few weeks. Loan demands are still focused more on
securities markets than on banks. The corporate bond calendar has built
up further in recent weeks, partly in anticipation of higher interest rates
later, and the municipal calendar remains sizable. Moreover, the Treasury
is likely to continue raising much of its new cash in the coupon area.
Even if the Federal funds rate stabilizes around 5-1/4 per cent between
now and the next Committee meeting--as is contemplated under alternative B--
some further upward adjustment in longer-term, as well as short-term inter-
est rates may still occur, since markets probably have not yet fully
adjusted to a 5-1/4 per cent funds rate.
","alternative C, alternative B"
1976-06-22,13,"(13) Growth in M1 in the June-July period may be in a 3½-7½
per cent, annual rate, range under alternative C, only a little less than
under alternative B. In the short run, member banks could be expected
to offset the greater constraint on nonborrowed reserves that is specified
under alternative C by increasing their borrowing through the discount
window, as suggested in appendix Table I. Expansion of M2 over the forth-
coming 2-month period might be in a 5½-9½ per cent annual rate range, in
part reflecting reduced inflows to time and savings deposits (other than
money market CD's) as funds are increasingly diverted from such accounts to
higher-yielding market instruments.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1976-07-19,13,"(13) If the funds rate remains around 5¼ per cent over the next
four weeks, short-term interest rates are unlikely to change significantly.
Inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's at banks
can be expected to be higher than in June as a result of the declines in
interest rates since mid-year. Over the July-August period, M2 might
expand at an annual rate in an 8 to 12 per cent range. As the year pro-
gresses, however, rising market rates would probably slow net inflows of
time and savings deposits somewhat. The alternative B projection assumes
an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings in early 1977.
","alternative B"
1976-08-17,13,"(13) Alternative C involves a tighter monetary policy over the
next few weeks and assumes that the Federal funds rate rises to the mid-
point of a 5-1/4 to 6-1/4 per cent range. Such an increase would be likely
to spark substantial efforts by Government dealers to unload their posi-
tions, and would therefore probably lead to considerable short-run upward
adjustment in yields on Treasury securities. The 3-month bill rate might
rise 40 to 60 basis points to the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 per cent area, and Trea-
sury note and bond yields could increase 20 to 30 basis points.
","Alternative C"
1976-09-21,13,"(13) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated
under alternative C--with the funds rate range centered on 5¾ per cent--
might well lead to fairly sharp upward adjustments in market rates over
the next few weeks. Dealer bill positions are currently very large, and
the 3-month bill rate could move up to the 5 -6 per cent area. Holdings
of coupon issues are also fairly sizable, and strong efforts to secure
the paper profits on such positions could lead to an appreciable rise
in longer-term Treasury yields, with spill-over effects on other
longer-term markets.
","alternative C"
1976-10-19,13,"(13) Over the next few weeks, interest rates would be likely
to show little net change under alternative B. About $4 billion of pub-
licly-held debt maturing on November 15 will need to be rolled over, and
the Treasury may also take the opportunity to raise about $2-1/2 billion
of new cash. Private credit demands in short-term markets, including
demands at banks, are likely to remain quite moderate over the next few
weeks. With banks expected to receive large inflows of funds from M2
deposits, they probably will permit CD's to run off somewhat further over
the next few weeks and may also be substantial investors in intermediate-
and short-term issues offered in the Treasury refunding. Thus, interest
rates in short- and intermediate-term market sectors are not likely to be
under any pressure from market forces over the period immediately ahead.
However, some upward pressure on private long-term rates may be generated
if the Treasury offers a substantial amount of the new issues in the 10-
year and longer maturity area, given the existing relatively narrow spread
between Treasury and corporate issues and the sizable forward calendar of
corporate and State and local government bonds.
","alternative B"
1976-11-16,13,"(13) Under any of the alternatives presented, we expect M1
growth over the November-December period to be modest. Assuming unchanged
money market conditions over the next few weeks, as under alternative B,
M1 may expand in a 2½-6½ per cent annual rate range during the 2-month
period. Incoming data for early November suggest a sharp deceleration
in growth during the current month from the unusually high October rate
Moreover, growth is unlikely to strengthen in December, given the sluggish
expansion in economic activity now expected in the fourth quarter. If the
mid-point of the 2½-6½ per cent November-December range is realized, growth
in M1 from the third to the fourth quarter would be at almost a 7 per cent
annual rate.
","alternative B"
1976-12-20,13,"(13) Alternative C contemplates a tightening in the money
market over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to around
would be likely to follow, since most market participants appear to have
adjusted their current positions to expectations that the funds rate
will either decline or remain about unchanged over the near-term.
The 3-month bill rate, for example, might move up to the area of 5-5¼
per cent. After the initial reaction, however, further rate increases
might be quite limited. Some rate increases, particularly in longer-
term markets, could be partly reversed as the funds rate tended to
level off at the new higher level. The staff would expect that little
further increase in the funds rate would, in practice, be required to
achieve the FOMC's longer-run monetary growth rates.
Proposed directive
","Alternative C"
1977-01-17,13,"(13) Alternative A encompasses a reduction in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 3-4 per cent range over the next
few weeks. Under this assumption, M1 and M 2 over the January-February
period would be expected to grow at annual rates of 4-8 and 8-12 per
cent respectively. Interest rates would be expected to decline over
the next few weeks, but reductions maybe limited, particularly in
long-term markets. Expectations that interest rates would soon rise
might develop as the market observes faster growth in the aggregates and
as the pace of economic expansion picks up.
","Alternative A"
1977-02-15,13,"(13) Alternative C contemplates a tightening of the money
market over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to the mid-
point of a 4¾-5½ per cent range. Such a rise in the funds rate in the
weeks immediately ahead has probably not been discounted by the market,
and thus a fairly substantial upward adjustment in interest rates could
be expected to ensue. The 3-month bill rate would probably rise to
levels somewhat above 5 per cent. Yields on intermediate- and longer-term
issues would also increase, though probably by less than the rise in
short rates, given increases that have already occurred in longer-term
interest rates.
","Alternative C"
1977-05-17,13,"(13) The increases in short-term rates under alternative C
would probably also be accompanied by a fairly prompt return to ceiling
rates on time deposits at those banks and thrift institutions that
had lowered offering rates previously. Banks may also begin to
press CD offerings more consistently on the market, partly to lock
in funds at current interest costs. Depository institutions are
likely to raise their lending rates on business loans and mortgages.
Moreover--with outstanding mortgage commitments at record levels--
thrifts are likely to become considerably more cautious in making
new commitments. In bond markets, rates may show some increase, but
these increases may be limited by the continued large volume of
institutional funds seeking long-term outlets and by any effect that
a tightening of the money market may have in dampening inflationary
","alternative C"
1977-06-21,13,"(13) The alternative C specifications involve an increase of
the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½ per
cent range. This may be accompanied by growth in M-1 in the June-July
period at an annual rate in a range of 2½ to 6½ per cent. Money market
firming of the degree contemplated under this alternative probably would
produce a prompt, appreciable rise in short-term interest rates and some
increase in bond yields. The rise in short-term market rates probably
would induce more depository institutions to raise offering rates on
savings and time deposits to ceiling levels. Short-term rates might rise
far enough to trigger sizable outflows of savings funds to market
instruments and to induce banks to bid aggressively for negotiable CD's and
for the types of large-denomination time deposits included in M-2. If
ceiling rates are unattractive relative to market rates, beginning in July
some institutions may experience substantial withdrawals in connection
with heavy maturities of ""wild card"" accounts.1/
","alternative C"
1977-07-19,13,"(13) Further increases in interest rates are likely to develop
late this year and in the first half of next year if the midpoints of the
longer-run growth ranges contemplated under alternative B are to be
achieved. The funds rate might need to rise to about 6 per cent by year-
end and to about 6¼ per cent by the second quarter of 1978. This would
be an appreciably smaller rise in interest rates than the staff thought
likely last month. It allows for the higher average level of the money stock
over the next year that results from applying an unchanged growth rate to a
new base period in which there has been a substantial overshoot. (The
Federal funds rate projections four quarters ahead are shown in Appendix II).
","alternative B"
1977-09-20,13,"(13) An easing in the funds rate to the mid-point of a 5¼-6
per cent range is encompassed under alternative A. The lower interest
rates and more rapid near-term growth in the monetary aggregates would
require more upward interest rate pressure, and less monetary growth, in
early 1978--as compared with alternatives B and C--if growth in the
monetary aggregates over the QII '77-QII '78 period is to remain within
the FOMC's longer-run ranges. The projected funds rate pattern for
alternative A, as well as the other alternatives, is presented in
Appendix I.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1977-10-17,13,"(13) Growth in M-2 over the October-November period is likely
to be in a 5 -9 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
The time and savings deposit component of M-2 is expected to expand by
only slightly more than its reduced August-September pace. We continue
to anticipate little, if any, growth in outstanding large CD's at banks--
including the large-denomination time deposits that are included in M-2--
as short-term credit demands on banks remain moderate. In addition,
market rates are above bank ceiling rates on time deposits under $100,000
and maturing in less than four years, and this may be tending to con-
strain inflows of such deposits.
","alternative B"
1978-01-17,13,"(13) If the Federal Funds rate remains near its present
alternative B, short-term market interest rates will probably remain
near current higher levels. And given their increases since November,
bond yields may be fully adjusted to the current level of short-term
rates. Thus, yields in the corporate and tax-exempt bond markets may
remain essentially unchanged, and could even decline somewhat in response
to continuing strong institutional investment demands and a recent
reduction in new offerings of corporate bonds. However, on January 25,
the Treasury will announce terms for refunding more than $5 billion of
publicly-held issues maturing in mid-February; the Treasury may also
take the occasion to raise $1 to $2½ billion of new money.
","alternative B"
1978-02-28,13,"(14) Growth in M-2 over the February-March period is likely
to be in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
With market yields above the ceiling rates on savings deposits and all
maturities of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks,
inflows of such deposits are likely to remain modest in February-March.
However, growth in large denomination time deposits included in M-2 are
expected to continue to offset slow growth of deposits subject to Regu-
lation Q ceiling as banks aggressively seek funds to finance credit
","alternative B"
1978-03-21,13,"(13) Under alternative B, mortgage rates might rise
somewhat further in the intermeeting period as thrifts adjust
lending policies in response to sustained weak deposit inflows.
Bond yields, however, are expected to be essentially unchanged. The
forward calendar for corporate issues remains relatively modest and
institutional demands large. Furthermore, the forward calendar for
tax-exempt offerings continues below the exceptional 1977 level and
interest in such issues by fire and casualty insurance companies,
commercial banks, and individuals are projected to remain sizable.
","alternative B"
1978-04-18,13,"(13) Growth in M-2 over the April-May period is likely to
be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
Savings deposits at commercial banks are expected to show very small
growth at best, though larger-than-seasonal tax refunds to individuals
may temporarily strengthen flows into these deposits in coming weeks.
With market yields remaining above ceiling rates, small-denomination
time deposits at commercial banks are also likely to grow only moderately.
However, in view of continued strong loan demands, banks probably will
maintain their reliance on large-denomination time deposits. Since a
major portion of these deposits is included in M-2, the interest-bear-
ing component of this aggregate is expected to continue at near its
recent pace.
","alternative B"
1978-08-15,13,"(13) Growth in M-1 and M-2 under alternative B may be
in ranges of 5 to 9 and 6½ to 10½ per cent, respectively. It is
expected that continued issuance of the 6-month money market certificate
by banks and thrift institutions will tend to moderate adverse impacts
of rising interest rates on inflows of small-denomination time and
savings deposits; the beneficial effect is likely to be most marked
at thrift institutions, if recent experience is any guide. Neverthe-
less, the rising marginal cost of time and savings deposits, if not
an actual slowing of deposit inflows, is likely to exert additional
upward pressure on primary mortgage interest rates.
","alternative B"
1978-10-17,13,"(13) The longer-run alternative C ranges encompass growth
rates for M-2 and M-3 nearer to those currently in place. In addition,
alternative C calls for a slower longer-run growth in M-1--in a
upper end of that range would tend to compensate for the ""overshoot""
in M-1 expansion over the first three quarters of this year and would
lead to about a 6 per cent annual rate of growth from the end of
line of appendix III-1.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1978-11-21,13,"(13) If the Federal funds rate remains around the 9½ to 9¾
per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under
alternative A, short-term market rates may show mixed changes.
Private short-term credit demands are expected to remain relatively
strong in coming weeks. Nonetheless, the relatively wide spread between
rates on private short-term instruments and the Federal funds rate
may tend to narrow as it becomes clear that the System is not tightening
its policy stance further. The Treasury is expected to offer a
sizable volume of cash management bills in early December and to
continue to put more emphasis on 3-month bills in its weekly bill
offering. Thus, rates on shorter-term Treasury bills may tend to
move up somewhat from current relatively low levels, unless foreign
central bank acquisitions of these instruments once again become
sizable. With regard to longer-term markets, the expected issuance
of foreign-currency denominated securities will likely reduce the
volume of debt issued in the U.S. market over the next few months.
With a modest calendar of corporate and tax-exempt issues also in
prospect, bond yields are unlikely to rise from current levels and
may even decline. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, can be expected
to move higher as demands for loans continue strong at a time when
the thrift inflows are expected to slow.
","alternative A"
1978-12-19,13,"(13) Under alternative A, M-2 is projected to expand in a
more rapid pace than in recent weeks. This acceleration reflects
mainly the expected strengthening of M-1 and the anticipated end of
the recent decline in outstanding savings deposits. Growth in the
interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to be at about a 9 to
expansion in large time deposits that are not subject to interest
rate ceilings.
","alternative A"
1979-03-20,13,"(13) Under alternative B, with the funds rate remaining un-
changed from the currently prevailing level of 10 per cent or a little
higher, given the staff's GNP projection, we expect M-1 to increase
over the March-April period in a range centered on a 4 to 9 per cent
annual rate range. With growth at the midpoint of this range, the level
of M-l in April would be below the low end of the path implied by the
Committee's current longer-run range. Growth at the 9 per cent upper end
of the alternative B short-run range, would bring M-1 to a level in
April just above the low end of the Committee's longer-run range, as
shown in the chart on the next page.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1979-07-11,13,"(13) The table below presents three alternative longer-run
ranges for next year (the policy period from QIV '79 to QIV '80). These
ranges represent a continuation into 1980 of the policies toward the
Alt. A' Alt. B' Alt. C'
M-1 4½ to 7½ 3½ to 6½ 2½ to 5½
M-2 6½ to 9½ 5½ to 8½ 4½ to 7½
M-3 7½ to 10½ 6 to 9 4½ to 7½
Bank Credit 7½ to 10½ 6½ to 9½ 5½ to 8½
aggregates as indexed by M-1, represented by the proposed paths for 1979,
after adjustment for ATS effects. Thus, alternative B' essentially repre-
sents continuation of growth in M-1 at about 6 percent: the midpoint of
the alternative B' range is 5 per cent, and we have assumed that ATS
effects retard M-1 growth by only about 1 percent. Of course, the
projection of ATS effects into next year is highly uncertain, depending
as it does on as yet unknown Congressional or further judicial responses
to the recent court decision terminating ATS and similar accounts beginning
1/
January 1 of next year. Alternatives A' and C' are indexed by measured
M-1 growth of 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, or 7 and 5 percent
after adjusting for assumed ATS effects. These growth rates for 1980
basically extend the A and C paths for 1979, as explained in the preceding
","alternative B, alternative B"
1979-08-14,13,"(13) With Federal funds continuing to trade around 10½ to 10¾
percent, the midpoint of alternative B, other interest rates would likely
change little in the near term. Credit markets are not likely to be
subject to demand pressures over the next few weeks. The Treasury's
net borrowing activities during the intermeeting period may be limited to
an early September cash management bill to carry it through the mid-month
tax date, although the sale of a 5-year note is a possible alternative.
Market participants likely will be focusing more on the greater cash needs
confronting the Treasury in the fourth quarter. The forward calendars
in the corporate and municipal bond markets are moderate. Loan demands
at commercial banks may edge off, as inventory investment declines and
household spending continues weak. Use of bank credit lines, and there-
fore bank demands on the money markets, could be increased, however, by
any adverse developments in the commercial paper market associated with the
Chrysler situation. At thrift institutions, growth of deposits subject to
rate ceilings likely will remain sluggish, leading to continued borrowing
from Home Loan Banks and market sources.

1979-09-18,13,"(13) As shown in the upper panel of the chart on page 11, growth
in M-2 under alternative B would place that aggregate in October around the
upper end of its 5 to 8 percent longer-run range for the QIV '78 to QIV '7 9
period. And for the one-year period, staff projections indicate that M-2
will grow at a rate about equal to the upper limit. Largely reflecting
the slow deposit growth at thrifts because of the absence of the MMC inter-
institutional ceiling rate differential at current and projected rates of
interest, M-3 growth is expected to remain within its longer-run range, though
in the upper half.
","alternative B"
1979-11-20,13,"(13) The staff would expect that expansion in the aggregates
as specified under alternative B could be attained by growth (at annual
rates) in the family of reserve measures over November and December as
follows: monetary base, 7 percent; total reserves,7 percent; and non-
borrowed reserves, 15 percent. For purposes of constructing the nonborrowed
reserve path, given the current discount rate, member bank borrowings
were assumed to average $1 billion, the same initial assumption as
adopted by the Committee in early October.

B. In the February-June period, M-1A would expand at a 2¼ percent annual
rate. This alternative probably would require some further rise in the
federal funds rate over the next few weeks toward the 18 percent area.
Money market rates generally would follow the funds rate upward, but rate
effects in bond markets would tend to be dominated by factors influencing
inflationary expectations. The tightening of money markets that appears
needed under alternative C might be construed by the market as reinforcing
the new anti-inflation program, and this could lead to some easing of bond
market pressures even as short rates rise. Still, earnings pressures on
financial intermediaries would be intensified, and consumer and mortgage
credit conditions would tighten further. The dollar would likely strengthen
further, even though some additional U.S. monetary restraint would not come as
a great surprise to the market; foreign central bank intervention sales,
however, would likely limit the extent of the rise in the dollar's exchange
","Alternative C, alternative

1980-04-22,13,"(13) Growth in the aggregates at the rates specified under
alternative B implies an annual rate of growth from March to June of the
monetary base and of total reserves of about 4½ and 7½ percent, respectively.
On the assumption that member bank borrowings average around $1¾ billion
over the next few weeks and then decline to about $1¼ billion by mid-year,
nonborrowed reserves would increase at about a 20 percent annual rate over
the March-June period.1/ We have not made any special assumption about the
level of borrowing under the new temporary seasonal credit program. Such
borrowing as it develops would be considered to be economically equivalent
to nonborrowed reserves and therefore the nonborrowed reserve path would be
automatically adjusted to offset fluctuations in such credit.
","alternative B"
1980-05-20,13,"(13) The specifications for alternative A call for a considerable
pick-up in growth of M-2 for the May-June period, to about a 7¾ percent
annual rate. The implied rate of growth for the nontransactions component
of this aggregate period--at around an 8 percent rate--is considerably
higher than has occurred recently. A return to MMMF growth after the decline
associated with the March 14 actions appears already to have begun, and with
market rates far below their recent peaks, growth of small time and savings
deposits, especially the 2½ year variable ceiling certificates, is expected
to pick up.
","alternative A"
1980-07-09,13,"(13) To assist the Committee in evaluating the proposed ranges
for 1980 and in forming a preliminary view about monetary growth targets
in 1981, specific alternative assumptions for money growth in 1980 and
the subsequent two years, with their implications for economic activity,
prices, and interest rates, are presented in the table on page 11.
Strategy 1 in that table continues growth in narrow money measures at the
same rate in 1981 and 1982, as in 1980-that is, at a rate of about 4½ per-
cent for M-1A and 5-3/4 percent for M-1B. Of course, the ranges for M-1A
and M-1B may have to be adjusted next year for the introduction of
nationwide NOW accounts.1/ In addition, the staff's analysis suggests
that, even with the same effective M-1A growth as in 1980, M-2 and M-3 may
grow near the upper limits of the current year's ranges, or possibly
above them, as income flows and credit demands strengthen. To provide
the Committee with a basis for assessing a monetary policy that calls for

a gradual reduction in money growth rates, strategy 2 employs the
monetary assumptions of the first strategy for 1980, but then assumes
that growth in M-1A is reduced to 4 percent in 1981 and 3½ percent in
to 3½ percent in 1980 and maintaining that rate over the next two years.
All these strategies assume a tax cut of $25 to $30 billion that takes
effect in early 1981. Strategy 4 excludes a tax cut and assumes money
growth as in strategy 1.
","alternative a"
1980-08-12,13,"(13) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under
alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 5 percent
annual rate from July to September. Assuming a level of member bank
borrowing (excluding special borrowings) of about $100 million, nonborrowed
reserves would expand at about a 6-1/4 percent annual rate. With member
bank borrowings at such minimal levels, the federal funds rate would be
expected to fluctuate around the current 10 percent discount rate.
","alternative A"
1980-09-16,13,"(13) Short-term interest rates are not expected to rise
significantly further over the next few weeks under alternative A.
Indeed, some temporary drop in short rates could occur as bank reserve
positions under this alternative may be less taut than market participants
currently expect. But business borrowing demand is expected to remain
relatively large as the economy strengthens. The recent tilt in the
distribution of borrowing toward short- from long-term markets could
persist but the continuing need to restructure balance sheets is expected
to keep long-term borrowing sizable over the months ahead. With short-
rates remaining relatively high and the economy apparently strengthening,
there appears to be little scope for declines in bond or mortgage rates.
Indeed, mortgage rates could drift up a bit more under alternative A, in
part reflecting the recent run-up in the cost of deposits.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1980-10-21,13,"(13) Under alternative B there is less chance that interest
rates will rise in the near term. To achieve the aggregates specified
of the forthcoming intermeeting period--the phase-down of required reserves
will begin for member banks, as will the phase-in for nonmember depository
institutions. The targeted reserve growth rates in the text are cal-
culated so as to eliminate the discontinuity from the change in reserve
for this alternative, total reserves would have to expand at a 2¼ percent
annual rate from September to November. Assuming adjustment borrowing
of $1¼ billion, about the same as the September average, nonborrowed
reserves would expand at only about a 1¾ percent rate. The federal funds
rate is likely to remain within its recent 12½ to 13 percent zone. Under
such circumstances, other market rates would likely fluctuate around current
","alternative B"
1980-11-18,13,"(13) The further rise in interest rates under alternative B--the
underlying assumption for the Greenbook projection-is an element in the
staff's anticipation that real GNP will decline in early 1981. The dampening
of the transactions demand for money in lagged response to the run-up in
interest rates and to the projected weakening in economic activity suggest
that interest rates could temporarily ease in early 1981, assuming 1981
monetary targets as reported to the Congress in July.1 / However, for all
of next year, the effects of inflation on the transactions demand for money
are expected to require historically high interest rates in order to restrain
growth in the monetary aggregates to the preliminary FOMC targets.
","alternative B"
1981-02-02,13,"(13) As shown in the upper panel of charts 1 and 2 on the following
pages, alternative A is based on growth in M-1a and M-1B at a rate that would
bring the level of these aggregates by March to the midpoints of their
tEntative longer-run ranges adopted in July. This implies growth in M-1B

over the first three months of the year at about a 7½ percent annual rate,
given the shortfall that developed in December. Alternative 3 achieves
the midpoint of the alternative II longer-run path by March, and implies
growth in M-1B at a 6¾ percent annual rate over the first three months of
first quarter, and specifies from that lower base the same growth rate in
the narrow aggregates over the first three months of the year that had been
adopted by the Committee at its December meeting. This alternative implies
relatively slow growth in February and March, as shown in last column of the
middle panel of the table on page 9.
","alternative A"
1981-05-18,13,"(14) The outlook for interest rates under all three alternatives
suggests continued weakness in mortgage demands and also intense earnings
pressures on thrift institutions, with alternative C implying a higher
probability of a number of failures this summer. Moreover, with their
deposit flows weak--and less than they may have anticipated--some institu-
tions may find it necessary to draw down their stock of liquid assets.
Although the new mortgage instruments recently approved by the FHLBB are
likely to be translated into an increased willingness of thrifts to make
mortgage loans, their impact on interest income will be modest for some
Directive language
","alternative C"
1981-08-18,13,"(13) Given below are two alternative operational paragraphs
for the directive. Alternative I retains the structure of the current
directive, focusing on the June to September growth rate for M1-B, with
the proviso adopted at the last meeting related to M2. The language
would be consistent with either alternatives A or B (with the directive
indicating under B that the Committee had lowered its third quarter
M1-B target). In this directive structure, it would need to be recognized,
however, that the proviso clause for M2 might well be promptly triggered
given the staff's current expectation of a strengthening in M2 growth.
The language of alternative II would be consistent with a
decision by the Committee to choose an M1-B growth rate over the balance
of the quarter presently thought needed to exert desired restraint on M2,
without prejudging that a lower growth in M1-B than earlier targeted for
the quarter will in practice be required. Thus, if this directive included
the July to September growth rate for M1-B in alternative B, the language
of the directive would permit the higher growth in M1-B needed to meet the
bound of its longer-run range. This language is similar to the approach
adopted by the Committee at the last mid-quarter meeting on May 18.
Alternative I
In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from June to September
at an annual rate of [DEL: 7] ____ percent after allowance for the impact
of flows into NOW accounts (resulting in growth at an annual rate
of about [DEL: 2] ____ percent from the average in the second quarter to
the average in the third quarter), provided that growth of M2
remains around the upper limit of [DEL:, or moves within,] its range for
the year. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will
continue to distort measured growth in M1-B to an unpredictable
extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the
light of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call
for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for
Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and
related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting
is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently
outside a range of [DEL: l5 to 21] ____ TO ____ percent.
Alternative II
In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates consistent with a pick-up in growth of M1-B from July
to September to an annual rate of ____ percent, or somewhat
higher, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts.
Provided that growth of M2 remains around the upper limit of, or
moves within, its range for the year, growth of M1-B at an annual
rate somewhat higher than the ____ percent specified above would
be acceptable, in light of the relatively weak growth experienced
in July and the objective adopted by the Committee at its July
meeting for growth from June to September at an annual rate of
from the average in the second quarter to the average in the third
quarter). It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will
continue to distort measured growth in M1-B to an unpredictable
extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light
of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call for
Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic
Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related
reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely
to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside
a range of [DEL: 15 to 21] ____ TO ____ percent.

","alternative B"
1981-10-05,13,"(13) The specifications of alternative B call for a more rapid
growth in M1-B at around a 9 percent annual rate from September to
December, sustained by 6 percent annual rate of growth in total reserves.
The federal funds rate under these conditions is likely to decline to
around the current 14 percent basic discount rate or just below. Adjust-
ment borrowing at the discount window would move down to minimal levels
in the area of $200 to 300 million or so. Nonborrowed reserve growth
would be at a 14 percent annual rate over the next three months.
","alternative B"
1981-11-17,13,"(13) Alternative B would require expansion in total reserves
at a 6 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year, while
growth in reserves under alternative C would be at a 4½ percent annual
rate. The staff believes short-term rate declines under alternative B
could carry the funds rate into the 10 to 12 percent range. The aggre-
gates specifications of alternative C are likely to be associated with a
funds rate in a 12 to 14 percent range, implying the that the funds rate
could drop below the current discount rate.
","Alternative B, alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1982-02-01,13,"(13) Alternative B is designed to attain the upper limit of
the 2½ to 5½ percent range for M1 by June. That would be achieved, as
shown in Chart 1, by extending the January to March annual growth rate of
like alternative A, would be consistent with growth for 1982 at around the
midpoint of the longer-run range. Alternative C, which involves about a
quarter, is designed to reach the upper end of the M1 range by September.
Such an approach would be more consistent with growth for the year in the
upper half of the longer-run range.
","Alternative B, alternative A, Alternative C"
1982-03-29,13,"(13) The alternative B specifications, which call for M1 growth
at a 3 percent rate from March to June, imply an increase in total
reserves at a 7 percent rate. Assuming adjustment borrowing of $1¼
billion, nonborrowed reserves would also increase at around a 7 percent
rate, and the federal funds rate would likely fluctuate around 14 percent
or a bit higher. Other interest rates would probably continue to fluctuate
within the range of the past several weeks, absent any substantial change
in the fiscal outlook. In addition, to the extent that the market has
discounted a considerable bulge in money growth in April, market rates
could decline somewhat if such a bulge does not develop.
","alternative B"
1982-05-18,13,"(13) The 3-month bill rate under alternative A would probably
drop below the current discount rate, and range around 11 percent. A
substantial bond market rally might well ensue, especially if it appeared
that Congress was in process of significantly reducing federal budget
deficits. A considerable depreciation of the dollar on exchange markets
might also take place, although this trend would be limited if foreign
monetary authorities took the opportunity to permit their interest rates
to decline further. Reduced deposit costs would diminish earnings
pressures over time on thrifts, work toward making them more willing
mortgage lenders, and contribute to further declines in mortgage rates.
","alternative A"
1982-08-24,13,"(13) Under this alternative corporate bond rates might remain
around 14 percent or fall somewhat lower, depending in part on how large
a surge in corporate bond issuance develops. Most of the proceeds from
expansion in bond issues would be used to pay down bank loans and to redeem
commercial paper. The weakening of business loan demand and sustained
relatively low market rates would likely cause banks to cut the prime rate
to less than 13 percent over the next few weeks. The mortgage markets
would benefit from the decline in interest rates generally and from im-
proved prospects for thrift institution profitability. Mortgage rates are
unlikely to fall below the 15 percent level, however, so that the boost to
housing would be modest. Short-term U.S. interest rates at around recent
levels would give foreign authorities greater scope to ease their interest
rates further, which would probably forestall any appreciable weakening of
the dollar on exchange markets over the near-term.
","alternative c"
1982-10-05,13,"(13) Bond rates are likely to remain near current levels under
alternative B, and could even decline a bit further if investors continue
to see little, if any, sign of an economic recovery. Despite the further
reduction in deposit costs at S&Ls and MSBs--as higher-cost deposits are
rolled over--thrift hesitancy to commit funds and a leveling off of bond
rates is likely to keep mortgage rates from falling much below 15 percent.
","alternative B"
1982-11-16,13,"(13) An increase in the Committee's fourth-quarter M2 target to
a 10 percent annual rate, as in alternative A, might be required for some
further easing of money market conditions in an environment of continued
strong liquidity demands on the part of the public. The percentage point
of more rapid growth in M2 under this alternative, as compared with
alternative B, would entail a relatively more rapid expansion in M1--by
about 1¼ percentage points over the 3-month period. What information we
have suggests that--in view of the availability of market-related rates
on instruments encompassed by M2--M1 may have at least twice the elasticity
with respect to market interest rates as M2. Thus, a given change in
market interest rates will have a more substantial impact on M1 growth
rates than on M2 rates.
","alternative A, alternative B"
1984-05-21,13,"(13) The specifications of alternative A contemplate some
easing of pressures on bank reserve positions over the coming inter-
meeting period consistent with somewhat faster growth of the aggregates
than under alternative B. M1 and M2 would be expected to grow a little
faster than the pace chosen by the Committee in March. Borrowing might
fall to around $600 to $750 million and the federal funds rate drop to
an average of around 9-3/4 to 10 percent under this alternative.
Nonborrowed reserves would be expected to increase at around a 15
percent annual rate.
","alternative A, alternative B"
1984-08-21,13,"(13) The specifications of alternative A are designed to bring
M1 and M2 closer to the path adopted at the previous Committee meeting,
while not leading to much more rapid M3 and credit growth. They involve
an easing of bank reserve positions, with borrowing dropping to around
$750 million. Nonborrowed reserves would be expected to increase at about
a 6 percent annual rate, and total reserves at about half that pace, over
the July-to-September period. Federal funds may trade between 10-1/2
and 11 percent, perhaps not immediately but over time as the lower level
of borrowing persists. Such a reduction in bank reserve pressures does
not appear to be anticipated by the market, and probably would extend the
recent rally in bond and stock markets, as well as lead to a decline in
short-term rates and a narrowing of quality spreads. The Treasury bill
rate is likely to fall below 10 percent, and 3-month CDs to around 11 per-
cent. The decline in interest rates would relieve some of the immediate
pressures on thrift earnings and reduce tensions generally in the financial
system. As interest rates fell, the dollar would tend to depreciate on
foreign exchange markets.
","alternative A"
1984-10-02,13,"(14) The somewhat more rapid money growth specifications of
alternative A would be expected to involve a further reduction in
pressures on bank reserve positions, with discount window borrowing
declining to around $500 million. Nonborrowed reserves would increase at
about a 6 percent annual rate over October and November. The federal
funds rate would drop to 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent, or possibly a little
lower if the pattern of discount window borrowing evident before last May
","alternative A"
1984-12-17,13,"(13) Short-term rates are not likely to show much change on
balance over the intermeeting period under alternative B, with the 3-month
Treasury bill rate generally in an 8-1/8 to 8-3/8 percent range; the prime
rate may drop a little further, given current rate relationships. In
long-term markets, yields could move somewhat higher should there be no
real progress toward putting together a credible deficit reduction package,
if there were signs of strengthened economic activity, and if M1 growth
were sustained as expected under alternative B. Mortgage rates may
stabilize in the period immediately ahead, and could begin to rise, parti-
cularly should bond rates turn up as the first quarter progresses.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1985-11-04,13,"(13) The drop in market interest rates under alternative A may
be appreciable. The 3-onth Treasury bill rate could fall to 6-3/4
percent, or perhaps somewhat lower if expectations of a discount rate cut
became widespread. The large volume of Treasury coupon issues expected
over the next few weeks would be easily absorbed by strong investor
demand to lock in relatively high yields. The dollar would probably drop
noticeably further on foreign exchange markets.
","alternative A"
1985-12-16,13,"(13) Assuming little change in reserve market conditions as
under alternative B, long-term interest rates are likely to stabilize
around their recently reduced levels, or perhaps back up somewhat. Some
further decline could develop if incoming economic data are weak, but the
recent drop in bond yields seems already to have incorporated the near-
term impact of deficit reduction measures and weakness in certain commodity
prices. Short-term rates under alternative B could reverse much of their
very recent declines, which appear to have been influenced by anticipation
of some easing in monetary policy by early next year. The 3-month Treasury
bill rate might be expected to rise to near 7-1/4 percent. Should reserve
conditions ease, as contemplated under alternative A, long-term interest
rates would probably continue to drop, though probably not as rapidly as
in recent weeks because further rate declines may begin to foster an
actual or anticipated increase in longer-term borrowing. The 3-month
bill rate might fall toward 6-3/4 percent, and the dollar is likely to come
under renewed downward pressure on foreign exchange markets. The firming
of reserve conditions contemplated under alternative C, although slight,
would be quite unexpected and would prompt a substantial back up in
short-term and long-term rates, at least for a time. Significant upward
pressure on the dollar would probably emerge.
Directive language
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1986-04-01,13,"(13) Alternative A encompasses some easing of reserve conditions,
with discount window borrowing dropping to minimum levels of $100 to $150
million, and the federal funds rate averaging around, or a little below,
the 7 percent discount rate. While some monetary easing may be anticipated
in the current structure of market rates, those interest rates probably
would decline further under this approach, partly on more widespread expecta-
tions of another reduction in the discount rate. Depending on the pervasive-
ness of such expectations, the 3-month Treasury bill rate may fluctuate
around a 6 to 6-1/4 percent area. Long-term rates are not likely to
decline by more than short-term rates, and probably by less, assuming no
further change in inflation expectations. The dollar would probably
again come under donward pressure, particularly if other leading central
banks did not also ease monetary conditions.

1986-05-20,13,"(13) Alternative C encopasses an increase in discount window
borrowing to between $450 and $550 million. The federal funds rate prob-
ably would move back into the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent neighborhood. M1
growth in June would be expected to be reduced to around 5 percent under
these circumstances. Although this aggregate would still be above its
parallel band in June, the near-term tightening of market conditions
would raise the odds that M1 would move to within its longer-run range
later in the year as the increase in rates and its effects on spending
tended to damp demands for transactions balances in the second half. M2
would remain in the lower portion of its range through midyear, though
well above the lower end, while M3 would be at about the middle of its
","Alternative C"
1986-08-19,13,"(13) Short- and long-term interest rates are expected to remain
around their current levels under alternative B, at least initially, though
with federal funds continuing to trade in a 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 area some modest
upward pressures on interest rates could emerge as market participants begin
to reassess the odds on a near-term easing in policy. Nevertheless, the
dollar could continue to drift lower on foreign exchange markets. In addi-
tion to the usual economic news, financial markets may be confronted with
important developments in tax reform and federal budget policy that could
significantly affect investor sentiment during the weeks ahead.
","alternative B"
1986-12-15,13,"(13) Alternative A assumes a reduction in discount window borrow-
ing to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a reduction in the dis-
count rate of one-half percentage point with borrowing maintained at $300
million. The federal funds rate, in either event, would decline to the
with the three-month bill likely dropping to 5 percent or a little below.
The dollar could come under greater downward pressure on foreign exchange
markets, unless other major central banks were similarly to ease. A weaker
dollar and possibly heightened concerns about inflation could limit the scope
for bond rate declines. That scope could widen, though, should incoming
indicators on the economy point to more softness early in the year than is
now generally expected and to subdued price pressures.
","Alternative A"
1987-02-10,13,"(13) Alternative II, embodying the Committee's tentative ranges,
could be seen as balancing these risks. The staff's expectations for M2
and M3 growth, around the middle of this alternative's ranges, suggest com-
parable odds of running either very high or very low in the range. The
alternative II range would provide for some restraint on income growth should
inflationary pressures tend to intensify, and the upper ends of the ranges
would allow further substantial declines in velocity should they materialize.
The downward adjustment of the ranges from 1986 to 1987 would convey the
Committee's sense that slower money growth over time will be necessary to
sustain and consolidate progress toward price stability. At least a modest
slowing of money growth in 1987 would be required under alternative II, given
that the upper ends of the ranges of this alternative are a little below
actual growth in 1986.
","alternative a"
1987-05-19,13,"(13) Alternative C assumes either a $200 million increase, to
$600 million, in the borrowing allowance used to construct reserve paths,
or a rise in the discount rate of one-half percentage point. With the
market already anticipating some firming of policy, any increase in the
federal funds and other market rates under this alternative might be rela-
tively muted, although a discount rate increase could have a more sizable,
temporary impact on very short-term rates. Federal funds might settle into
a 6-3/4 to 7 percent range, and bill rates might rise to around 6-1/4 percent
or a little higher. Any upward adjustment of Treasury bond yields probably
also would be comparatively small, as this policy action would tend to temper
bearishness about the dollar in exchange markets, especially if it were
accompanied by further easing moves abroad, and relieve some anxieties about
the outlook for U.S. inflation. Quality spreads could widen some, however,
if the higher rates were seen as raising the odds on a weak economic perform-
ance, or were to intensify concerns about the international debt situation.
An additional increase in the prime rate seems likely under this alternative.
","Alternative C"
1987-08-18,13,"(13) With respect to the long-run ranges, M2 growth from the
fourth quarter to September is expected to come to only 4-1/4 percent under
alternative B. Expansion at around an 11-1/2 percent rate over September to
December would be required to hit the lower end of the long-run range in the
fourth quarter; 9-1/2 percent growth would be needed to bring this aggregate
to the lower end of its growth cone in December. While a further strengthen-
ing of M2 growth is possible over the fourth quarter should some of the
unusual weakness of earlier this year be reversed, an acceleration of this
magnitude would seem unlikely without a very substantial decline in interest
rates by early in the fourth quarter. M3 growth from its fourth-quarter
base would be at a 5-1/4 percent rate by September under alternative B.
With moderate increases in bank and thrift credit projected, this aggregate
is likely to climb to within the lower portion of its range in the fourth
quarter, even if interest rates moved a little higher in the latter part of
the year, as in the staff forecast. Nonfinancial debt is still expected to
grow 9-1/2 percent in 1987 on a quarterly average basis, in the middle of
its 8 to 11 percent range. Growth of M1 from the fourth quarter of 1986 to
September is projected at 6-1/2 percent under alternative B; with rates re-
maining close to current levels under this alternative through the third
quarter, M1 growth for the year is not likely to differ very much from its
growth through September.
","alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1987-09-22,13,"(13) Under alternative C, the borrowing assumption would be raised
to $800 million. The federal funds rate would move up to 7-3/4 percent or a
little above, after the markets had adjusted to this further tightening of
pressures on reserve positions. Other short-term market rates might also
rise by around 1/2 percentage point, with the 3-month bill rising to about
relatively narrow spread of this rate over CDs now prevailing. The dollar
could firm a little, at least in the near term, and the perceived willingness
to tighten policy could postpone emergence of any subsequent downward pressure
on the dollar. Bond yields probably would move higher, although if the mar-
kets were to view this measure as forestalling future inflationary pressures,
any rise in long-term rates could be rather small.
","alternative C"
1987-11-03,13,"(13) Under alternative B, persistence of the federal funds rate
near 7 percent implies that a substantial rise of Treasury bill rates would
accompany a partial restoration of normal interest rate relationships. As
exceptional demands for short-term Treasuries unwind, the 3-month bill rate
could move from the current 5-1/4 percent level to perhaps around 6 percent,
while private rates might rise relatively little. Even with a rate backup,
short-term rates would be 1/2 to 1 full percentage point below their aver-
age levels prior to the stock market crash. As a consequence, opportunity
costs of liquid deposits would still be appreciably below early fall peaks.
Interest rate incentives could thus begin to reinforce the impact of any

added liquidity preference in bolstering inflows to the liquid deposit and
money market fund components of the aggregates. At the same time, however,
a return toward more normal volumes of financial transactions would tend to
depress demand deposits from recently elevated levels. Under these condi-
tions, M2 might expand from September to December at around a 6 percent
annual rate. This outcome would bring M2 growth for the year to 4-1/2 per-
cent, compared with its 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent long-run range. Growth of
its M1 component would be expected to slow substantially following its
October bulge, with growth at 8 percent over the September to December
period and about 7 percent for the year.
","alternative B"
1987-12-15,13,"(13) M1 growth is expected to average 4 percent over the next four
months under alternative B. This represents a slight pickup from its
average pace over October and November, abstracting from the effects of
the bulge. Little expansion is expected on a month-average basis in
December, given the pattern of growth in late November and early Decem-
ber. But with interest rates essentially flat, increases averaging 5
percent at an annual rate are projected over the first three months of
next year. Even so, the monthly pattern of M1 growth is expected to
produce an increase in velocity of 2 percent in the first quarter.
","alternative B"
1988-03-29,13,"(13) M1 growth in April might be boosted by a buildup in trans-
action balances associated with tax payments, which are projected to exceed
the typical volume reflected in the transactions account seasonals, though
abated by early May. On a March-to-June basis, M1 is expected to increase
at a rate of about 4-1/2 percent under alternative B. Demand deposits are
anticipated to strengthen only a little on balance over the next three
months, after the somewhat inexplicable weakness through the first quarter.
NOW account growth, while moderating from recent rapid rates, would remain
above the pace of the second half of 1987. M1 velocity would continue to
increase, but at a slower rate than in the first quarter.
","alternative B"
1988-05-17,13,"(13) The higher market interest rates associated with alternative
C would further damp money growth. M1 would show little expansion in May
and June; reduced compensating balance requirements would constrain demand
deposits, and still wider opportunity costs would make NOW accounts, along
with other liquid retail accounts, even less attractive. Slower M2 growth
through June would be expected to bring its March-to-June pace to 6-1/4
percent, and its expansion from the fourth quarter to 7 percent. M3 could
be supported somewhat by a further shifting of business credit demands to
banks as higher bond yields curtail firms' offerings of longer-term debt,
necessitating greater reliance on managed liabilities by banks than under
alternative B.
","alternative
C, alternative B"
1988-06-29,13,"(13) Of the long-run ranges, alternative III would be most appro-
priate if the risks were seen to be on the side of demands outpacing
productive capacity, threatening progress toward price stability. This is
the assessment implicit in the staff GNP forecast, and the degree of
monetary restraint needed in that forecast to damp domestic demand and
check inflationary pressures would seem to require some reduction in the
lower bound of the M2 range. Even with the one-point decrease under this
alternative, M2 would be expected to be in the lower half of its range
given the staff forecast. M3 and debt would be in the middle of their
alternative III ranges. The upper bounds of the reduced ranges of this
alternative allow some scope for less restraint and lower interest rates
if the economy turns out to be weaker than anticipated, but relative to
the other ranges would provide for fairly prompt resistance to unexpected
strength in the economy. On balance, the alternative III ranges would
seem to imply an intention that nominal income decelerate in 1989, thus
underscoring a commitment of policy to work toward gradually slowing
inflation rates in 1989 and beyond.
","alternative a"
1988-08-16,13,"(13) The tightening of reserve positions under alternative C
immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising
to market participants and the associated 1/2 percentage point increase in
the funds rate probably would show through nearly fully in private money
market rates. Nominal bond yields probably would rise by less. This
action might allay market concerns about future inflation, implying that
the rise in nominal interest rates would reflect at least as large an
increase in real rates. The higher real rates would boost the dollar on
foreign exchange markets, at least for a time, and the greater foreign
demand for dollar assets could cushion somewhat the effects on bond and
stock prices.
","alternative C"
1988-09-20,13,"(13) Under alternative A, M2 and M3 would strengthen over the
August-to-December period. Partly owing to some narrowing of opportunity
costs, M2 by December would likely be growing at a rate around the 5 per-
cent midpoint of its provisional range for next year, and M3 at 7 percent.
An immediate easing would come as a surprise to market participants, given
the recent policies and statements of the Federal Reserve and current per-
ceptions that inflationary pressures, though perhaps less certain to mount,
are not likely to moderate substantially. Short-term market rates would
drop immediately by about the full extent of the easing in the funds rate,
and bond yields would also decline. The initial bond market response could
be substantial, but if data failed to confirm some further moderation in
the economy and price pressures, bond yields could retrace much of these
declines, especially if downward pressure on the dollar persisted.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1988-12-13,13,"(13) Credit-financed corporate restructuring is expected to boost
the growth rate of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors to a 10 percent
annual rate from November to March, leaving this aggregate in the upper half
of its tentative 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent range for 1989. Net equity
retirements over these four months are projected at a record pace, with
business borrowing at banks and in the commercial paper market bearing the
brunt of the outsized credit demands. Abstracting from the effects of the
pickup in equity retirements, business borrowing would be expected to con-
tinue at about the pace of earlier this year. In the household sector,
mortgage borrowing is likely to continue near the pace of the last few
quarters as home sales are anticipated to hold close to recent levels for
several months, especially to the extent that interest rates stabilize or
ease off under alternative B. Consumer credit growth may pick up tempo-
rarily early next year if, as expected, auto makers step up their sales
promotions to boost demand. The federal government is expected to increase
further its issuance of coupon securities, now that the Treasury has long-
bond authority, but as seasonal financing needs ease with a pickup of tax
receipts, the Treasury is expected to lessen net bill issuance. State and
local government offerings are likely to stay relatively subdued, though any
tendency for rates to drop under this alternative might foster a renewed
interest in refunding outstanding debt.
","alternative B"
1989-05-16,13,"(13) The tightening of policy under alternative C would be a
considerable surprise to financial markets, and would likely induce a
substantial-backup in rates. Increases in short-term interest rates could
exceed the nearly 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate, as
the market reassessed the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy. If
such a tightening were not followed by stronger economic data, risk premi-
ums on private paper might widen further, as worries spread about a pos-
sible recession and its effect on credit quality. Long-term Treasury
rates likely would rise, at least initially, but by less than yields on
corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities; over time, any rate
increase might be reversed if such a policy came to be seen as raising the
odds on disinflation. Additional upward pressure on the dollar would
emerge from the higher U.S. real interest rates, absent similar tightening
actions abroad.
","alternative C"
1989-08-22,13,"(13) Although passage of thrift legislation should bolster depos-
itor confidence and forestall some thrift deposit outflows, the substitu-
tion of RTC funds (not in the aggregates) for deposits and other liabili-
ties, along with discouragement of asset expansion at thrifts, are

expected on balance to damp growth of the broader aggregates.2 The
restraining effect might be particularly evident in the period just ahead
owing to the inducement for the RTC to spend $20 billion by the end of
September. Most of those funds are likely to replace current S&L liabili-
ties, with particular focus on high-yielding liabilities. With respect to
M2, premia on offering rates on small time deposits at insolvent thrifts
should decline, with a more general softening of deposit rates possible at
both banks and thrifts as competitive pressures become less intense.3  In
response to the higher opportunity costs on deposits, some portion of the
funds withdrawn is likely to be transferred by the public into investments
outside M2. This would be particularly true of brokered deposits, which
often are of high denomination ($80,000 to $100,000) and may be held by
especially rate-sensitive investors. Partly as a consequence, M2 growth
under alternative B is projected to slow from around 8 percent in August
to 6 percent in September, with the resolution impact accounting for per-
haps as much as 1 percentage point of the moderation. Moreover, the
rebound in market rates since their lows in late July has widened oppor-
tunity costs, which will also tend to damp M2 growth.
","alternative B"
1989-10-03,13,"(13) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates are likely
to fall in tandem with the 50 basis point drop in the funds rate. The
dollar would decline, and the decline might be substantial if the Federal
Reserve's action were interpreted as a willingness to use monetary policy
to bring about a depreciation of the dollar. Bond rates probably would
move lower, though by less than short-term rates. Limiting the response
of bonds might be a sense that following the unanticipated easing of
policy, the economy could be a little stronger than previously expected in
dollar were particularly sharp. The decline in rates would tend to boost
M2 growth to a somewhat faster pace than in August and September. Early
next year, the continuing effects of the further decline in opportunity
costs, along with a tendency for income growth to begin to strengthen,
likely would result in growth of M2 at a rate above the Committee's tenta-
tive range for 1990. M3 growth would strengthen to a 5 percent rate over
the September-to-December period under alternative A.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1989-11-14,13,"(13) M3 growth under alternative B will continue to be damped by
the ongoing shedding of assets by undercapitalized S&Ls and by funds
supplied through RTC resolutions. However, M3 is expected to grow in
November and December a bit faster than in October, leaving expansion over
the last three months of the year at a 4-1/2 percent rate. The pace of
decline in S&L assets is expected to wane a little over the next two
months from the extremely rapid pace of the last few months, and RTC
resolutions should slow after the fiscal year-end spurt. As a
consequence, outflows of large time deposits and term RPs at thrifts
should abate somewhat. Commercial bank credit is likely to slow but
expansion of managed liabilities will be maintained, in part to compensate
for reduced RTC funds of thrift deposit transfers. Growth of domestic
nonfinancial debt is expected to moderate to around 7 percent over the
rest of the year, owing mainly to a slowing of federal government debt.
This would leave the debt aggregate in the fourth quarter 8-1/4 percent
above its year-earlier level, close to the midpoint of its monitoring
","alternative B"
1989-12-18,13,"(13) M3 is expected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate under
alternative B, in line with its faster pace of October and November.
Growth of this aggregate may decelerate over the quarter, damped by run-
offs of assets at capital-deficient thrifts as well as by a resumption of
RTC activity at insolvent institutions. Credit growth at banks should
remain close to the pace of recent months; these institutions will con-
tinue to fill some of the void in residential and consumer installment
lending and acquisitions of mortgage securities caused by the withdrawal
of the thrift industry.
","alternative B"
1990-03-27,13,"(13) M3 growth under alternative B is projected at a 4 percent
pace, somewhat higher than the December-to-March rate of advance. The
acceleration primarily owes to some pickup in bank credit growth from
reflecting a resumption of business lending; as a consequence, the decline
in large time deposits at commercial banks should cease. In addition, the
runoff of the term Eurodollar component of this aggregate is likely to
ebb. Greater RTC activity would tend to hold down M3 growth to the extent
that such activity necessitated additional government borrowing; the
expenditure of funds previously borrowed by the Treasury would not affect
M3 because such funds are already on deposit at commercial banks. Thrifts
are assumed to continue trimming their large time deposits at about the 25
percent annual rate of the first quarter, while their runoffs of term RPs
abate a bit because the outstanding stock of these liabilities has fallen
to a rather low level.
is projected to record a 4-3/4 percent annual rate of change from March
to June, compared with the 10 percent increase from December to March.
","alternative B"
1990-08-21,13,"(13) Under alternative B, M3 over August and September is pro-
jected to expand at a 3-1/2 percent average rate, implying growth of 2-1/2
percent from June to September. The pickup in M3 does not reflect a pro-
jected acceleration in credit at depository institutions. Rather, it re-
flects some strength in elements of this aggregate that are not direct
funding sources to such institutions--money market mutual funds and term-
Eurodollar deposits.5 Bank lending is projected to stay subdued as banks
continue to exercise extra caution in extending credit, while thrift
balance sheets will shrink further, especially as RTC activities pick up
over the balance of the quarter. Even so, the debt of nonfederal sectors

is projected to continue to grow at a 6 percent rate over the third
quarter, about in line with nominal income. Federal debt growth, on the
other hand, is expected to balloon to a 14 percent annual rate over the
three months, as RTC working capital needs boost federal marketable
borrowing to a record $68 billion level (n.s.a.). Total domestic non-
financial debt growth as a consequence is projected at 7-3/4 percent over
the three months, keeping this aggregate around the midpoint of its annual
","alternative B"
1990-10-02,13,"(13) The tightening of monetary policy under alternative C would
be seen under current circumstances as signalling an aggressive stance
against the inflationary consequences of the oil shock. Such a tightening
is not anticipated by market participants. Given concerns about financial
fragility, yields on private obligations could rise significantly, while
the increase in bill rates could be limited by greater demands for safe
assets. Perceptions that the central bank would not permit inflation to
rise permanently as a result of the oil shock would hold down any increase
in yields on longer-term instruments.
","alternative C"
1990-11-13,13,"(13) Under alternative B, M2 probably would strengthen, but only
a bit--to a 1-3/4 percent rate over November and December. Its M1 com-
ponent is projected to resume expanding over the final two months of the
year, boosted by some bounceback of transactions deposits owing to a
lagged response to the previous reduction in opportunity costs and the
effect of declining market rates on compensating balance requirements. On
a quarterly average basis, M2 would grow at a 2-3/4 percent rate, appre-
ciably faster than nominal GNP in the staff forecast but well below pro-
jections of standard money demand models. The strengthening of M2 would
be expected to extend into the first quarter, with this aggregate above
the lower end of its provisional 1991 range. Under alternative A, the
drop in opportunity costs would boost M2 to a 2-3/4 percent rate over the

final two months of the year and put it in the middle portion of its new
range in the first quarter. The firming in M2 growth under alternative C
would be quite modest and this aggregate would be entering the new year
around the lower end of its tentative 1991 range.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1990-12-18,13,"(13) With the easing of the funds rate by 1/2 percentage point
under alternative A, other short-term market rates would decline, but by
smaller amounts given current market expectations. However, the prime
rate likely would be reduced, perhaps promptly, by the full 1/2 percentage
point. The policy easing also might make lenders a bit more willing to
extend credit to marginal borrowers, in part as lower interest rates im-
prove the economic outlook and borrowers' prospective creditworthiness.
Bond yields would continue to move lower, but the extent of the rally
would depend in part on the reaction in foreign exchange markets. The
dollar would decline, especially if investors saw the action, coming on
the heels of recent easing moves, as evidence of an inclination toward a
more aggressive easing posture by the Federal Reserve. The reaction of
foreign exchange and other financial markets to alternative A may depend
on how it is implemented. However, any tendency for a discount rate cut
to have an independent announcement effect would be muted in the current
circumstances, given perceptions that for technical reasons an easing of
this magnitude would necessarily involve a discount rate cut.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1991-03-26,13,"(13) Under alternative B, M2 would expand at about a 5-1/2
percent rate over the March-to-June period, in line with its December-to-
March growth, placing it a little above the midpoint of its 1991 range.
Expansion of money will continue to be boosted by previous declines in

market interest rates, but these effects will be less over the second
quarter than over the first.5  On the other hand, the projected pickup in
nominal spending will be working to buoy M2 growth over coming months. As
in recent months, most of the increase in M2 will occur in the form of
inflows to liquid retail balances, owing to their narrow opportunity
costs, as offering rates come down only a bit in response to recent
declines in market rates. Growth in small time deposits, by contrast,
should continue anemic, given the much larger adjustment of the rates on
these deposits to declines in market yields.
","alternative B"
1991-05-14,13,"(13) Because the immediate 1/2 percentage point drop in the
federal funds rate under alternative A would come as a surprise to finan-
cial market participants, most of it would be passed through to other
short-term market interest rates, and the prime rate likely would be
reduced again. Bond yields are likely to decline in response, especially
if this action were seen as signalling the Federal Reserve's assessment
that the economic situation was worsening or price pressures were sub-
stantially reduced. However, with this easing coming on the heels of the
recent discount rate reduction, alternative A would be seen as especially
aggressive and could arouse concerns about the expected downward trajec-
tory for inflation unless softness in the economy or prices were confirmed
by subsequent data. With quality spreads already having narrowed con-
siderably, any further decline in private interest rates relative to Trea-
sury yields is likely to be quite limited. The exchange value of the
dollar would tend to adjust downward; this movement would be limited to
the extent the upward pressure on foreign currencies, against a backdrop
of a general softening in economic performance abroad, occasioned a
relaxation of monetary policy in some major trading partners.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1991-08-20,13,"(13) The easing of monetary policy under alternative A would
boost M2 to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate of expansion in September and
the pace would firm further in the fourth quarter, lifting growth of
this aggregate for the year to around 3 percent. Pacing M2 next month
would be an 8-1/2 percent rate of growth in its M1 component and more
rapid expansion in its other liquid deposits, whose opportunity costs
would diminish still further. The opening of even larger intermedia-
tion spreads on some credits would enhance bank efforts to raise capi-
tal and encourage bankers to pursue more lending opportunities. With
a little more bank credit to fund and larger inflows to institution-
only money funds, M3 would pick up to a 2-1/2 percent pace in Septem-
ber and remain around that rate early in the fourth quarter.
Directive Language
","alternative A"
1991-10-01,13,"(13) Under alternative B, growth in M3 from September to
December is expected to strengthen to a 1-1/2 percent annual rate.
The runoff of commercial bank loans posted over the third quarter is
forecast to cease over the fourth quarter. With the strengthening of
bank capital positions progressing, and the default risk on some loan
applicants tempered by improving income prospects, bank lending terms
and conditions should remain stable and perhaps even start to ease a
little. Bank funding needs would be bolstered, cutting into the
paydown of their managed liabilities. The contraction of thrift
balance sheets, however, is likely to continue unabated in the fourth
quarter, in association with sustained heavy RTC activity, assuming
congressional appropriation of requested funding. Large time deposits
would still run off, albeit at a slower pace than over recent months,
and M3 expansion would continue to be lower than growth of M2.
","alternative B"
1991-11-05,13,"(14) Under alternative A, M3 would expand at a 1-1/4 percent
rate in November and December, on a trajectory to begin the new year
within its tentative range. Buoying M3 would be heightened inflows to
institution-only money market funds, whose holders would respond to
the temporary improvement in their yields relative to those of money
market instruments. In addition, banks' needs for M3 liabilities
would be raised by a little additional lending. Improvement in some
lending margins and firmer asset values would enhance access of many
banks to capital and funding markets and encourage lending to some
previously marginal credits. Nevertheless, the major credit-market
beneficiaries of the easing would continue to be those more highly
rated credits having ready access to the commercial paper and capital

(More detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following
pages.) Growth in the broader aggregates is expected to continue at a
rather slow pace in coming months. Under alternative B, both M2 and M3
are projected to be only somewhat above the lower edges of their tenta-
tive 1992 target cones in March. Even under the lower short-term inter-
est rates associated with alternative A, these aggregates probably would
remain noticeably below the midpoints of their ranges.

1992-02-04,13,"(13) The table below presents three alternative sets of
ranges for growth of money and credit over 1992. (Appendix B gives
the ranges and outcomes for money and debt growth since 1979.) Alter-
native I represents the provisional ranges selected by the Committee
last July, which are identical to those used in 1991. The staff projec-
tions for M2, M3, and debt all are in the lower halves of these ranges.
Alternative II allows for a tighter policy stance, lowering each of the
ranges 1/2 percentage point. This alternative could be interpreted as
according with the more restrictive longer-run strategy II of the pre-
vious section, which involves money growth 1 percentage point slower
than in the extended staff projection. Any of the alternatives would
accommodate strategy III, but the thrust of that easier strategy would
be particularly consistent with the 1/2-percentage-point increase in the
ranges that define alternative III. An optional targeting approach,
which involves linking this year's target ranges to last year's ranges
rather than to the actual outcomes, also is discussed in this section.
","alternative c"
1992-03-31,13,"(13) As a consequence of rising opportunity costs and waning
effects of special factors, M2 velocity is projected to increase sig-
nificantly in the second quarter--at about a 2 percent annual rate under
alternative B. The modest deceleration of M2 embodied in this alterna-
tive is expected to be consistent with the greenbook forecast of a con-
tinued pickup in the economy. With credit flows concentrated in longer-
term markets, depositories will remain fairly unaggressive bidders for
deposits, and households will continue to direct savings to capital
market instruments. In these circumstances, the staff is forecasting a
under the greenbook forecast, the same change in velocity as was fore-
cast in February. For the year, M2 now would be expected to increase
around 4 percent, a little faster than projected in February in line
with stronger projected nominal GDP.
","alternative B"
1992-05-19,13,"(13) Growth of M2 is projected to average 2-1/2 percent at an
annual rate over May and June with the essentially stable money market
interest rates of alternative B. Most of the pickup should stem from
the liquid components, as outflows to cover tax payments prove to be
smaller than implicitly anticipated by seasonal factors. In particular,
Ml is likely to return to a double-digit pace over May and June, led by
a sharp reacceleration of demand and other checkable deposits. Even
so, M2 growth from March to June would be only 1 percent, as would its
growth on a quarterly-average basis, far below the staff's projected
pace of 5 percent for nominal GDP. The staff believes that M2 velocity
will continue to increase in coming quarters but at a much slower rate
as the unusual factors inducing the current quarter's increase in M2
velocity wane. For the year as a whole, V2 is projected to be up about

","alternative B"
1992-08-18,13,"(13) The firming in M2 under alternative B shows through in
part to M3, which bottoms out in coming months and then edges higher.
Acting to limit any pickup in this aggregate is the likelihood of
anemic advances in bank credit and funding needs and some further
declines in thrift credit. The failure of M3 to grow this year, as
implied in all the alternatives, would be unprecedented in the
official series, which begins in 1959. The extraordinary behavior of
M3 is a function not only of weak depository credit but of restrained
credit growth overall. With spending financed out of higher profits
and by drawing down liquid assets, the debt of nonfederal sectors is
projected to expand at only a 2-3/4 percent pace over the balance of
the year, implying a further drop in debt-to-income ratios for both
households and businesses. Continued strong federal borrowing will
boost total debt growth to 4-3/4 percent for the year--near the lower
end of its annual monitoring range.
","alternative B"
1992-12-22,13,"(13) The lower interest rates of alternative A would boost M2
growth well into 1993, putting this aggregate near the lower end of the
current provisional range by March. This alternative would also improve
the odds that growth of the aggregates in 1993 would be within the pro-
visional target ranges later in the year as the lower interest and ex-
change rates boosted income relative to the staff forecast. Much of the
higher money growth over coming months relative to alternative B would
reflect stronger expansion of M1. Compensating balances would increase
further, and NOW accounts would rise more quickly. However, deposi-
tories are likely again to be fairly prompt in adjusting liquid deposit
rates, limiting the impact of the policy easing on the monetary aggre-
gates. Bank credit is unlikely to respond very strongly to lower rates,
and additional needs for funds would be met from core deposits. With
issuance of managed liabilities weak, growth in M3 would be boosted only
slightly as compared with alternative B, and that aggregate would remain
below its provisional target range in March.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative B"
1993-03-23,13,"(14) Under alternative A, M2 would strengthen to a 3 percent
rate over the February-to-June period. This speed-up in M2 growth,
coming mainly from its M1 component, would owe to smaller opportunity
costs, as deposit rate adjustments lag behind the decline in market
rates. Although M2 in June would still be below the lower bound of its
annual growth cone, it would be on a trajectory to reach the vicinity of
the lower bound by year-end, partly because spending would begin to
strengthen later in the year in response to the policy easing. M3 would
grow at a 1-1/4 percent pace over February to June under alternative A,
but would remain below its fourth-quarter base even by June. Under
alternative C, M2 would expand at a 2 percent rate over the February-to-
June period, as wider opportunity costs would discourage inflows to more
liquid deposits, especially M1 balances. M2 likely would not move above
the level of its fourth-quarter base until June, and with slower
spending growth later in the year, this aggregate probably would
increase only marginally over the year as a whole. M3 would expand at
only a 3/4 percent rate from February to June.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative C"
1993-05-18,13,"(13) Under alternative B, M2 is projected to increase at about
a 5-3/4 percent average rate over May and June, a considerable pickup
from recent months.6  Some of the strength in May, and to a lesser
extent in June, reflects reversals of previous temporary depressants
involving tax effects, the late-winter lull in mortgage refinancing
activity, and seasonal-adjustment distortions.7 Apart from effects
of these temporary factors, underlying M2 probably will exhibit a speed-
up over the two months, owing to an abatement of the more fundamental
influences that had boosted its velocity to a 5-3/4 percent growth rate
over the previous two quarters. Quarterly average growth of M2 for the
second quarter is projected at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, with
temporary factors having little net impact. Thus, with nominal GDP
expected to rise at about a 4-1/4 percent rate, M2 velocity would
increase at only about a 2-1/2 percent pace. If the money market condi-
tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer, M2 growth
would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal GDP in the
third quarter.
","alternative B"
1993-08-17,13,"(13) The tightening of policy under alternative C would come
much sooner than is now envisioned by market participants. As a conse-
quence, rates at the short end would increase by the half-point boost in
the federal funds rate. The prime rate would rise, likely by one-half
point, although a quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate might
not elicit any change in the prime rate. Intermediate-term rates, both
nominal and real, would move higher, with the extent of the increase
depending on whether market participants viewed the action as merely
moving forward the current trajectory of expected rate increases or as a
fundamentally more aggressive posture that was more certain to achieve
price stability. Perceptions of a firmer stance against inflation would
put some downward pressure on more distant forward rates, muting the
likely rise in bond yields. In any case, the dollar would move higher
on foreign exchange markets.
","alternative C"
1993-09-21,13,"(13) Alternative C might be favored if the modest degree
of price deceleration in the staff forecast were viewed to be unsatis-
factory. Tighter money market conditions might also be sought if the
Committee were concerned that low nominal and real short-term rates
were fostering runups in capital market prices that were unsustain-
able, risking either excessive stimulus to spending and inflation down
the road or a sharp correction in financial markets with potential
systemic implications. M2 under this alternative is projected to grow
at a 1-1/2 percent rate over the final four months of the year,
restrained primarily by higher opportunity costs and less robust
mortgage refinancings. M2 growth could be faster than this if
declines in bond and stock prices prompted a reassessment of the
relative risks of deposits and capital market instruments. M3 would
expand at only a 1/2 percent rate over this period, held down in part
by sizable outflows from institution-only money market funds. These
growth rates would place both aggregates near the bottom of their
annual ranges for this year, and on a lower trajectory going into 1994
than under alternative B, partly reflecting damped income growth.
Directive Language
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1993-11-16,13,"(13) Alternative A might be viewed as appropriate if the Com-
mittee wished to make appreciable progress in reducing remaining slack
in the economy, in contrast to the plateau for the unemployment rate
seen in the staff forecast. Lower short rates might also be seen as
desirable if the Committee were concerned about the possibility of
renewed weakness in economic growth over coming quarters, perhaps
brought on by tax increases becoming effective in 1994. This alterna-
tive would provide somewhat greater assurance that growth of the broad
monetary aggregates would be well within their annual ranges in the
first half of next year. Although the steeper yield curve under alter-
native A would make bond and stock funds more attractive, experience of
the last few years suggests some net shift of funds from market instru-
ments to M2 in the months following monetary policy easings. Thus, the
staff projects that M2 in March would be 3-1/4 percent at an annual rate
above its fourth-quarter base, a little above the middle of its tenta-
tive range, and M3 would be higher by 2 percent, around the middle of
its range.
Directive Language
","Alternative A"
1993-12-21,13,"(13) The easing of policy under alternative A would come as
a surprise to market participants, and short-term interest rates would
fall by about the 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate.
Intermediate- and long-term rates would decline by less; indeed, the
extent of any decline would be quite limited if the easing were seen
by market participants to be unsustainable. The dollar would weaken
on foreign exchange markets. Under alternative A, M2 would expand at
a 2-1/4 percent pace, close to that evident since midyear, buoyed
partly by less of a slowdown in M1 than under alternatives B and C,
M3 would grow at a 1-1/4 percent pace from November to March.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1994-05-17,13,"(13) The case for increasing the intended federal funds rate
only 25 basis points as under alternative C would seem to hinge on the
judgment that financial market participants have exaggerated the like-
ly strength of future spending relative to the economy's potential and
hence of prospective inflation pressures. In this view, taking the
fundamentals reasonably into account, the markets have gotten ""ahead
of the curve"" and the risk of disappointing them should not be allowed
to divert the Federal Reserve from a gradual course of 25-basis-point
adjustments in the stance of policy toward neutrality. With the loca-
tion of a neutral funds rate itself a moving target--and lower to the
extent that real long-term interest rates are higher--such an approach
would allow more time to assess the needed federal funds rate in-
creases as new information on the economy and prices becomes avail-
able. Short-term rates likely would edge off immediately after a
modest policy tightening. The initial reaction in capital and foreign
exchange markets could be adverse if the small size of the move were
seen as signalling a reluctance to move aggressively to head off an
inflationary buildup. However, the odds on such a reaction may have
been reduced by the recent favorable price data. In this context,
market participants might be more inclined to interpret the smaller
move as sufficient to counter coming inflation pressures and to
project a lower trajectory of short-term rates, which would pass
through to lower longer-term rates.
","alternative C"
1994-09-27,13,"(13) Growth of the monetary aggregates over the September-
to-December period is presented below for alternatives B and D. Any
action taken this late in the year is unlikely to have much of an
impact on the annual growth rates of the aggregates for 1994, shown in
the lower panel of the table. For illustrative purposes, the path
under alternative B was derived assuming that the funds rate would
hold at its current level for the remainder of the year. The path for
the aggregates under alternative D assumes that the funds rate moves
up to 5-1/4 percent at this meeting and stays there for the balance of
the year. Thus, neither alternative matches the assumption in the
Greenbook forecast. (The response of the aggregates under alternative
C would lie midway between the two alternatives.)

1995-03-28,13,"(13) The 50 basis point easing of the federal funds rate
under alternative A also would surprise market participants. Both
long- and short-term rates are likely to fall substantially as a
result, as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Although
the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary credibility has apparently
increased over the last few months, it could begin to erode if incom-
ing data were to indicate that inflation pressures were not abating,
prompting the market to judge that the easing had been unwarranted.
Under those circumstances, long-term rates would begin to retrace
their initial declines, particularly if the dollar came under persist-
ent, intense downward pressure.
","alternative A"
1995-05-23,13,"(13) Short-term market rates under alternative A would like-
ly drop close to one-half percentage point. Long-term markets could
rally further and lower rates would persist, at least until economic
data pointed to a vigorous bounceback in economic activity. The
foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline.
","alternative A"
1995-08-22,13,"(13) Alternative C would come as a surprise to market par-
ticipants, and money market interest rates would rise at least 50
basis points and the dollar would strengthen further on foreign ex-
change markets. Intermediate- and long-term rates also would in-
crease, with the extent of the rise depending on whether market par-
ticipants saw the action as implying more underlying strength in
aggregate demand and greater inflationary pressure than currently
envisioned or whether this tightening were interpreted as suggesting
more resolve by the Committee to bring inflation down.
","Alternative C"
1995-11-15,13,"(13) The choice of alternative C might be favored to the
extent that the Committee wished to have greater assurance that infla-
tion would continue to edge down. A more restrictive policy to
accomplish this objective might be seen as all the more needed in
light of recent strength in broad measures of output and labor input.
Furthermore, intermediate- and long-term interest rates have declined
substantially in recent months, potentially providing considerable
further impetus to spending.
","alternative C"
1995-12-19,13,"(13) With market participants expecting an easing rather than
a tightening of policy, the 50-basis-point increase in the federal
funds rate under alternative C would lead to a sharp jump in other
money market interest rates. Yields on intermediate- and longer-term
issues would likely rise as well, as real interest rates expected over
coming quarters firmed considerably, and probably by more in the short
run than any decline in inflation expectations. The value of the
dollar on foreign exchange markets would increase appreciably.
","alternative C"
1996-03-26,13,"(13) The 50 basis point tightening of alternative C would
catch market participants unawares and show through to instruments at
the shortest maturities. The response further along the term struc-
ture of interest rates could also be substantial, as the action would
likely be interpreted as suggesting that the Federal Reserve saw con-
siderable inflation risks. Even so, the rise in longer-term rates
likely would reflect a significant real component and the dollar would
tend to increase on exchange markets and stock prices to weaken.
","alternative C"
1996-09-24,13,"(13) In view of slower-than-expected M2 and M3 growth in
recent months, the staff has revised down projected growth for those
aggregates in 1996. M2 is now expected to increase at a 4-1/2 percent
rate this year and M3 at a 5-3/4 percent rate under alternative B,
somewhat below the upper ends of their growth ranges for the year.
Over the August-to-December period, the expansion of M2 is projected
to pick up to about a 4-3/4 percent pace, broadly in line with GDP
growth under alternative B. The pickup in M2 should show through to
M3, and growth in the latter is forecast to strengthen to a 6 percent
rate over the final four months of this year, abetted by a strengthen-
ing of the expansion of bank credit. Continued large sweeps of other
checkable deposits and demand deposits will distort measured M1. In-
deed, M1 is projected to run off at about a 5 percent annual rate over
the August-to-December period, while expansion of sweep-adjusted M1
increases to a 6-1/2 percent rate.

expected to change much under alternative B, maintaining opportunity
costs at around their recent levels. M2 growth over the October-to-
March period is expected to quicken to a 4-1/4 percent rate from the
unexpectedly weak advance in September and October, reflecting the
projected speedup in nominal spending in the staff forecast.4 This
strengthening in M2 does not show through to M3, as banks lessen their
net issuance of managed liabilities, and the broader aggregate is seen
as expanding at a 6-1/4 percent pace over the next five months. The
implied growth of M2 for 1996 as a whole is 4 percent, in the upper
half of its range, compared with a 4-1/2 percent rate projected in the
September bluebook. The growth of M3 for the year is projected at 6

1996-12-17,13,"(13) Because the market is not expecting a change in policy, a 50 basis point
funds rate reduction, as in alternative A, would show through completely to other
short-term rates. The market would probably interpret the action as signaling that the
Committee saw inflation risks as considerably less pressing than previously thought.
This view would have credence given the Federal Reserve's current reputation for
anticipating economic developments, and hence real and nominal interest rates likely
would decline along the maturity spectrum, the exchange rate would drop, and the
stock market would move higher, providing an impetus for spending over the inter-
mediate run. The decline in nominal yields on longer-term instruments might be
somewhat muted, or ultimately even reversed, were incoming data to turn out more

of financing between deposits and non-deposit funding sources. From February to June, M3

1997-12-16,13,"(13) The 25 basis point easing of Alternative A might be favored if the Committee
were concerned that turmoil abroad might have an even greater impact on the U.S. economy
than the staff has built into the forecast. Given the favorable near-term inflation outlook for
the United States, the Committee might see insurance against such an outcome to be
relatively inexpensive in that the easing likely could be reversed, if that proved necessary,
before it boosted inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, such an easing, by lowering
real dollar interest rates might contribute a little toward stabilizing foreign markets, helping to
forestall some repercussions in the United States. Moreover, the recent weakness in
commodity prices and the shallow slope of the yield curve may support the view that real
short-term rates are high relative to their equilibrium.
","Alternative A"
1998-03-31,13,"(13) Short-term rates would rise by the full amount of the 25 basis point tightening
of policy under alternative C, which is unanticipated in the market. Intermediate- and longer-
term real interest rates would also rise substantially as markets reassessed their view of the
Federal Reserve's forecast and, perhaps, intentions, and the dollar could come under upward
pressure. Stock prices could well decline, especially if investors saw the tightening as
worsening the outlook for corporate earnings as well as raising the rate of discount applied to
future earnings, and such a decrease would be one element of the necessary restraint on
aggregate demand. The generally healthy state of financial institutions in the United States
would seem to suggest that the domestic financial system would be resilient to any fall in
asset values that were to accompany such a policy tightening. Most likely, financial markets
in troubled emerging economies would not be greatly affected if the action were seen as
limited and not portending a more generalized upward movement in rates in industrial
","alternative C"
1998-05-19,13,"(13) Under the stable money market conditions of alternative B, the staffs projected
of this year should be associated with a noticeable slowdown in the expansion of the debt and
monetary aggregates. Household borrowing should slow along with spending on consumer
durables and houses, and business demand for credit should subside as inventory investment
downshifts substantially. Still, the debt of both sectors is expected to exceed the expansion of
income, with the upturn in debt-servicing burdens held down by recent and continuing
refinancing of outstanding higher-cost obligations. While slower economic growth and
narrower profit margins may make lenders a little more cautious, a significant restriction in
credit availability does not appear likely, given the healthy financial condition of both
borrowers and lenders. In the federal sector, outstanding debt should run off, even on a
seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting the government's widening budget surplus. From April to
September, the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is foreseen as slowing to a 4-1/2 percent
annual rate, bringing its average advance from the fourth quarter to 5-1/2 percent, somewhat
above the midpoint of its annual range.
","alternative B"
1998-11-17,13,"(13) M2 and M3 are predicted to continue to grow rapidly through the end of the year,
reflecting strong demands for liquidity in the aftermath of the volatile market climate, as well as
in response to the recent policy easings and the expectation in markets of more to come, which
have reduced the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.3 Over 1998 as a whole, M2 and
M3 are projected to expand 9 and 10-3/4 percent, respectively, far overshooting their annual
ranges. In early 1999, however, M2 growth is projected to slow considerably as unusual
demands for liquid assets abate and households redeploy liquid assets previously parked in
money market mutual funds awaiting longer-term investment opportunities. M2 growth,
however, is expected to exceed that of nominal GDP. M3 is forecast to outpace M2 as banks
seek funding through instruments included in the broader aggregate to finance bank credit
expansion and as institution-only money market funds remain attractive investments for
corporate cash managers. Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are projected to expand over the
October-to-March period at annual rates of 8 and 9-1/2 percent, respectively, leaving both
aggregates by March well above the ranges established provisionally for 1999.

1998-12-22,13,"(13) The case for easing further at some point, as in the 1/4 point reduction in the
federal funds rate at this meeting of alternative A, might rest on the view that there are
substantial risks of a shortfall in global demand and of more downward pressure on prices than
the Committee might find desirable. The prospects for Brazil remain fragile, and the lack of
progress in resolving fiscal imbalances in that country may now suggest even higher odds for
problems there that would spread to other emerging markets, feeding back to the United States.
Furthermore, the continuing steep declines in oil and commodity prices may be signalling that
worldwide demand is weaker than expected. Such price declines could themselves feed through
to further reductions in aggregate price measures and inflation expectations, elevating the real
federal funds rate, should the nominal funds rate remain unchanged, and putting upward pressure
on real long-term rates. Higher long-term rates could come at an inopportune time given a
possibly developing overhang in manufacturing capacity. Preemptive action to head off undue
restraint on spending might be viewed as especially appropriate if inflation already were expected
to be consistent with price stability. Indeed, market participants implicitly appear to be putting
some weight on these demand and price risks in that they continue to factor into market quotes
another policy ease by mid-year.
","alternative A"
1999-05-18,13,"(13) Abstracting from the estimated effects of refunds and nonwithheld tax
payments in recent months, M2 growth has slowed considerably, even relative to the
projected deceleration in nominal spending for the second quarter. Some of the fall-off in
M2 growth has likely been temporary, reflecting the recovery of financial markets and the
unwinding of the general buildup of liquidity that occurred in the last several months of
projected to pick up in the months ahead under alternative B, extending the trend decline in
velocity evident since mid-1997, and leaving growth of this aggregate for the year at about 6
percent, somewhat above its annual range of 1 to 5 percent. The recent sluggish behavior of
bank credit also appears to reflect an unwinding of the developments of last fall; as bank
credit growth steps up in the months ahead, banks should again need to turn to managed
liabilities for financing, and M3 growth should rebound as well. For 1999 as a whole, M3 is
projected to post a 6-1/2 percent growth rate, placing it a little above its annual range of 2 to 6

1999-08-24,13,"(13) Recent data on the monetary aggregates have provided little in the way of
surprise. Going forward, the effect on M2 growth of the slightly firmer money market rates
for the second half of the year foreseen in the Greenbook is about offset by the slightly
stronger cast to expected spending. Under alternative B, M2 is expected to grow at a 6-1/4
percent pace over the five months from July to December. Over the last two quarters of
the year, projected M2 velocity is about flat. The staff M2 forecast embodies modest
dislocations associated with the century date change, which on net should give a fillip to
money growth owing to a late-year shift toward currency and insured deposits from
investments outside M2. M3 is expected to be buoyed by these effects and by a pickup in
bank credit induced by precautionary borrowing, pushing M3 growth over the July-to-
December period up to 7 percent. The staff anticipates that both aggregates will end the
year above their annual ranges. The firming in policy under alternative C occurs late enough
this year to impart only slight restraint on the aggregates in 1999.

1999-11-16,13,"(13) While financial markets are somewhat illiquid, confidence about Y2K
preparedness and procedures to contain systemic problems has been growing, suggesting
that the 1/4 percentage point firming at this meeting under alternative C--although a bit of a
surprise--would be unlikely to create undue strains. The response of key financial prices
would depend importantly on the type of tilt and the wording of the announcement. An
asymmetric directive and words emphasizing continuing inflation risks over a longer time
period would impart to market participants the impression that further tightening moves
could well be in store beginning fairly early next year. In that case, an appreciable backup in
bond yields, sell-off of stocks, and strengthening of the exchange value of the dollar could
be anticipated. In contrast, a symmetric directive and an announcement suggesting that the
Committee could well stay its hand for some time could lead market participants to mark
down their expectations for cumulative monetary policy tightening and reduce their
uncertainty about near-term actions. In such a case, bond and stock prices could dip only

1999-12-21,13,"(13) After its Y2K-related runup late in the year, expansion of the monetary
aggregates is expected to moderate substantially over the first few months of the new year.
Currency growth should slow sharply. Similarly, the recent surge in large time deposits
should substantially unwind, as bank credit growth settles down from its Y2K-related bulge
and depository institutions return to more typical funding patterns. M2 also should
continue to respond to the earlier tightenings in the stance of monetary policy and the
associated widening in the opportunity cost of holding retail monetary assets. From
December to March, M2 and M3 are projected to grow at 4 and 3-3/4 percent annual rates,
respectively under alternative B. Measured over the October-to-March period to abstract
from most Y2K influences, M2 is forecast to expand at a 5-1/2 percent rate under that
alternative. This growth would leave this aggregate in March at the upper end of its
provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range. M3 is projected to expand at an 8-1/2 percent pace
over the same period, placing it in March somewhat above its provisional 2 to 6 percent
annual range.
Directive Language
","alternative B"
2000-11-15,13,"(13) While money market futures embed the expectation of policy easing at some
point, market participants do not anticipate such action at this meeting, in part because after
its previous meeting the Committee stated that it continued to view the risks as weighted
toward higher inflation. Adoption of alternative A, therefore, would trigger a rally in bond
and stock markets, though the extent would depend on the accompanying statement of the
balance of risks. If the Committee announced that it believes the risks to be in balance,
investors could well interpret the easing as mostly bringing forward in time policy actions
they had already anticipated, attenuating price gains. If the Committee instead announced a
view that risks are weighted toward economic weakness, the rally in the Treasury market
would be more vigorous as investors came to expect a larger cumulative policy easing. The
Federal Reserve's evident concerns about a slowing economy and deteriorating financial
conditions might lead investors to become more worried about repayment prospects, causing
risk spreads to widen some. However, the Committee's willingness to act would likely
reassure market participants that downside risks would be limited.
","alternative A"
2004-05-04,13,"(13) While the Committee might find some encouragement in the stronger
tone of recent economic data, it may not yet be convinced that the expansion has
become self-sustaining and may still expect inflation to remain low.  In early 2002, for
instance, the expansion appeared to be gaining traction for a time and market
expectations about the onset of tightening were building, but the expansion
subsequently faltered.  If the Committee believed that the case for tighter policy
would likely require at least several more months of evidence, it might choose a
statement fairly close to the one released following the March meeting, as in
Alternative A.  With investment spending still reported to be primarily for
replacement rather than for expansion and with only one month of reasonably strong
employment data in hand, the Committee may not yet be confident that business
gloom has really lifted all that much.  Indeed, with the impetus to both household and
business spending from expansionary fiscal policy expected to wane over coming
quarters and financial conditions having tightened considerably of late, some members
may be concerned that growth could fall back more than in the staff projection.  The
recent uptick in inflation might be seen as primarily the result of temporary factors
and, therefore, leaving open the possibility that the underlying trend in inflation could
edge lower (much as is discussed in the Inflation Reversal simulation in the
Greenbook).  Moreover, some Committee members might see the level of inflation
over the past year as at the low end of its desirable range over the longer term and so
may not be averse to a modest step-up.  Against this backdrop, the Committee may
continue to view downside surprises to inflation as more costly than upside surprises,
implying that a cautious approach to monetary policy tightening remains appropriate.
","Alternative A"
2004-06-29,13,"(13) If the Committee finds the staff analysis in the Greenbook compelling
and the forecasted outcome about the best available in current circumstances, it might
implement the 25 basis point firming of Alternative B.  Any earlier concerns the
Committee may have harbored about the sustainability of the expansion probably
have been assuaged by recent economic indicators, including the past few
employment releases and anecdotal information such as that contained in the June
Beigebook.  Meanwhile, inflation has run on the high side of lateabove both staff
projections made early this year and the Committees expectations for 2004 revealed
in the central tendency projections published in the February Monetary Policy Report. 
Moreover, according to a wide range of estimates, the current real federal funds rate is
distinctly below its likely equilibrium value (Chart 7) and also lies below the
prescriptions from a variety of policy rules (Chart 8).  In view of these considerations,
the Committee may feel that the time has come to begin returning the real federal
funds rate to a more neutral level.  At the same time, the Committee might prefer to
start the process gradually with a 25-basis-point move at this meeting so as to
promote an orderly transition to a tightening cycle in financial markets, particularly
given the widespread interpretation in markets of the Committees measured
language.  Such a modest move would also be favored if the Committee, like the staff,
sees underlying inflation as still low and a considerable degree of slack remaining in
resource markets.
","Alternative B"
2004-08-10,13,"(13) The announcement accompanying a decision to leave rates unchanged
could point to the evidence of a moderation in output growth and possibly, as mentioned
above, a slowing in the pace of improvement in labor market conditions.  The
inflation sentence could well be similar to that under Alternative B.  If FOMC
members are especially concerned that the recent weakness in spending might prove
persistent, they might consider an assessment that risks to sustainable growth are
weighted to the downside.  However, the Committee may judge that, especially given
the easing of market interest rates that would likely accompany an unchanged policy
stance, the risks to both sustainable growth and price stability would remain in
balance.  Assuming that the Committee still sees a need to move over time toward a
neutral stance, it probably would want to retain in the announcement the judgment
that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace.  Consistent with
its motivation for selecting Alternative A, the Committee might also wish to note that
policy will be adjusted as appropriate to promote sustainable growth as well as price
stability in the last sentence of the risk assessment section.
","Alternative B, Alternative A"
2004-11-10,13,"(13) The announcement of Alternative C could cite the increase in the target rate
to 2 percent with no intimation of a pause any time soon.  The stance of policy might
still be characterized simply as accommodative and the rationale paragraph might note
that rising energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to contribute to
upward pressure on prices so as to highlight concerns about inflation.  The Committee
could retain the measured pace language and might also continue to assess the risks to
growth and price stability as balanced, particularly if it viewed that assessment as
conditioned on an assumption of appropriate policy.
","Alternative C"
2004-12-14,13,"(13) The Committee may believe that, as in the Greenbook forecast, fostering
sustainable economic growth and price stability will likely involve continued policy
tightening but at a less rapid pace going forward than has been the case over the past
six months.  For example, members may expect only gradual diminution of the
business caution that has damped the economic expansion over the last few years
despite unusually accommodative monetary policy.  If the Committee held such a
view, it might want to couple a 25-basis-point move at this meeting with a statement
like that in Alternative B, which is intended to signal the possibility of a pause in the
adjustment of policy before long.  While an additional hike in rates at this meeting
would be consistent with a number of standard policy rules (Chart 6), some of those
rules also suggest a pause fairly soon if output and inflation evolve as projected in the
Greenbook.  Indeed, another 25 basis points of tightening at this meeting would bring

","Alternative B"
2005-02-01,13,"(13) The third set of simulations illustrates the policy implications of alternative
assumptions about aggregate demand, again assuming a 1½ percent inflation
objective.  The solid lines in Chart 7 are identical to those in the previous two charts,
depicting the benchmark scenario in which the personal saving rate gradually rises
toward its long-run historical average.  In contrast, the dashed lines depict an
alternative scenario in which the saving rate remains at a relatively low level (similar to
the simulation referred to in the Greenbook as the Stronger Consumption
scenario).  In this case, the long-run equilibrium value of the real funds rate is about
objective, the optimal policy essentially matches this increase in the equilibrium rate
by prescribing a steeper funds rate path that reaches near 4½ percent by late 2007.
This policy response largely offsets the shift in aggregate demand, so that the
trajectories of unemployment and inflation are essentially the same as in the
benchmark scenario.  The dotted lines in this chart depict the alternative scenario in
which the personal saving rate rises even faster than in the benchmark scenario.  In
this case, the optimal policy prescribes a somewhat lower path for the real funds rate
and thereby prevents the negative aggregate demand shock from having a noticeable
impact on unemployment or inflation.
Short-Run Policy Alternatives
","alternative
a"
2005-03-22,13,"(13) The Committee might view recent elevated readings on some price
measures as providing a stronger signal of heightened inflation pressures than does
the staff.  In this case, the Committee may wish to raise the target federal funds rate
by 50 basis points and issue a statement like that described for Alternative C.  This
option might be viewed as particularly appealing if the Committee thought that
underlying productivity growth had slowed substantially or that output was already
approaching, or had even outstripped, potential.  Even if the Committee generally
believes that inflation and inflation expectations are likely to remain well-contained
under the gradual trajectory of policy tightening assumed in the Greenbook, it may
view the upside risks to that forecastwhich are explored in the spending boom
with rising inflation expectations scenario in the Greenbookas sufficiently
worrisome to justify a half-point move at this meeting.  In light of the apparent
momentum of aggregate demand, the Committee may perceive the risk that market

2005-05-03,13,"(13) Investors appear certain that the Committee will boost the target federal
funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Also, most expect that the FOMC will
not make major changes to its announcement, apart from those necessary to align
the description of economic conditions with newly available information.  While a
growing minority of market participants in recent days have come to expect the
measured pace language to be shed, it is hard to tell whether they would view such
an outcome as a signal of a stepped-up pace of firming or of a pause.  Assuming that
those differing interpretations about offset each other, there is little reason to

2005-06-29,13,"(13) The Committee may see little reason to diverge at this point from its
established precedent of measured policy firming and thus be attracted to
Alternative B.  Although aggregate spending and output growth evidently slowed in
early spring, the economy appears to remain reasonably robust.  Moreover, the recent
evidence may be read as indicating that the pace of expansion is likely to rebound
during the second half of the year to a rate somewhat above that of the growth of
potential output, even with further modest policy tightening.  That outlook is
consistent with staff estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (Chart 7),
which mostly lie well above the current level of the real federal funds rate.
Meanwhile, although recent inflation readings have proven reassuring, further
increases in energy prices and diminishing slack in the economy may be read by

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a models projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core PCE 
price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection 
used for the current quarter.  Since TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, the TIPS-consistent 
measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between CPI inflation and core PCE 
inflation.
Measure Description
Single-Equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date reflects the 
short-term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years. This forward rate is 
adjusted down for a term premium, assumed to be 70 basis points, and adjusted up for the 
difference between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation, projected to be 40 basis 
points in the medium run.

members as posing risks to inflation performance.  With the inflation outlook perhaps
slightly worse than previously anticipated and solid economic expansion seemingly on
track, the Committee may well be inclined to continue its measured pace of firming at
this meeting.  In favoring this over a larger move, members might interpret some
market indicators, including inflation compensation read from TIPS and the
considerable flattening of the nominal yield curve, as suggesting that an aggressive
tightening of policy at this time is not warranted.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2005-08-09,13,"(13) Recognizing that the cumulative tightening put in place over the past year
has substantially reduced the degree of monetary policy accommodation, the
Committee may believe that the real federal funds rate is now nearing its equilibrium
level.  In view of such an assessment as well as the subdued readings on core inflation
in recent months, the FOMC might opt for Alternative As combination of a
Committee could soon slow the pace of policy firming.  This alternative would seem
particularly attractive if members thought that slack in labor markets was greater than
in the staff assessment, implying less need to tighten policy than in the Greenbook.
Even if the Committee believed that it would probably need to tighten policy
somewhat further following a quarter-point step on Tuesday, a near-term pause might
be viewed as prudent to allow more time to evaluate the effects of its cumulative
policy action to date.  A funds rate path incorporating a quarter-point tightening at
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 15 of 35
this meeting followed by a shallower trajectory of tightening would be consistent with
the prescriptions from several policy rules (Chart 6).
","Alternative A"
2005-09-20,13,"(13) At the August meeting, several participants noted that core PCE inflation
was running at the upper end of the range they considered to be consistent with price
stability.  Since then, the staff has marked up its forecast of core inflation for next year
about ¼ percentage point, to 2¼ percent.  Moreover, the edging lower of inflation
thereafter in the projection owes importantly to the assumed gradual decline in energy
prices.  If the Committee saw this inflation outcome as unacceptable or believed that
such an expectation was likely to prove optimistic, then it might view the words of
Alternative B as too timid about the prospects for additional policy tightening.  Such a
concern might well be intensified if significant odds were put on the possibility that
inflation expectations could become unanchored in response to surging energy prices,
perhaps in the manner discussed in the alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  The
likelihood of more tightening than currently built into financial market prices could be
conveyed to the public by shortening the wording for Alternative B that appears in
Table 1.  In particular, the Committee could give less weight to the disruptions from
Hurricane Katrina by striking the second and third sentences and dropping the word
remaining in row 3.8
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
2005-11-01,13,"(13) If the Committee wished to convey greater concern about upside risks to
inflation, it might prefer to combine a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate
with the language included under Alternative C.  The Committee may especially
favor this alternative if increases in energy and other costs were viewed as beginning
to unmoor inflation expectations, potentially starting an upward shift in inflation
dynamics that would be hard to reverse later.  Even if inflation expectations remain
well anchored for a time, a sharper rebound in spending growth as rebuilding in the
hurricane-affected areas picks up steam may put excessive strains on resources.  The
proposed statement drops the characterization of policy as accommodative, but it
indicates in the comments on inflation (row 3) that further policy firming likely is
necessary on the thought that the Committee might soon envision moving the real
funds rate past its neutral levelthat is, to impose policy restraint.  The sentence on
the balance of risks is also eliminated; the Committee might see that formula as
redundant or possibly misleading about the extent of upside inflation risks at present.
The final paragraph on the measured pace language is also dropped, allowing greater
flexibility for possible future adjustments of policy.  The Committee may see this
more forceful tone as warranted in light of the backup in market interest rates,
increase in inflation compensation, and depreciation of the dollar in recent days,
which might be viewed as signs of the emergence of inflation jitters in financial
markets.  Indeed, the Committee may prefer to raise the target funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting in association with language similar to that under Alternative C
to underscore its determination to resist an increase in inflation.

","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2005-12-13,13,"(13) The assessment of risks portion of the statement for Alternative B resolves
some of the complications and tensions that have arisen in the current language.  It
starts by removing the arguably tautological statement that appropriate policy
should keep the risks to sustainable growth and price stability balanced, and it also
drops the indication that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is
likely to be measured.  Instead, the assessment notes that some further measured
policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to both price stability and
sustainable economic growth roughly in balance.  The Committee may find this
formulation attractive because it simplifies the existing wording considerably but does
not greatly change its message regarding the likely near-term path for policy.  If the
Committee continues to expect that policy will be adjusted gradually, almost surely in
increments of 25 basis points, then the retention of the word measured would seem
appropriate.  And the use of the word some would suggest that the Committee
expects that the necessary amount of additional tightening is not large.  Given the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 42
considerable uncertainty about the level of the equilibrium federal funds rate,
members may no longer be confident that policy is accommodative, and so welcome
the deletion of the reference to the removal of policy accommodation here as well as
in the rationale section.  This deletion might seem even more appropriate if members
see a possibility that the federal funds rate will need to be raised above its equilibrium
value in order to keep inflation contained.  As in recent announcements, the
Committee might want to emphasize that policy actions will depend on evolving
economic conditions.  Along these lines, the last sentence in the statement notes that
the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain
price stability and foster sustainable economic growth.
","Alternative B"
2006-01-31,13,"(13) This Bluebook discusses three short-run policy alternatives that are
presented in Table 1.  The target funds rate would be raised 25 basis points under
Alternatives B and C but left unchanged under Alternative A.  Alternative C retains
risk assessment language identical to that used in the December statement on the
notion that this will convey to markets a high likelihood of further firming in March.
The assessment of risks under both Alternatives A and B is intended to soften that
sense by suggesting that policy is likelybut not certainto tighten in the future.
Because the slowing in economic growth in the fourth quarter owed importantly to
swings in federal spending and exports that are thought to be temporary, the
description of the economy in the sentence in row 2 of the table begins with
Smoothing through near-term volatility in spending and production rather than
Despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions for each
alternative.  The sentence then continues by reiterating that the expansion in
economic activity appears solid.

the extent that the Committee views the flat yield curve and narrow risk spreads as
evidence of an optimistic perception of and greater tolerance for risk on the part of
investors, then it may believe that financial conditions remain accommodative.  Given
the judgment that resource slack is limited, members may want to tighten these
conditions somewhat, so as not to risk allowing the economy to overheat.  If so,
members may not be content with simply validating existing expectations for
monetary policy tightening, as in Alternative B, preferring instead to hint at a firmer
path of policy by adopting a more hawkish rationale paragraph, as in Alternative C.
Members may be inclined to this course of action if they are particularly worried
about inflation risks, perhaps because of the possibility that increases in labor and
intermediate material costs could put additional upward pressure on prices, as
discussed in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook, or if they have doubts that
the housing market will in fact cool as much as in the staff forecast, given that
aggregate house price data have so far shown only a slight slowdown in the pace of

Greenbook forecast is both likely and best balances the Federal Reserves dual
objectives, then it may wish to couple another 25 basis point firming at this meeting
with a risk assessment that hints that the tightening cycle may be coming to a close, as
in Alternative B.  A quarter-point move at this meeting would bring the cumulative
tightening since June 2004 to 4 percentage points.  While a portion of that rise has
been offset by higher inflation, real short-term interest rates have been boosted
appreciably as well, from below zero to around 2¾ percent as measured using trailing
core PCE inflation as a proxy for expected inflation.  The real federal funds rate has
been lifted to around the middle of the range of model-based estimates of its short-
run equilibrium (Chart 7) and to a level about equal to the equilibrium rate implicit in
the Greenbook projection.  Members may also view the recent backup in longer-term
rates as augmenting the financial restraint imposed by higher short-term interest rates.

about economic developments before taking 
any further action.  The Committee sees the 
risks to its price stability objective as slightly 
to the upside and judges it more likely that its 
next policy action will be a tightening rather 
than an easing.
To keep the risks to the attainment of 
both sustainable economic growth and 
price stability roughly in balance, some 
further policy firming may be needed.  
The Committee judges that any 
additional firming is likely to be modest.  
However, the extent and timing of any

its objectives of sustainable economic growth

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding models projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staffs estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.
Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

growth to a pace a little below that of its potential, slightly easing pressures on
resources and promoting a modest downward tilt in core inflation to rates below
convinced that output growth would slow to this extent if the funds rate were
maintained at 5 percent, it might nonetheless believe that the stance of policy is not
far from neutral.  If so, a pause in policy firming before long would be unlikely to
jeopardize the Committees price stability objective and might be appropriate to allow
a better assessment at a later date of the cumulative effects of its policy actions.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2006-06-28,13,"(13) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A,
the Committee would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting and
indicate that it would likely stay its hand for at least one more meeting before deciding
whether further tightening was necessary.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would
tighten 25 basis points and signal that an additional tightening in August was possible.
Alternative C combines a 50 basis point increase in the target with a statement
suggesting that additional firming was likely.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2006-08-08,13,"(13) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph in the statement would
indicate that economic growth has moderated, noting the role of the lagged effects of
increases in interest rates and energy prices and of the continuing cooling of the
housing market.  While acknowledging the elevated readings on core inflation, it
would also cite the reasons to expect inflation to decline in coming quarters:
contained inflation expectations, the cumulative effects of past policy firmings, and
other factors restraining aggregate demand.  In its assessment of risks, the Committee
would reiterate its judgment that some upside inflation risks remain and point to the
possibility of additional firming should incoming information warrant such action.
","Alternative B"
2006-12-12,13,"(13) An announcement along the lines of Alternative B is unlikely to prompt a
significant market reaction.  Money market futures and options indicate that investors
assign essentially no probability to a change in the target rate at the December
meeting.  And the Desks survey indicates that the majority of primary dealers expect
that the accompanying statement will not differ significantly from the October
announcement apart from some modest updating of the paragraph characterizing
economic growth, though a minority anticipate language that points to some
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 40
downside risks to the growth outlook while still citing upside risks to inflation.
Although the statement proposed for Alternative B does not explicitly recognize risks
to growth, it seems consistent with the broad thrust of these expectations.
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
2007-05-09,13,"(13) In March, members apparently judged that maintaining the current target
federal funds rate provided the best chance of fostering moderate economic growth
and a gradual ebbing in core inflation.  The incoming data over the intermeeting
period have not altered significantly the staffs assessment of the prospects for growth
and inflation.  If the Committee similarly has not substantially changed its assessment
of the economic outlook, it may be attracted to Alternative B, under which the
federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent and the statement continues to
highlight concern about inflation.  Indeed, members may believe that both the upside
and downside risks associated with maintaining the current target rate have
diminished somewhat, given that the turmoil in the subprime market does not appear
to have spread to the rest of the mortgage market or to have led to a more general
retrenchment in financial markets and that readings on core inflation in March were
more favorable.  In the staffs analysis, the real federal funds rate is close to the
Greenbook-consistent measure of its equilibrium value, suggesting that the current
stance of policy, if maintained, is likely to return output to a more sustainable level
over time.  While members may harbor concerns about the glacial pace of the
projected moderation in core inflation, they may nevertheless prefer a patient
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 36
approach rather than incur the risks associated with fostering a more rapid disinflation
in an environment of soft economic growth.  In such circumstances, the Committee
might wish to be particularly clear that its patience does not represent a down-
weighting of its long-run inflation objective.
","Alternative B"
1970-01-15,14,"(14) Policy alternative B. If the Committee should decide
to move toward achieving slightly less firm money market conditions,
it might wish to consider the following second paragraph for the
To implement this policy, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING, System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with

","alternative B"
1970-09-15,14,"(14) Should the Committee desire to seek a 6 per cent growth
rate for the money supply over the fourth quarter and a significant easing
in credit market conditions, it may wish to consider the following
language for the second paragraph of the directive (alternative B):
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat
greater growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in
the first half of the year, while taking account of possible
liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect

credit flows from market to banking channels. System open
market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

money market conditions consistent with that objective, taking
[DEL: account of the effects of other monetary policy actions.]
","alternative B"
1970-11-17,14,"(15) It is most difficult to specify the net reserve position
of banks likely to be consistent with a Federal funds rate in the 5 -
range. Member bank borrowings would likely average in a $300-$400
million range (with the lower end of the range respesenting largely
necessitous long-term borrowing from the window by two banks). But it
is very unclear as to how banks' demands for excess reserves are likely
to change as the Fed funds rate drops further. One would expect that
banks would want to hold somewhat more excess reserves as the Fed funds
rate declined, but at a rate still as high as 5 per cent the level of
excess reserves desired over time may be only $50 - $100 million above
recent experience. This would mean that over a period of several weeks
sizable net free reserves are not likely to be prevalent. But, with
required reserves in a given week fixed by the lagged reserve scheme,
the banking system as a whole (with borrowings at minimal levels) would
have no way in any particular statement week to dispose of excess reserves
created when open market operations supply nonborrowed reserves in
excess of current required reserves in order to encourage bank credit
and deposit expansion. Individual banks could, of course, reduce their
own excess reserves, and the rapidity and eagerness with which they did
so would affect the Federal funds rate. In practice, though, banks may
be slow to realize that the System is easing the money market and thus,
at least for a while, may be sluggish in selling off excess reserves in
the Federal funds market. This could mean that at the beginning of an
effort significantly to ease the money market it would take fairly
sizable excess reserves in the banking system to lower the Federal funds
rate to, say, a 5 per cent average for a statement week. But once
indivdual banks realized that it did not pay to be slow in disposing of
excess reserves, a lower average level of excess reserves for the banking
system would result for any given Fed funds rate.
Policy alternative B. (16) This alternative is presented in
the event that the Committee may wish to consider a more aggressive
easing in the money market than under alternative A in order to increase
the likelihood of moving closer to a 5 per cent money growth rate (and
around 6 per cent bank credit) in the fourth quarter, partly as a way
station to moving on to a 6 - 7 per cent growth path for money for the
fourth and first quarters taken together. Suggested language for such a
directive is shown below.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate

","alternative B, alternative A"
1971-04-06,14,"(14) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction in
terms of desired growth rates for the aggregates, and (b) to adopt as
targets the growth rates (including a 7 per cent second-quarter rise in
M1) discussed earlier in connection with alternative B, which would be
somewhat more moderate than the rates experienced recently,
""To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO

Accommodation of declines in long rates is not listed as a specific
Committee objective under this (and the following) alternative because
of the likelihood that such rates would rise if the money market is
firmed to the degree that would appear to be necessary to achieve the
aggregate growth rates specified. However, a reference is suggested to
purchases of coupon issues ""in the interest of promoting accommodative
conditions in long-term credit markets"" on the assumption that even if
the Committee adopts this alternative it will want to index a concern
with conditions in capital markets.
","Alternative B, alternative B, alternative b"
1971-05-11,14,"(14) Diverse movements developing in the aggregates, unresolved
(as of this writing) exchange market uncertainties, and the recent weak-
ness in bond markets present the Committee with many potentially conflict-
ing objectives. To clarify policy possibilities in view of these conflicts,
three distinct policy alternatives--with sharply differing specifications
--are presented on the following pages: Alternative A aims at stabiliz-
ing credit market conditions; Alternative C aims at pursuit of the
Committee's previously expressed desires with respect to M1 growth; and
Alternative B aims at a ""standard-sized"" FOMC tightening of operational
targets in the interest of moderating the growth of the aggregates some-
what. Aggregate specifications monthly for these alternatives through
the third quarter are shown in the table on the following page. 1/ Alterna-

1971-06-08,14,"(14) Loan demands on banks over the summer months are expected to
be fairly strong as economic recovery proceeds and as some borrowers switch
from the open market to banks. And growth in the adjusted credit proxy may
be somewhat greater in June and the third quarter than in April-May, although
it is in general expected to continue on the moderate side. Instead of
declining, nondeposit sources of funds are projected to show little net change
from their recently prevailing minimal levels; thus, they would no longer be a
negative factor affecting bank credit. Outstanding large CD's are expected
to show little net change from current levels under alternative A, given the
relatively comfortable liquidity position of banks. But with tighter money
market conditions--as under alternatives B and C--a moderate net growth in CD's
might develop as banks attempt to compensate in part for slower growth in other
time and demand deposits. In addition, under tighter reserve conditions, banks
would become less willing purchasers of securities.
Possible directive language
","alternative A"
1971-06-29,14,"(14) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides to continue to formulate its primary
instruction in terms of objectives for the monetary aggregates, sub-
ject to any constraints that might be imposed by developments in
capital markets.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months
ahead, taking account of developments in capital markets.
System open market operations until the next meeting of
the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achiev-
ing bank reserve and money market conditions consistent
with those objectives.""
Although this language is identical to that adopted at the June 8 meeting,
it is not regarded as a ""no change"" directive in the sense of calling for
no further policy action. Rather it calls for holding to the course of
continued orderly firming of bank reserve and money market conditions,
insofar as that might be necessary to maintain downward pressure on the
growth rates of the monetary aggregates. The money market specifications
mentioned earlier in connection with this alternative--including the pro-
posed 5 to 5-1/2 per cent range for the Federal funds rate--would give
the Manager more flexibility to firm market conditions than he would
have under alternative A. If the Committee adopts alternative B it
could choose to instruct the Manager to move gradually toward the
upper end of the indicated range for the funds rate even if the mone-
tary aggregates are growing at the rates specified earlier in connec-
tion with alternative B, so long as it appears that such action would not
be unduly disturbing to the capital markets.
","Alternative B, alternative A, alternative B, alternative B"
1971-08-24,14,"(14) Under alternative A, rates of growth in the other monetary
aggregates are projected to slow significantly after August. The degree of
expected slackening is considerably smaller than for M1, however, reflecting
both the probability of somewhat stronger bank credit demands and increased
success in competing for consumer-type deposits in an environment of lower
market interest rates. Also Government deposits are assumed to remain at
higher than normal levels, as the Treasury hedges against the possibility
of a sudden cash-in of special Treasury certificates by foreign central banks.
Under alternative A banks would probably have to press more actively to obtain
CD funds than under alternative B in order to offset the slower growth in demand
accounts. Under alternative B, growth rates for both M2 and the credit proxy
show little change from the third to fourth quarters on the assumption that
the lower interest rates realized under ^that^ alternative would be associated
with a greater improvement in time deposit performance.
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative B, alternative B"
1971-09-21,14,"(14) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible use
if the Committee decides to seek, or permit, the growth rates for the
aggregates over the months ahead discussed earlier in connection with
alternative A, including rates for M 1 of 1-1/2 and 3-1/2 per cent in
September and the fourth quarter, respectively. The money market and
reserve conditions believed likely to be consistent with such growth rates
are noted in paragraph (8).
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
achieve [DEL: more] moderate growth in monetary and credit
aggregates over the months ahead. System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall
be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and
money market conditions consistent with that objective.""
This language differs from that of the directive adopted at the August 24
meeting only in the deletion of the word ""more"" from the phrase ""to
achieve more moderate growth . . ."" It is assumed that the Committee would
not want to continue to call for 'more moderate growth"" in light of the
August experience, when M 1 and M 2 grew at rates of about 3 and 5 per cent,
","Alternative A, alternative A"
1971-10-19,14,"(14) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides to call for maintenance of prevailing money
market conditions, subject to a proviso clause.

THAT SOMEWHAT EASIER CONDITIONS SHALL BE SOUGHT, TAKING ACOUNT

MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES ARE FALLING SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the
money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (5) as
a description of ""prevailing conditions"", and for purposes of the pro-
viso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in
connection with alternative A as the ""expected"" paths. The proviso
clause has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against signif-
icant shortfalls but not excesses, on the assumption that the Committee
would not want money market conditions to be tightened in the coming
period if M1 and M2 should appear to be expanding on paths above those
projected, which represent comparatively low growth rates for the
fourth quarter.
","Alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1971-11-16,14,"(14) Although the outstanding amount of large CD's and non-
deposit sources has shown little net change in recent weeks, these sources
of funds, particularly large CD's, are expected to resume expansion in
the period ahead. The expansion is likely to be moderate, however, under
either alternative. Over the balance of this year, business loan demands
are expected to be modest in view of the continued comparatively large
volume of capital market financing and the relatively small rate of business
inventory accumulation anticipated. Under alternative C there could be a
pick-up in business borrowing from banks as lending terms ease further,
but the increased inflow of demand and consumer-type deposits associated
with that alternative would probably generate enough resources so that
banks would not need to be more aggressive in that CD market.
","alternative C"
1972-02-15,14,"(14) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides that the Desk should focus primarily on money
market conditions as the day-to-day control variable, giving only as much
weight to bank reserves as was customary in most of 1971. This formulation
could also be used, with appropriate interpretation, to call for about the
same relative emphasis on aggregate reserves and money market conditions as
was decided upon at the January FOMC meeting.

","Alternative A"
1972-03-21,14,"(14) On the assumption that the Committee will want to continue
to use the general procedure agreed upon at the February 15 meeting, the
following language for the second paragraph of the directive, which is
similar to that adopted then, is suggested:
""To implement this policy, while taking account of

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support

(II - moderate ) growth in monetary aggregates over the

If the Committee so wishes, each of three alternative adjectives qualifying
""growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead"" can be taken to
correspond with the similarly numbered pattern of aggregate growth rates
described in the preceding section. For expository purposes these patterns
have been expressed as single point values, but as at the February meeting,
the Committee may, of course, wish to specify its objectives in terms of

Alternative A language is proposed for possible use if the

for the monetary aggregates that were adopted at the meeting on March 21.
The pattern of specifications for this alternative is described in para-
graph (5).
","Alternative A, Alternative A"
1972-05-23,14,"(14) Banks are expected to be relatively aggressive in offer-
ing large negotiable CD's, Strong loan expansion--with business loans
expected to continue rising at around the rate of the past few months--
in conjunction with diminishing net inflow of funds from consumer-type
time deposits are likely to encourage bank demand for CD funds. If
short-term rates rise into the alternative C range, we would expect that
banks would have to rely particularly heavily on large CD's as interest
rate ceilings constrain consumer-type time deposit inflows.

""To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: capital market developments and] possible Treasury [DEL: refunding]
FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead AT SOMEWHAT
FASTER RATES THAN IN RECENT MONTHS.""
","Alternative A"
1972-07-18,14,"(14) Bank business loans, following what appears to be a
transitory drop in June, are expected to resume their rise in the months
ahead in view of the continued substantial increase projected for economic
activity, and for inventory accumulation in particular. If loan demands
strengthen as expected, and assuming bank sources of funds become more
costly and show only moderate growth (as is most likely under alternative C),
banks would probably become more reluctant buyers of longer-term issues of
securities. At the same time, demands for credit in bond markets are
expected to remain around recent levels over the next few months. Thus,
it would appear that bond markets will be under some upward interest rate
pressure unless there is a favorable shift in expectations. However, such
upward pressures may not develop over the weeks ahead if bill rates remain
around current levels. And over the longer run, the still wide spread of
long over short rates seems to permit scope for a rise in short rates
without significant effects on long markets.
","alternative C"
1972-08-15,14,"(14) As money market instruments rise in yield, their increasing
relative attractiveness can be expected to dampen fourth quarter flows
into consumer-type time and savings deposits. Even under alternative A
a moderate slowing of inflows to accounts is expected to occur; under
alternative B the higher level of short-term market rates would have a
more noticeable effect. The money market rates associated with
alternative C would reduce inflows still further, and given present
rate ceilings, they could also make all but the highest yielding longer-
term accounts non-competitive with market instruments by the time of
the year-end interest-crediting period. As shown in the table on page 8,
growth in M2 over the fourth quarter is expected to slow progressively
more than M1 under alternatives B and C.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1972-11-20,14,"(14) Under alternative C, the funds rate might be expected to rise
in a 5 to 6 per cent range over the next few weeks. Attainment of a 5 per
cent growth rate for M1 by the first quarter would probably imply a little
further upward movement in the funds rate in the early part of 1973. Short-
term interest rates generally would be tending to rise as the funds rate moved
consistently above 5-1/4 per cent; the rally in long-term markets would
certainly end and there could be some sympathetic rise in rates there; and
inflows of consumer-type time deposits would begin to slow more noticeably.
Under these circumstances, there would undoubtedly be renewed market
anticipations of a near-term rise in the discount rate.
Proposed directives

the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. In all three alternatives a reference to
Treasury financing operations is proposed in light of the forthcoming
auction of $2 billion in notes and the announced plans for a 20-30
year bond offering in early January. Deletion of the reference to
bank regulatory changes is suggested on the grounds that banks have
adjusted to the new regulations. For alternatives B and C, a reference

to add a reference to Treasury financing because of the regular May
refinancing to be announced late this month, and to delete the reference
to international developments because only a moderate reflow into dollars
has developed in recent weeks and exchange markets have been relatively
quiet. Also, for the sake of clarity, it is proposed to describe the
conditions sought as those ""consistent with"" rather than those ""that

C, the one alternative that contemplates a significant tightening of
the money market.

","alternative
C, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1973-05-15,14,"(14) Long-term interest rates seem likely to rise somewhat under
the conditions of alternative B partly as restraint on bank credit availa-
bility leads banks to participate relatively little as suppliers of funds
in securities markets. Reduced flows of funds to nonbank savings institu-
tions will also work toward upward pressure on mortgage rates and on debt
markets more generally as Federal agencies offer sizable amounts of
securities to help support the mortgage market. Demands on long-term bond
markets, however, still appear quite moderate, and this may permit a rise
in short rates to develop without significant impacts on long rates. But
expectations are very important in the determination of long rates, and
should monetary actions be interpreted as implying that credit will
tighten substantially further, or remain tight for a more extended period
than expected, long rates could well come under more upward pressure.
","alternative B"
1973-06-18,14,"(14) In view of the recent upsurge in short-term interest rates,
growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected to slow in the
second half of the year to around a 5--6 per cent rate under alternative B.
This does not allow for any increase in existing Regulation Q ceilings; if
ceilings were raised across the board by one-half per cent, as is assumed
in the analysis to be presented in Monday's chart show, growth rates would
average about 2 percentage points higher. A sharper slowing in time deposit
inflows, is contemplated under alternative C and less of a slowing under
alternative A.

1973-08-21,14,"(14) Under alternative B, over the next two months, M2 expansion
in a 7-3/4--9-3/4 per cent annual rate range is indicated. The faster in-
crease in M2 relative to M1 results mainly from the initial sizable movement
into consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks in the wake of the
regulatory changes. The initial inflow probably reflected not only some
movement out of demand deposits but, more importantly, shifts of funds from
nonbank thrift institutions. We have assumed a gradual phasing out of
transfers from thrift institutions to banks, though we do not expect it to
subside as promptly as transfers out of demand deposits because of the
maturity distribution of thrift institution deposits and a certain inertia
in shifting deposits from one institution to another. On balance, a con-
siderably more moderate rise in consumer type time deposits is expected in
September than in August, and a further tapering appears in prospect for the
fourth quarter.

1973-09-18,14,"(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

respond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

the word ""immediately"" from the phrase ""over the months immediately
ahead"" to avoid any implication that the Committee seeks to achieve
the aggregate growth rates described within a very few months. As
will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth rates in the
aggregates ""thus far this year."" For the period through August, these

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1973-10-16,14,"(14) Other key assumptions underlying the monetary relation-
ships discussed in this bluebook are: (1) resumed expansion of out-
standing large negotiable CD's, as banks experience moderate business
loan growth and seek to offset a run-off on balance in U.S. Government
deposits between now and year-end; (2) expansion of other time and
savings deposits at banks at a moderate rate under alternative C as
money market conditions remain unchanged and short-term interest rates
rise from current levels, with net inflows strengthening under the
easier conditions of alternatives B and A; (3) reimposition of some
sort of interest rate ceilings on consumer-type certificates maturing
in 4 years or more at banks and other savings institutions, with the
ceiling structure working to redistribute savings flows at the margin
toward nonbank savings institutions.
Proposed directive language
","alternative C"
1973-11-19,14,"(14) Under alternative C, disintermediation would clearly
once again become a pressing problem, particularly around the year-end
reinvestment period. Under alternative B, however, net inflows of consumer-
type time deposits to banks and to thrift institutions may be at a moderate
pace over the next few months. Growth of such deposits at banks is likely
to slow from the relatively rapid pace of recent months, when banks
were able to offer a varied and attractive menu of ceiling-free certificates.
Banks and thrift institutions could, however, have an unfavorable experience
around the year-end reinvestment period even under alternative B if credit
demands are strong enough to generate rising short-term market interest
rates around that time.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1974-01-21,14,"(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed to
add a reference to Treasury financing because of the regular February
refinancing to be announced later this month. As will be noted, the
three alternatives refer to growth rates in the aggregates ""over the
past 12 months."" For the 12 months through December 1973, these are as
follows in terms of the revised series: M1, 5.9 per cent; M2, 8.6 per
cent; and the bank credit proxy, 10.7 per cent.

[DEL: do not appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1974-02-20,14,"(16) Growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits at
banks is likely to continue generally strong, perhaps bolstered by a build-
up in precautionary balances by consumers. The growth, however, will
probably slacken a little from that of January, when net inflows (as in
October) may have been enlarged somewhat by an increased amount of
interest crediting (taking place on the final day of quarters) resulting
from the higher ceiling rates. Under alternative A, growth in consumer-
type time deposits would probably be even more rapid for a while--at least
until further declines in market rates lead banks to begin reducing
offering rates for consumer-type deposits. The expected rise of interest
rates under alternative C would reduce the relative attractiveness of
consumer-type time deposits, though, judging from recent experience, the
effect of higher market rates might be more marked on the specialized
thrift institutions than on commercial banks.
","alternative A, alternative C"
1974-03-18,14,"(14) Under alternative A--which encompasses a 6½ per cent growth
rate for M1 over the next six months--the staff would expect that the
Federal funds rate would not rise from current levels and might, over time,
drop back somewhat. If the funds rate remains around 9¼--9½ per cent,
there may be some further upward rate adjustments in markets, particularly
as the forthcoming Treasury financing is absorbed. A somewhat lower funds
rate would moderate and, perhaps to some degree reverse, recent upward
rate pressures. Short-term rates, particularly bill rates, are likely to
be influenced by the strength of business loan demands and by the way in
which the recycling of oil money affects U.S. markets. Assuming business
loan growth is moderate, banks, under this alternative, would probably
not be a source of pressure on markets in view of the continued availability
of demand deposits and strong growth in time and savings deposits other than
large CD's. Under the circumstances, banks would have little interest
in issuing additional CD's or in borrowing from the Euro-dollar market,
unless rates in that market were to drop sharply with the receipt of Arab
oil money in volume.
","alternative A"
1974-04-15,14,"(14) A rise in the funds rate over the next few weeks--such
as would be likely under alternative C-- would generate market expecta-
tions of a further tightening of monetary policy. This would offset any
tendency for short-term rates to decline, even temporarily, and would
probably result in further upward adjustments. Over the next few months,
the 3-month bill rate could be around 9 per cent, and possibly higher in
the summer when Treasury cash borrowing demands are seasonally strong.
","alternative C"
1974-05-21,14,"(14) The funds rate has been subject to upward pressure, in
part because of a shift of bank borrowing preferences from the window to
the funds market. This pressure may moderate, however, if more normal
borrowing preferences come to prevail. We have assumed that member banks
will want to increase their borrowing (apart from special borrowing) to
about $2 billion per week on average under alternative A, given the roughly 3
percentage point spread of the Federal funds rate over the current 8 per
cent discount rate. Special borrowing by a problem bank may add another
$1 billion or so to borrowing levels.
","alternative A"
1974-06-18,14,"(14) The substantial injection of nonborrowed reserves that
seems necessary to attain the aggregates of alternative A would probably
lead to an easing of money market conditions. A downward movement in the
funds rate--and especially a drop to the 10¾ per cent mid-point of the
range shown for this alternative--would be accompanied by a sharp decline
in market interest rates as investors came to believe that monetary policy
had made a major turn. The decline would be especially large in short-
term markets. In the Treasury bill market, the 3-month bill rate could
drop to below 7 per cent in view of the limited market supply at the
moment and the sizable volume of maturing mid-June tax bills. Given
the basic strength of credit demands, however, the immediate decline in
interest rates would probably be followed by a gradual upward readjustment
if the Federal funds rate were to hold around 10¾ per cent.
Proposed directive language
","alternative A"
1974-07-16,14,"(14) Under alternative A--which contemplates M1 growth at
a 7 per cent annual rate over the second half of the year--the Federal
funds rate would be expected to decline to around 11 per cent between
now and the next Committee meeting, probably stimulating a fairly marked
decline of interest rates over a broad maturity spectrum. Interest
rate declines would be intensified in the short run as market attitudes
with respect to monetary policy shift and as Government security dealers
begin to cover short positions. However, given the size of prospective
borrowing demands and the concern over inflation, rate declines would
not be likely to cumulate. For example, recently postponed municipal and
corporate offerings would probably be re-offered shortly under the circum-
stances, and this would tend to moderate downward rate pressures. The
position of banks and thrift institutions would ease under this alternative,
though remaining on the tight side as compared with historical experience,
since an 11 per cent Federal funds rate implies a structure of market
rates still quite attractive relative to present Regulation Q ceilings.
","alternative A"
1974-09-10,14,"(14) Alternative A presents a more expansive policy alternative,
characterized by a 6 per cent long-run rate of growth in M1 and a
greater near-term decline in the Federal funds rate. Expectational effects
on markets would be quite strong, and market interest rates generally
could be expected to decline rather sharply. Improvement in the position
of thrift institutions would be rather marked, and mortgage rates, after
some time, may begin to decline. Banks could expand CD offerings over
the near-term to obtain funds for investment in longer-term market
securities while high yields on the securities are still available.
","Alternative A"
1974-10-14,14,"(14) Alternative A contemplates a more rapid growth path for
M1 than under alternative B. To achieve this growth a more pronounced
easing of money market conditions is therefore required, and we believe
that the funds rate would need to drop to 9 per cent shortly after the
Committee meeting. Such a decline would generate substantial expectational
effects, with Treasury bill rates probably dropping by more than a per-
centage point, and longer-term market rates easing off. Inflows of
consumer-type time And savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions
would improve noticeably; the thrift institutions would be in a position
to improve liquidity; and lenders would probably become more willing to
make new mortgage commitments.
Proposed directive language
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1974-12-16,14,"(14) A drop in the funds rate to aroung 8-3/8 per cent would
probably forestall tendencies for interest rates to back up, and would
likely lead to a modest renewal of rate declines. A drop in the funds
rate to around 8 per cent would have an appreciable downward effect on
short-term market rates, would trigger further declines in bank prime
loan rates, and would more noticeably ease long-term market conditions.
Market expectations of a further decline in the discount rate might
begin to develop, but they would become much more pronounced if the
funds rate were to drop as much as is implied under alternative A.
(14) Net inflows of time and savings deposits (other than
money market CD's) at banks are likely to continue to be relatively strong
under each of the alternatives presented, with growth highest, of course,
under the easiest alternative. The position of thrift institutions
probably also will continue to improve, even under alternative D.
However, it would probably require a further decline in market interest
rates, and an accompanying more rapid inflow of savings funds,to ensure
a significant liberalization in mortgage loan commitment policies by
thrift institutions.
","alternative A"
1975-01-20,14,"(14) Similar assumptions to those for consumer-type time
deposits at banks were made for deposit flows at thrift institutions.
Given the apparently weak mortgage demand, downward pressures on mortgage
interest rates might be expected in the months ahead under all three
alternatives, with declines in mortgage rates the largest, of course,
under alternative A. Under the easing alternatives, conditions leading
to a reversal of such rate declines would tend to develop as time passes,
though perhaps not until after mid-year.
","alternative A"
1975-02-19,14,"(14) Private short-term credit demands are expected to remain
weak into early spring, but the Treasury is likely to borrow an additional
$15-$18 billion of new cash between now and mid-April. The provision of
bank reserves and easing of money market conditions needed to sustain
growth in the monetary aggregates, as specified in alternative B, should,
at least over the near-term, permit the new Treasury debt to be absorbed
at declining interest rates, though the reductions may be modest. The
shift in borrowing demands from private sectors to the Treasury,
private short-term rates may decline more. Longer-term rates may
show rather modest further declines, however, since corporate and state
and local government demands on bond markets are expected to remain
","alternative B"
1975-04-14,14,"(14) A rise in the Federal funds rate to around the 6 per
cent level--as shown for alternative B short-run specifications in
paragraph (10)--would probably lead to a sharp market reaction. The
coupon issues, particularly short-term coupons, might rise another 50
basis points, or possibly more in the short-run as markets over-anticipate
the extent of monetary tightening in process. Such a rise would lead to
yields in the 7¾-8 per cent area on 2-year Treasury notes--a yield level
which, if sustained, would begin to attract funds that might otherwise
go into banks and thrift instituions. We have assumed some moderation
in such flows under this alternative, but they are expected to remain
relatively large over the next few months. The availability of mortgage
market funds may not, therefore, be significantly limited in this period.
","alternative B"
1975-05-20,14,"(14) Alternative A involves a further easing of money market
conditions, which would likely be accompanied by further downward adjust-
ments in market interest rates more generally. Declines in bond rates
might be rather limited, however, as corporate borrowers would be expected
to accelerate offerings in order to take advantage of a more favorable
market environment. Over the second and third quarters, M1 growth would
be projected at around 8 per cent at an annual rate, while growth in M2
might be at an 11 per cent rate. A substantially lower rate of
monetary growth would be required in the fourth and first quarters unless
the Committee were to raise its longer-run targets, and, as noted
earlier, this would probably require a marked upward readjustment in
interest rates later this year.
","Alternative A"
1975-08-19,14,"(14) Under any of the alternatives time deposit inflows
would be expected to moderate from those of the recent past. Some
slowing is already evident in the recent data, mainly because the
special Treasury payments to individuals have terminated. Increasingly,
however, higher market interest rates will come to impinge on savings
inflows to the intermediaries, and under alternative C this impact
would probably be quite pronounced by the fourth quarter. Because
of the developing squeeze, we have assumed an increase in Regulation Q
ceilings amounting to one-half a percentage point for longer-term certifi-
cates (to become effective by year-end) under all alternatives presented.
This assumption reduces, but does not eliminate, the marked slowing
that would otherwise have been projected in the rate of expansion
of consumer-type time deposits and the more broadly defined measures
of money supply.
","alternative C"
1975-09-16,14,"(14) Alternative C encompasses an immediate substantial tightening
of the money market and is characterized by a Federal funds rate range
for the intermeeting period of 6 -8 per cent, centering on 7¼ per cent.
With growth in nonborrowed reserves more constrained, member bank borrowing
under this alternative would be likely to rise to $400 million or more,
given the 6 per cent discount rate. Nonetheless, growth of M1 in
September-October would probably be reduced somewhat, to the 6-8 per cent
area. Interest rates generally would rise quite sharply during the next
month under this alternative, particularly given the very large Treasury
financing demands described in paragraph (6). A rise in the 3-month bill
rate to [8] per cent or a little above would not be unlikely, and the yield
on 2-year Treasury notes could exceed 9 per cent.
","Alternative C"
1975-10-21,14,"(14) A slight easing of the money market, as is contemplated by
the mid-point of the 5-6 per cent Federal funds rate range shown for
alternative A, might be accompanied by some further declines in market
interest rates. These declines probably would not be particularly large
since many market participants may still expect rates to turn around later.
Such an expectation would be reinforced to the extent that incoming business
news continues to be good. A larger decline in the funds rate to around
the 5 per cent bottom of the alternative A range would of course trigger
more substantial interest rate declines as the market's assessment of future
monetary policy and possibly also the business outlook changes.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1975-11-18,14,"(14) Alternative C involves some rise in the Federal funds rate
over the next few weeks, to the mid-point of a 5 -6 per cent range. Such
a reversal in the recent trend of the funds rate would likely be accompanied
by a sharp rebound in market rates; the 3-month bill rate, for example, might
promptly move up to the 6-6½ per cent area. But if interest rates are pushed
up over the next few weeks, it is likely that less of an increase would
be required over the longer run than under alternatives A or B, since an
early start will have been made in restraining money demand. It seems
probable that the alternative C strategy might lead to a funds rate that
peaks out at around 6¾ per cent next year. Thus, over the longer run this
approach would place less pressure on banks and thrift institutions. In the
short run, however, recent easing tendencies in bank and mortgage loans rates
would be quickly reversed.
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1975-12-16,14,"(14) Should the Committee desire to formulate the directive
in terms of bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed
would depend on the specific conditions sought. These alternative ""money
market"" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy
alternatives are given below.
Alternative ""Money Market"" Proposals
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: more than usual] account
of developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money
market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED THAT

money market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED
THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES

To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: more than usual] account
of developments in domestic and international financial markets,

money market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED
THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES DO NOT APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT RATES BELOW
THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead].
(14) In all four of the alternatives, it is proposed to delete the
words ""more than usual"" in the phrase, ""while taking more than usual account
of developments in domestic and international financial markets,"" since
action by the Federal Government has somewhat eased New York City's near-
term financial problems.

expected to persist until late spring or early summer. The funds rate
would then be expected to begin rising, given continued expansion in GNP.
The funds rate would be likely to be around 6 per cent by late 1976, assuming
money growth over the year is held to around 7¼ per cent under this
","alternative A"
1976-02-17,14,"(14) Alternative C involves a rise in the Federal funds rate to
the mid-point of a 4¾ to 5¾ per cent range over the next few weeks. This
may engender increases of as much as 50 to 100 basis points in other
short-term rates and in yields on Treasury notes, given current market
expectations of near-term rate stability and the heavy prospective volume
of Treasury financing. Rate increases on longer-term market securities
would probably be less pronounced. The prospect for reduced flows to
thrift institutions would forestall any further decline in mortgage rates
and may set the stage for some back-up.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1976-04-20,14,"(14) Over the period immediately ahead, internal funds available
to the business sector are expected to remain quite ample relative to
requirements generated by inventory and capital investment, so that little
pick-up in business short-term credit demands is anticipated. As expenditures
continue to rise, though, businesses later this year are expected to turn
increasingly to commercial banks and the paper market for funds. Under
alternatives A and B, banks are likely to have sufficient funds available
without reliance on significant increases in CD's. But under alternative
C limited fund flows by late this year could induce banks to rely
appreciably more on sales of CD's to satisfy credit demands.
Proposed directive
","alternative
C"
1976-06-22,14,"(14) Alternative A assumes an easing in the Federal funds rate
to the mid-point of a 4½-5½ per cent range between now and the next
Committee meeting. Such an easing would encourage more rapid money growth
in the third and fourth quarter than under alternatives B and C. However,
if the FOMC also wished to constrain longer-run M1 growth to 5¼ per cent,
alternative A would entail a more pronounced slowing in the rate of expansion
of M1 in early 1977 and a sharper rise in interest rates in late 1976 and
early 1977 than would the other two alternatives.
Proposed directive
","Alternative A, alternative A"
1976-07-19,14,"(14) Alternative C contemplates a modest tightening of the money
market over the next few weeks, with the Federal funds rate moving to the
rates undoubtedly would have to rise appreciably further if M1 growth over
the QII '76 to QII '77 period is to be constrained to the 4-3/4 per cent
mid-point of the longer-run range. By the spring of 1977, the funds rate
might be around 8-1/4 per cent. Under these circumstances, inflows of
funds into small-denomination deposits at banks and thrift institutions in
the first half of 1977 would be depressed by the greater relative attrac-
tiveness of rates on market instruments, even though under this alternative
Regulation Q ceilings are assumed to be relaxed in the fourth quarter of 1976.
","Alternative C"
1976-08-17,14,"(14) While alternative C involves more near-term restraint than
B, the early move toward tightening would work to limit interest rate
increases needed over the longer run to maintain M1 growth over the QII
'76-QII '77 period at around 5-3/4 per cent. The staff believes that the
funds rate could peak out at around 6-3/4 per cent during the fall under
an alternative C approach. At such a rate level, it appears that an
upward adjustment in Regulation Q may not be needed to enable the Com-
mittee to attain its longer-run M2 and M3 objectives.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1976-09-21,14,"(14) A little slower growth in the monetary aggregates would,
of course, be likely to develop over the September-October period under
alternative C than under either of the other two alternatives. In
particular, growth in savings deposits may well come to a halt, at least
temporarily, as depositors shift to higher-yielding market instruments.
Banks may seek to compensate for this to some extent by more aggressive
offerings of time deposits, including large CD's. On balance, under this
alternative we would expect M1 over the forthcoming two-month period to
expand in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and M2 in an 8-12 per cent
","alternative C"
1976-10-19,14,"(14) Alternative C involves a rise in the funds rate over the
next few weeks to the 5-1/2 per cent mid-point of a 5-6 per cent range.
Under those conditions, market interest rates would, of course, rise
between now and the next Committee meeting. The increase might be fairly
sharp since a sizable Treasury financing will be in process and since cur-
rent dealer positions in Treasury securities remain substantial, although
not quite as large as a month ago. Net inflows of funds to banks and
thrift institutions through interest-bearing deposits, particularly savings
deposits, would be constrained somewhat by such a move in the funds rate--
which would probably be accompanied by a rise in the 3-month bill rate back
to near 5-1/2 per cent. However, the net inflows of interest-bearing
deposits would still remain ample, and banks and thrift institutions would
not be likely to tighten non-price lending terms, even though the prime
loan rate, and perhaps mortgage rates, might edge upwards.
","Alternative C"
1976-11-16,14,"(14) Expansion in M2 is expected to be quite sizable in November
and December. Recent data suggest that net inflows of time and savings
deposits (other than large CD's) at banks are continuing at around the
rapid September-October pace. Interest rates on such deposits are expected
to remain attractive over the weeks ahead as competing market interest
rates remain relatively low, especially under alternatives A and B. With
the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, growth for M2
during November-December may be in a 9½-13½ per cent annual rate range--
the mid-point of which is above the upper limit of the Committee's longer-
run range. (The mid-point of the 2-month M1 growth band, on the other hand,
is at the lower limit of its longer-run range). The tightening of money
market conditions contemplated under alternative C may reduce the 2-month
M2 growth rate to an 8½-12½ per cent range.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1977-01-17,14,"(14) Over the longer-run, under alternative A, we would not
expect a very substantial rise in interest rates to develop, however,
since the higher longer-run growth in the monetary aggregates embodied
in that alternative would be more accommodative of money and credit
demands. The funds rate would probably have to rise under this alterna-
tive, given the projected strength of the economy, but perhaps to no
more than an average level of around 5¼ per cent by the fourth quarter
of the year.
","alternative A"
1977-02-15,14,"(14) The tightening of the money market and slower near-term
growth in nonborrowed reserves under alternative C would also tend to
hold down expansion of the monetary aggregates over the February-March
period as compared with alternative B. It would also be likely to lead
to slower growth in the aggregates over the first half of 1977, assuming
that the funds rate were permitted to rise somewhat further in the spring.
However, alternative C would require a more rapid growth in the aggregates
than alternative B in the second half of 1977 to attain the longer-run,
QIV '76-QIV '77 ranges for the aggregates adopted by the FOMC. Thus,
monetary policy would have to be more accommodative in the latter part
of 1977, and the Federal funds rate would not be likely to rise as
high as under alternative B. We estimate that the rate would, as a result,
peak at about 6 per cent in the summer of this year.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1977-05-17,14,"(14) An immediate tightening of the money market, such as
is called for under alternative C, would probably reduce somewhat the
level to which the funds rate would have to rise ultimately to restrain
monetary growth to within the FOMC's longer-run ranges. We would
expect the funds rate to peak at around 6¾ per cent in the winter of
this year.
","alternative C"
1977-06-21,14,"(14) The immediate tightening of the money market under
alternative C would tend to lessen the degree of restraint that would be
needed later to achieve growth in M-1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period near
the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range. The funds rate under
this alternative would be expected to reach 6½ per cent in the fourth
quarter of this year and to remain around that level in early 1978.
Because short-term market interest rates also would be expected to be
lower than under alternative B or A, banks and thrift institutions
should be able to maintain stronger inflows of interest-bearing
deposits at that time. Although growth in M-2 and M-3 would consequently
be stronger in late 1977 and early 1978 than under the other alternatives,
even under alternative C the growth rates projected for M-2 and M-3
over the year ending QI '78 are in the lower part of their respective
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1977-07-19,14,"(14) As noted earlier, both alternatives C and D contemplate
lower longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative
B. While the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative D,
in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate
between now and the next meeting to around 5-7/8 per cent, the midpoint of
a 5½-6¼ per cent range. Such a funds rate increase is likely to be
accompanied by an increase in short-term rates of interest generally of
about ½ percentage point. Member bank borrowings from the discount window
may rise $50-100 million further, and markets may come to anticipate a rise
in the discount rate from its current 5¼ per cent level.
","alternative
B"
1977-11-15,14,"(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds
rate to the mid-point of a 6¾ to 7¼ per cent range between now and the
next Committee meeting. With additional monetary restraint in place some-
what sooner, the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to
be somewhat slower over the next few months than under Alternative B. Con-
sequently, somewhat less monetary restraint would be needed later in 1978,
and interest rates would rise a little less next year under alternative C
than under B.
","Alternative C, Alternative B, alternative C"
1977-12-19,14,"(14) If the Federal funds rate remains near its present
alternative B, short-term rates probably will remain fairly
near their current levels. Credit demands are not likely to exert
upward pressures on short-term rates in the weeks immediately ahead.
The Treasury is not expected to expand the supply of bills until late
January or early February. In private short-term markets, banks are
likely to issue a sizable amount of new large, negotiable CD's in
coming weeks, though the amount issued will probably drop below
the exceptional volume of the fourth quarter, as other deposit
inflows pick-up somewhat and loan demands moderate.
","alternative B"
1978-01-17,14,"(14) Beyond the intermeeting period, short-term interest
rates are expected to be under renewed upward pressure as efforts are
made to limit M-1 expansion to the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the
alternative B longer-run range. As short-term rates rise, some further
induced increase in intermediate-term rates can be expected. Thus,
even with the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings, inflows to
thrifts will probably not be sufficient to enable them to meet their
mortgage commitments without further increases in borrowings from
the FHLBanks. Under the circumstances, mortgage rates are
likely to come under upward pressure. Banks would find it necessary
to continue to offer large denomination time deposits in volume to
supplement their deposit sources, and to reduce further their port-
folio liquidity in order to meet loan demands. Moreover, with
Treasury, corporate, and municipal bond offerings remaining sizable,
long-term yields can also be expected to be under renewed upward pres-
sure. Such increases, however, will be limited by the continued high
cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds.
","alternative B"
1978-03-21,14,"(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range between now
and mid-April. Growth in M-1 in the March-April period would probably
be in a 4 to 9 per cent and M-2 in a 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent annual
rate range. Although the market is expecting some tightening of policy
later this spring, an increase in the Federal funds rate over the
near-term apparently is not being anticipated by market participants,
given the recent moderation of growth in the monetary aggregates.
The 3-month bill might move into a 6-5/8--6-3/4 per cent area, and
there would be commensurate adjustment in other short-term rates.
Member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially,
producing expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate.
Such borrowing has been relatively low recently, and no banks are under
administrative pressure at the window.
","Alternative C"
1978-04-18,14,"(14) Under alternative B, inflows to savings and loan associa-
tions and mutual savings banks over the April-May period can be expected
to remain at near the 6 to 7 per cent average monthly rate prevailing
since year end. Consequently, thrifts are likely to continue to reduce
their portfolio liquidity and to increase their borrowing from the
Federal Home Loan Banks and others. At the same time, the commitment
and other mortgage lending policies of thrift institutions are likely
to be tightened further.
","alternative B"
1978-05-16,14,"(15) The Federal funds rate level that the staff believes
will be needed to induce such velocity increases are shown in
Appendix I. Under alternative A the Federal funds rate might need
to rise by fall into a range of 9 to 10 per cent--about one percentage
point higher than projected last month.1/ These projections assume
some further downward shift in the demand for money--as a result, for
example, of more intensive marketing of previously introduced innovations
and interest rates in the Board's econometric model has not generated
any evidence of a further downward shift over the past five quarters.
","alternative A"
1978-06-20,14,"(14) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to around the mid-point of a 7½ to 8 per cent range
between now and mid-July. M-1 growth would likely be in a 6½ to
in a 6½ to 10½ per cent range. The additional firming of ¼ percentage
point in the funds rate under this alternative would likely be
associated with upward adjustments in short-term market rates of
the same magnitude, or perhaps a bit more since business short- and
intermediate-term credit demands are expected to remain sizable. In
addition to a probable further increase in the prime rate from the
recently established 8¾ per cent level, banks and other lenders can be
expected to continue to firm up non-rate loan terms and conditions.
Borrowing from the Federal Reserve discount window would become
even more attractive to member banks, and the resultant rise in such
borrowings would increase pressure for another adjustment in the
discount rate.
","Alternative B"
1978-07-18,14,"(14) Alternative B contemplates a Federal funds rate
centered on the prevailing 7¾ per cent level between now and the
next FOMC meeting. Growth of M-1 in the July-August period is
expected to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under this
alternative, largely in consequence of the step-up in M-1 growth
that appears in train for July. With growth at the mid-point of
that range, the level of M-1 will remain well above that implied
by the upper end of the FOMC's current longer-run range, as indicated
in Chart 1 on the following page. And for the third quarter as a
whole M-1 growth may be around a 7-1/4 to 7-1/2 per cent annual rate--
high relative to the longer-run range but slower than in the second
quarter, mainly reflecting the current deceleration in economic
activity and a lagged response to the appreciable increase in short-
term rates this spring.
","Alternative B"
1978-08-15,14,"(14) The staff still expects that interest rates between
now and mid-1979 will have to rise beyond those contemplated
under the short-run specifications for alternative B--given projec-
tions for GNP growth--if M-1 growth over the one-year QII '78 to
QII '79 period is to be around the upper limit1/ of the 4 to 6 per
cent range adopted for that aggregate. Federal funds rate projections
through the second quarter of next year are shown in appendix I.
Directive language
","alternative B"
1978-09-19,14,"(14) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate by mid-October to around the midpoint of an 8-1/4 to 9 per
cent range. M-1 growth would likely be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual
rate range over September-October and M-2 growth in a 7-1/2 to 11-1/2
per cent range. The further increase in short-term rates would be
expected to slow the inflows of interest-bearing deposits subject to
regulatory ceilings at banks and thrifts, but recent evidence suggests
that the new 6-month certificates will probably blunt some of the
impact of rising rates on deposit growth, especially at thrifts.
","Alternative B"
1978-11-21,14,"(14) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would
rise by mid-December to the midpoint of a 9¾ to 10½ per cent range.
M-1 growth would likely be in a ½ to 5½ per cent annual rate range
over November-December, and M-1+ and M-2, respectively in 1½ to 5½
and 6 to 10 per cent ranges. The further increases in short-term
rates would slow M-2 and M-3 growth only modestly, as more aggressive
offerings of 6-month certificates and large-denomination time
deposits could be expected partly to offset weakness in other deposits.
","alternative B"
1979-02-06,14,"(14) below.
(11) Expansion of nominal GNP over the longer-run policy
period, while projected to moderate, is still expected to be around
its cash balances back into line with growing transactions needs.
However, the staff expects that the demand for M-1 will not be so
strong over the year, on average, as to require a significant change
in the prevailing Federal funds rate if M-1 growth at the midpoint of
the alternative B range is to be achieved over the year 1979. With
nominal GNP projected to expand more rapidly in the first half of
next few months and then recede later in the year. Alternative C, on the
other hand, would probably involve an increase in the funds rate from
current levels to nearly 11 per cent in the course of the year. By contrast,
alternative A would imply a reduction in the funds rate, reaching
year-end levels about ¾ of a percentage point below the current level.
The staff projection of the quarterly pattern of the funds rate for
each alternative is shown in Appendix I.
(12) The specifications imply further rapid increase
in the velocity of M-1, even abstracting from ATS effects, as shown in
Appendix II. The recent weakness in M-1 at a time of strong economic
growth is considerably larger than can be explained by standard
econometric specifications of the relationship between interest rates
and money demand and by the shift of demand balances to ATS and NOW
accounts. The shortfall in money demand apparently reflects a
wider adoption and more intensive use of techniques to economize
on cash, induced in part by the sustained high interest rate levels,
and the staff has assumed that a downward shift in money demand is
likely to continue over 1979. The shift is projected to reduce M-1
growth (and thus increase V-l) by about 2 percentage points over
the longer-run policy period.
(13) Under alternative B, M-2 growth for the year ahead
is expected to be in a 4½ to 7 per cent range and M-3 growth in a
than their current longer-run ranges for the QIII '78 to QIII '79
period. This reduction reflects the slower rate of growth in the
time and savings deposit component of these two aggregates that
is now expected on average over the course of the year, given recent
experience. The public has been diverting larger amounts of funds
than expected from deposits subject to fixed ceiling rates to market
instruments. Our projections assume a pick-up in growth of such
deposits, but not to the pace earlier expected. Growth of the
broader monetary aggregates is, of course, slower under alternative C
and more rapid under alternative A.
(14) The range for bank credit growth for alternative B
has been reduced to 7½ to 10 per cent--1 percentage point lower than
its current range, reflecting the slowing of economic activity, the
sustained higher level of interest rates, and the cumulative
reduction in bank liquidity. To sustain such credit growth in the
face of slower inflows of demand and consumer-type time and savings
deposits, banks would have to rely increasingly on large negotiable
time deposits, nondeposit borrowings, including Eurodollars, and to
reduce further their holdings of liquid assets. Thrifts are also
likely to have to rely on FHLB and other borrowings, as well as
reductions in their liquidity position, to fund their mortgage lending.

1979-03-20,14,"(14) Under alternative B, M-2 is expected to expand in a 3 to
recent rate of growth. Most of the acceleration reflects the projected
strengthening of M-1, but the interest-bearing component of M-2 is
expected to rise a little faster than it has, on average, over the past
few months. Commercial banks can be expected to benefit to some extent
from the elimination of the rate ceiling differential on MMCs, effective
mid-March, and the unusually rapid outflow of savings deposits of recent
months is expected to diminish. However, as shown in the chart on the
following page, even growth in M-2 at the upper end of the alternative B
range would leave the level of this aggregate in April below the lower end
of the path implied by the Committee's longer-run range.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1979-04-17,14,"(14) Alternative C contemplates a rise in the Federal funds
rate to the midpoint of a 10¼ to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and M-2
would likely be in an annual rate range of 2 to 6 and 4 to 8 per cent,
respectively. Short-term interest rates probably would increase in line
with the rise in the funds rate. It is less clear what might happen
to long-term rates. They may rise some in sympathy with the increase in
short rates. But it is equally likely that they may show little net change,
or perhaps even decline some, if the market comes to believe that interest
rates may peak sooner than otherwise.
","Alternative C"
1979-07-11,14,"(14) The Federal funds rate patterns through 1980 associated
with the proposed longer-run monetary ranges, given the related GNP pro-
jections, are shown in appendix I. For simplicity, these patterns assume
that the growth path for the aggregates adopted for 1979 will continue
into 1980. Thus, they assume that alternative B for 1979 is followed by
B/B'--an unchanged policy with respect to the aggregates--the Federal
funds rate is expected to decline somewhat by early 1980 (to a level
of around 9-1/2 percent), assuming economic activity weakens about as
projected. As growth in nominal GNP accelerates in 1980, this decline
is projected to be reversed in order to constrain growth in the
aggregates to around the midpoints of the B' range. It should be noted
that the upward pressure on interest rates re-emerges even though we
have assumed a rather substantial downward shift in money demand
relative to income in 1980.

","alternative B"
1979-08-14,14,"(14) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate
to the midpoint of a 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent range. Growth in M-1 and M-2
over the August-September period would likely be in annual rate ranges of
term market rates could decline rather considerably, since the market at
present does not expect an easing in the System's posture. Given the
recent data on inflation and unemployment, and the prevailing state of
expectations regarding monetary policy, such a movement in domestic rates
would likely lead to an appreciable weakening of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets. Purchases of Treasuries by foreign official institutions
associated with any substantial intervention activity might result in
relatively larger declines in Treasury bill rates than in private rates.
In long-term debt markets, bond yields would probably also decline, though
such tendencies would be limited if an easing in the funds rate were to
strengthen inflationary expectations. Thrift deposit flows would benefit
from the decline in market rates, especially if bill yields fell enough
to reopen a ceiling rate differential, and mortgage rates might edge
","Alternative A"
1979-09-18,14,"(14) There may still be some expectation in the market that the
Federal funds rate will rise over the near term. Thus, if funds continue
to trade around the prevailing 11-3/8 percent--the midpoint of the alternative B
range--both short- and long-term market rates could decline. However, any
such movement is likely to be limited since aggregate credit demands are
expected to remain strong in the weeks ahead, before edging off later in
the year as economic activity weakens. Business credit demands are likely
to continue to be substantial in the very near term, mainly in short-term
markets. In addition, the amount of cash raised by the Treasury in the
market over the next month is expected to remain near recent levels, with
the sale of $1 to $2 billion of 15-year bonds and $200 million add-ons to
weekly bill auctions. In the near term, new issues of municipal bonds are
likely to continue sizable, given the large volume of mortgage revenue bonds
still in the pipeline. With the Federal funds rate unchanged and no
significant decline expected in other money market rates, adoption of
Alternative B should in itself have no substantial impact on the value of
the dollar in exchange markets.

aggregates over the December to March period, with suggested continuations
through the second quarter. Also shown are proposed intermeeting federal
funds rate ranges and implied growth rates for the aggregates in the two-
month January to March period that are consistent with the basic three-month

can be considered to be equivalent to the 4½ percent M-1 target for that

1980-03-18,14,"(14) As shown in the charts, the aggregate specifications of
alternative C imply that M-1A and M-1B would be below their midpoint paths
by June. Consequently, to achieve the midpoint of the longer-run ranges
for all of 1980, the Committee would have to raise money growth in the
second half of the year. In that period, interest rates are expected to be
under downward pressure in any event in view of the sharp reduction in real
GNP that the staff is projecting. A federal funds rate of around 14 per-
cent would be projected for late 1980 under alternative B, and would be
a bit lower under alternative C.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1980-05-20,14,"(14) With the federal funds rate essentially unchanged in the
near term, as contemplated under alternative A, other market interest rates
probably would hold near current levels or edge upward a bit, especially
if and as monetary growth strengthened perceptibly. A limited back-up in
market rates, however, is unlikely to halt the downtrend of bank loan and
mortgage rates, rates that are still high relative to competitive instruments.
Business credit demands in the period ahead may still fall relatively heavily
on the corporate bond markets, as firms continue efforts to restructure
their balance sheets at what appear to be relatively attractive long-term
yields. But even so loan growth at banks could pick up, particularly if
recent loan weakness makes banks a bit more sanguine about their ability
to remain within loan restraint guidelines.
","alternative A"
1980-08-12,14,"(14) Alternative B calls for a slower expansion in the aggregates--
with growth of M-1A below the minimum targets adopted by the Committee last
month--in order to counter the tendency for M-2 growth to exceed the
Committee's longer-run range. To achieve the alternative B targets, growth
in total reserves at about a 5 percent annual rate would be required. With
adjustment borrowings assumed to be about $200 million, nonborrowed reserves
would expand at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate. At the current discount rate,
these specifications suggest that the federal funds rate would move toward
the 11 percent area in the intermeeting period. Interest rates would be
expected to rise throughout the maturity spectrum. The bank prime rate
almost certainly would be increased, and home mortgate rates, already
under upward pressure from recent increases in other interest rates, pro-
bably also would rise significantly-especially in light of the greater
concerns about deposit flows that would develop among lenders. The recent
strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets probably would
continue, moderated by U.S. official purchases of foreign currencies to
repay swap debt.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1980-09-16,14,"(14) Alternative B calls for about 2 percentage points less
growth in M-1A and M-1B than alternative A over the last four months
of the year. For the one year QIV '79-QIV '80 period, growth in M-1A
would be 4 percent and M-1B 6 percent, in the lower and upper halves
of their respective ranges. M-2 growth would also be slower under
this alternative, but by considerably less than the narrow aggregates,
as the restraining effect of rising market interest rates is blunted by
upward adjustments in yields on interest-bearing deposits and other assets
in M-2. Over the QIV '79-QIV '80 period, M-2 growth would remain above
the Committee's upper limit under this alternative.
","Alternative B, alternative A"
1980-11-18,14,"(14) Alternative A encompasses somewhat higher money targets for
the fourth quarter than alternative B--targets that are thought to be
achievable with little change in interest rates from current levels. Assuming
a level of member bank borrowing of around $1½ billion, nonborrowed and
total reserves under this alternative would be expected to increase at
annual rates of 4 and 7 percent, respectively, over the October to December
period, and the federal funds rate may be around the 14 to 15 percent area.
Other market interest rates also would be expected to remain at about their
current levels. However, some short-term rates might adjust up slightly
further due to the strength in short-term credit demands and, in the case
of the prime and mortgage rates, to lagged adjustments to the tightening
that has already occurred. With interest rates lower over the balance of
the year than under alternative B, money growth and economic activity would
be expected to be less weak in early 1981.
","Alternative A, alternative B, alternative B"
1981-02-02,14,"(14) We have assumed that funds will flow into OCD at a progressively
slower pace in February and March--increasing about $1½ billion and $750 million
per week in those months, respectively. (In the first week of January OCD
increased by about $9 billion, but in the last week of the month such accounts
are estimated to have risen only about $2¼ billion.) On these assumptions
actual growth in M-1A would be reduced by about 13 percentage points over
February and March and M-1B growth would be increased by about 4½ percentage
points. This would mean, for instance, that under alternative A actual M-1A
would decline at a 5½ percent annual rate, and actual M-1B increase at a
relatively large degree of shifting in the early months of 1981 results in
a temporary deviation of actual M-1A and M-1B growth from their expected
ranges for the year.
","alternative A"
1981-03-31,14,"(14) Greater restraint on money growth relative to demand would
be imposed under alternatives B and C, which involve limiting growth in
adjusted M-1B to rates of 6 and 4-1/2 percent, respectively, over the next
three months-substantially lower rates than the 8-3/4 percent of alternative
A. Growth in total reserves over the period would be at annual rates of
rate in the area of 15 to 17 percent, or somewhat higher, might emerge over
the next few weeks under alternative B1/. Still greater rate pressures
would develop under alternative C. Borrowing at the discount window might
be around $1-1/2 billion under B and, of course, higher under C. The upward
response of market interest rates, particularly short-term rates, to the
increased pressures on bank reserve positions of alternatives B and C may be
quite marked over the period ahead. Any rise in long-term rates, though,
might be muted as corporate borrowers back away from the market in anticipa-
tion of lower rates later.
","alternative

1981-11-17,14,"(14) Declines in market interest rates, both short- and long-term,
generally would be more modest under alternatives B and C than under alter-
native A, and potential downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets
would be reduced. Under B, Treasury bill rates would still likely reach
levels which, if sustained, would make thrift institutions generally pro-
fitable. Under alternative C, that might also develop, but it would be
less certain as the weight of Treasury financings and possible market
disappointment about the likely course of the funds rate (and hence of
dealer financing costs) would work to hold bill and other short-term
rates up. Thus, under C an easing in mortgage market conditions would be
relatively more delayed, both because of institutional uncertainty about
positive earnings and because long-term market rates may remain higher
than otherwise.
","alternative C"
1982-02-01,14,"(14) Alternative D specifies a 4 percent annual rate of growth
for February and March. Continuation of that growth rate over the balance
of the year would result in growth of M1 from QIV '81 to QIV '82 at about
the actual QIV '81 average level. Such a trajectory would be consistent
with a Committee decision to raise the upper limit of the tentative 1982
range or a decision to base the 2½ to 5½ percent range, not on the actual
QIV '81 level, but on, say, the lower limit of last year's longer-run
target range.1/ When the Committee established its tentative range for
of the long-run range for 1981 by the fourth quarter; an upward shift in
of the target range for M1-B shift-adjusted has to be raised by the
$11.3 billion of estimated shifts into NOW accounts from non-demand
deposit sources in 1981. This derived level would be $5.1 billion,
or 1.2 percent, higher than the actual (not shift-adjusted) level of
M1-B in the fourth quarter of 1981.
the base for the 1982 range would in that context indicate the Committee
was not willing to accept last year's undershoot and viewed the recent
increase in M1 as at least in part a desirable offset to the earlier short-
fall. With such a rebasing of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range for
bring M1 into the upper half of the rebased range by the fourth quarter of
this year. If alternative C were adopted in conjunction with a rebasing
of the long-run range, growth by the fourth quarter would be around the
midpoint of the range.
","alternative C"
1982-03-29,14,"(14) Alternative C, involving a 1½ percent rate of growth of
M1 over the March-to-June period, would require a growth in total reserves
at a 5½ percent rate. This alternative would appear to be consistent
with adjustment borrowing of near $1¾ billion, implying essentially no
growth in nonborrowed reserves. Under this approach, the federal funds
rate would likely rise into the 15 to 16 percent range over the inter-
meeting period. Such a rebound in the funds rate would probably lead
to a substantial rise in other short-term rates and renewed upward
pressure on long rates. These rate pressures might be moderated to the
extent that market expectations about the vigor of economic recovery and
future credit demands are dampened. The dollar would come under substantial
upward pressure in exchange markets.
","Alternative C"
1982-05-18,14,"(14) Alternative C, which calls for limiting M1 growth to a 1½
percent rate from March to June, implies an increase in total reserves
over the latter period at a 4 percent rate. Assuming adjustment borrowing
at around $1.1 billion, nonborrowed reserves would increase at only a
funds rate would probably be around the 14 to 14½ percent area, below
its range of recent weeks. Short- and long-term rates would likely show
little net change, since some easing in money market conditions has
probably been anticipated, and on balance the exchange rate would also
change little.
","Alternative C"
1982-06-30,14,"(14) Under alternative A, M1 over the next three months would
grow at a rate matching that of the upper bound of the Committee's current
longer-run range. Because such a trajectory would mean that there would
be no narrowing of the existing absolute gap relative to the top of the
range, alternative A might be viewed as especially consistent with a deci-
sion to raise the 1982 range or to tolerate a small overshoot. Under
alternative B, M1 would expand at a rate that, if sustained, would result
in growth for the year at about the 5½ percent upper bound of the longer-
run range, while alternative C contemplates growth in M1 which would move
the aggregate to just within this year's range by September. Under all
alternatives, the level of M2 by September would be around its upper limit--
a bit above in the case of alternative A and somewhat below in the case
of alternative C. (See charts on the next two pages).

1982-08-24,14,"(14) Alternative B, which calls for 4 percent growth in M1 over
the third quarter, likely would be consistent with a federal funds rate in
the vicinity of the current 10-1/2 percent discount rate. M1 would be
expected to grow at about a 6-1/4 percent annual rate on average in August
and September, with total reserves expanding at a 3-3/4 percent annual
rate over the balance of the quarter. Borrowing at the discount window
may be in the $350 to $400 million area.
","Alternative B"
1982-11-16,14,"(14) Under alternative A, we would expect the federal funds
rate to decline from its present level to the area of 8½ percent, with
total reserves rising at about an 8 percent annual rate in November and
December. Assuming such a decline in the funds rate, adjustment borrowing
would be at minimal levels ($150 million or less), given the present or
a somewhat lower discount rate. Nonborrowed reserves would rise at about
an 11½ percent annual rate over the balance of the year.
","alternative A"
1982-12-20,14,"(14) Total reserve growth at about a 6-1/2 percent annual rate
over the December '82 to March '83 period would probably be consistent with
the M2 and M3 specifications of alternative B. The relation of reserves
to M2 is more uncertain than usual, however, because of the wide range
of possible shifts of funds into or out of deposit accounts included in M1,
which bear sizable reserve requirements. If more funds than expected move
into super-NOW accounts, a larger growth in total reserves would be con-
sistent with any given growth of M2-and vice versa if more funds than
anticipated move out of M1 into MMDAs. For purposes of an initial estimate
of total reserves, we have assumed M1 growth from December to March at
about an 8 percent rate on the assumption, noted earlier, that shifts into
super-NOWs dominate shifts from Ml into MMDAs. We would anticipate non-
borrowed reserve growth under alternative B at about 8 percent over the
next three months, assuming borrowing from the discount window in the
neighborhood of $250 million.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1983-03-28,14,"(14) Alternative B contemplates a federal funds rate fluctuating
around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate, assuming adjustment (includ-
ing seasonal) borrowing at the discount window of around $200 million. Total
and nonborrowed reserves can be expected to rise from March to June at
annual rates of 6 and 7-1/2 percent, respectively, after declining on
balance over the previous three-month period largely because of deposit
mix changes related to introduction of MMDAs. The monetary base is
expected to grow about as rapidly as in the first quarter.
","Alternative B"
1983-05-24,14,"(14) While estimates of the relationship between the aggregates
and bank reserve positions are subject to considerable uncertainty, the
money supply specifications of alternative B are expected to be consistent
with little change in the current degree of restraint on bank reserve
positions--that is, with borrowing at the discount window fluctuating
around $250 million, associated with a federal funds rate generally just
above the current 8½ percent discount rate. Nonborrowed reserves in June
would be expected to expand at about a 9 percent annual rate, and total
reserves by about 6 percent.
","alternative B"
1983-07-12,14,"(14) To provide additional perspective for longer-run policy
decisions, the table on the next page shows projected impacts on real
GNP, prices, and interest rates of alternative approaches to the monetary
aggregates over the next several years. Strategy 1 reproduces the staff's
basic GNP forecast for this year and next (assuming 8½-percent M2 growth
this year and 8 percent next) and also shows projections through 1985 and
assumes more rapid money growth over the period through 1986, in this
case a continued 8½ percent M2 growth. Strategies 3 and 4 represent an
effort to depict policy approaches that show contrasts in the timing of
restraint and ease over the course of economic recovery. Strategy 3 aims
at a relatively stringent policy over the balance of this year and next
while easing off in 1985 and 1986; strategy 4 aims at the reverse
approach of easing over the balance of this year and next, and tightening
in the last two years shown. Strategy 3 assumes a reduction in M2 growth
to around 7¾ percent in 1983 and 1984 and an acceleration to around 8½
percent on average over the next two years, while strategy 4 assumes an
acceleration of M2 growth to around 9 percent in 1983 and 1984 and a decel-
eration to around 7½ percent in the next two years; in both strategies M2
growth was constrained to average a little over 8 percent over the 4-year
period. Differences between GNP, prices, and interest rates in strategy 1
and those in other strategies are based largely on model results, as is
the extension of strategy 1 into 1985 and 1986.
","alternative a"
1983-11-14,14,"(14) Market interest rates might tend to rise a bit under
alternative B, although the likelihood or extent of any such upward
pressure would depend in part on whether reserve paths led to federal
funds trading more consistently near 9-1/2 percent than has been the
case recently. In any event, credit markets will have to absorb a
large volume of new Treasury issues in a short period at a time when
private credit demands may be picking up. On balance, a 3-month Treasury
bill rate in an 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 percent range might be anticipated, with
bond yields unchanged or rising slightly.
","alternative B"
1984-03-26,14,"(14) The specifications of alternative A contemplate more
rapid growth of the aggregates, with M1 coming closer to the upper limit
of its longer-run range by June and M2 moving above its midpoint. M3
would probably tend to remain around the upper limit of its long-run
range. The near-term growth rates of this alternative-8 and 8-3/4 per-
cent for M1 and M2 respectively over the March-to-June period--would
probably involve a little less pressure on reserve positions over the
intermeeting period than has been evident most recently.
","alternative A"
1984-05-21,14,"(14) A considerable near-term rally would probably develop in
financial markets in response to the easing of money market conditions.
The Treasury bill rate would be likely to drop into the 9-1/4 to 9-1/2
percent area, and bond yields would also move downward. The size of the
decline in long rates might well be limited by larger corporate bond
offerings and by expectations that the lower level of money market rates
could not be sustained with economic activity still expanding rapidly and
credit growth strong relative to the Federal Reserve's range. M1 would be
in the middle of the upper half of its range by June under this alter-
native, but demand for this, and other, aggregates would be boosted in
the third quarter by the lower level of short-term interest rates that
developed as well as by a perhaps somewhat more robust expansion of economic
activity than now implied in the staff forecasts. Thus, alternative A
increases the odds that renewed tightening of money market conditions
might be necessary later in the year if the Committee wishes to hold M1
and M2 close to the midpoints of their ranges and M3 and credit to near
the upper ends of their ranges.
","alternative A"
1984-08-21,14,"(14) The easier reserve and market conditions that are expected
to develop under alternative A would probably have their greatest impact
on money growth in the final months of the year. The demand for money
would be stimulated by the lagged effect of lower market interest rates and
by transactions needs associated with somewhat faster expansion in nominal
GNP than in the staff forecast. Thus, alternative A seems most consistent
with Ml growth more clearly in the upper portion of its range for this
year and M2 growth around its midpoint. Expansion of both M3 and debt is
more likely to be somewhat further above the upper ends of their respective
long-run ranges than under alternative B as private credit demands respond
to the stronger economy.
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative B"
1984-11-07,14,"(14) Alternative A contemplates a more expansive reserve posture
that would encourage more rapid growth in M1 and M2. Growth of M1 over
the last two months of the year would be anticipated to be around 8-1/2
percent, encouraged by growth of nonborrowed reserves at a 15 percent annual
rate. Over the three-month September-to-December period, M1 would expand
at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and M2 at a 7-1/2 percent rate-still below
objectives set at the last meeting for M1 but on target for M2. Growth
of M3 may turn out to be somewhat further above the currently specified
credit expansion.
","Alternative A"
1984-12-17,14,"(14) Alternative A involves growth in the aggregates that
would bring them above the upper limits of their tentative longer-run ranges
(the width of the ranges of course being narrow early in the year). This
alternative may also be viewed as compensating in some degree for the
recent shortfall in M1 growth. For instance, the 8 percent growth of M1
over November to March that is specified would bring it by March to a
level that would be near the midpoint of the FOMC's tentative long-run
growth range if that range were based not on the actual fourth-quarter
average but on the fourth-quarter midpoint level of the 1984 long-run
range. The more rapid growth of M2 under this alternative would reflect,

1985-03-26,14,"(14) Alternative A contemplates some easing of pressures on
reserve positions, with borrowing dropping to around $200 million and the
federal funds rate declining to close to the 8 percent discount rate.
Total and nonborrowed reserves might increase at rates of 10 and 13 per-
cent, respectively, over the next three months. Other short-term interest
rates might fall sharply under this alternative, with the 3-month Treasury
bill rate dropping below 8 percent. The easing of money markets would
also tend to relieve the sensitivity of markets to the condition of
financial institutions. Bond yields, too, would drop, and in foreign
exchange markets, the dollar would fall substantially further.
","Alternative A"
1985-05-21,14,"(14) Alternative A contemplates lesser restraint on reserve
conditions than B. Borrowing would be expected to drop to around minimum
levels--perhaps around $200 to $250 million--and the federal funds rate
to fall to somewhat under the current 7-1/2 percent discount rate. Growth
of M1 from March to June would be expected to be around 7 percent, bringing
this aggregate to a level about 1/2 percent above the upper parallel band.
The further drop of interest rates expected under this alternative could
lead to substantial inflows into deposits and money funds, and growth in
M2 and M3 over May and June would probably pick up into a 7 to 8 percent
range. Interest rates and exchange rates would decline further, with the
three-month bill rate probably falling to near 7 percent.
Directive language
","Alternative A, alternative c"
1985-08-20,14,"(14) Alternative C assumes a tightening of reserve positions,
with borrowing rising to the $750 to $850 million area. The restrained
provision of nonborrowed reserves, with little net growth over August
and September, would lead to a rise in the funds rate to about 8-1/2
percent or somewhat higher and to a more rapid slowing of M1 growth. For
the June-to-September period, growth of M1 would still be relatively high,
about 8 percent. Expansion over the fourth quarter would be expected to
drop to an annual rate of near one percent as the cumulative impact of
higher interest rates, and perhaps some slowing of transaction demands
relative to the staff GNP forecast, takes hold. For the second half, M1
growth would be a little under 7-1/2 percent.
","Alternative C"
1985-10-01,14,"(14) Both total and nonborrowed reserves are likely to grow at
around a 7 percent annual rate over the final three months of the year,
given reserve pressures assumed under alternative B. With federal funds
trading persistently around 8 percent, other private short-term rates
would rise from current levels. A relatively larger upward adjustment of
bill yields could occur once the debt ceiling is raised and net issuance
of bills is resumed. The 3-month bill rate might increase to the 7-1/4
percent area. Bond yields would also rise, at least temporarily, as the
Treasury, partly because of debt ceiling problems, markets about $47
billion of notes and bonds ($26 billion for new cash) within a short
period in the latter part of October and early November. The firming of
interest rates that appears possible under this alternative could exert
sane upward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Under
those conditions, a continued decline in the dollar would depend in part
on the timing and extent of exchange market intervention activity. The
interaction between the dollar and interest rates is, of course, two-way.
As the dollar declines, interest rates could come under further upward
pressure, reflecting market concerns that more attractive returns would
be required on U.S. securities at a time when external financing needs
remained large and foreign investors may come to expect further exchange
","alternative B, alternative c"
1985-11-04,14,"(14) Alternative C assumes an increase in borrowing at the
discount window to the $700 to $800 million area, which would be expected
to involve federal funds trading around 8-1/2 percent. The tightening of
reserve conditions under this alternative would be expected to constrain
M1 growth to a 4 percent annual rate from September to December, bringing
this aggregate closer to, though still well above, its longer-term range.
In addition there would be greater assurance that M2 would be within
its long-run range for the year. An increase in the federal funds rate
in the near term is not now expected by the market, and consequently other
interest rates would move sharply higher under this alternative, particu-
larly in the short run as the market works through the large volume of
Treasury issues. The dollar could come under considerable upward pressure
in foreign exchange markets. Both long-term interest rates and the
dollar could retrace some of their immediate rise, however, if incoming
data suggested weakness in the economy.

","Alternative C"
1986-04-01,14,"(14) M1 growth would be expected to strengthen under alternative
A to around 9 percent over March to June, noving this aggregate further
above the upper end of its long-run range, though within its parallel band.
Even more rapid growth could occur, given the very narrow spread that
could develop between rates on market instruments, MMDAs and time deposits
and those on NOW accounts--especially if institutions are reluctant to
reduce the latter in the fluid competitive environment following full
deregulation. Strong demands for money may well continue later in the
year partly in lagged response to the rate declines associated with this
alternative. Under those circumstances, and particularly if transactions-
related demands were also on the strong side, greater restraint on reserve
positions and an increase in interest rates might be needed at some point
later in the year if M1 were to be constrained within its longer-run
range for 1986.
","alternative
A"
1986-08-19,14,"(14) Alternative A involves an easing of pressures on reserve
positions, either through a reduction in regular adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing to a frictional level of perhaps $150 million or so, or a cut in
the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point with discount borrowing maintained
at the current specification of $300 million. The federal funds rate would
probably decline to 5-3/4 percent or a little above. The associated decrease
in market interest rates would be expected to boost M2 growth to a little
over a 10 percent annual rate over the June-to-September period, moving this
aggregate to just below the upper end of its long-run range. There is a risk
that M2 growth could be even more rapid if institutions prove especially
reluctant to reduce offering rates on conventional NOW and savings accounts
as market rates drop closer to the previous regulatory ceilings of 5-1/4 and
any near-term easing in market conditions, M2 growth in the fourth quarter
could continue at a fairly rapid pace, absent a subsequent move toward more
reserve restraint; this would leave the aggregate around the upper end or
even somewhat above its long-run range for the year. M3 would grow at around
a 9-1/2 percent annual rate over the June-to-September period under this
alternative, entering the fourth quarter near the upper end of its annual
range. The risks of M3 running significantly above the upper end of its
annual range, even in the event of a surge in OCDs and savings deposits,
would be limited by offsetting reductions in issuance of managed liabilities
by banks and thrifts. M1 would be expected to increase at a 16 percent rate
between June and September under this alternative, moving even further above
the upper end of its range by the end of the quarter.
","Alternative A"
1986-09-23,14,"(14) Alternative A assumes either a reduction in discount borrow-
ings to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a one-half percentage
point cut in the discount rate with borrowings kept at $300 million. In
either case, the funds rate would gravitate into the 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent
area. Short-term market rates would adjust downwards, with the 3-month bill
rate likely moving below 5 percent. While bond yields might come down
initially, they would probably remain above the low points reached in
the spring; indeed, recent experience suggests some risk that long-term
yields could even back up in the face of a decline in short-term rates if
the easing in policy taken together with signs of strength in the economy
and prices exacerbated fears of inflation. Absent monetary easing abroad,
lower short-term rates would tend to lessen the attractiveness of dollar
assets, and any heightening of inflationary concerns in this environment
could place the foreign exchange value of the dollar under considerable down-
ward pressure.
","Alternative A"
1986-11-05,14,"(14) Alternative A assumes either a reduction in discount window
borrowing to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a cut in the discount
rate of one-half percentage point with borrowing maintained at $300 million.
In either event, the funds rate would move down to the 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent
area. Other short-term rates would also decline, with the three-month bill
rate dropping somewhat below 5 percent. The response of bond yields would
depend on indicators of the outlook for economic activity and prices.
Initially, bond yields might respond little to easier money market condi-
tions, but declines in short-term yields could reinforce tendencies for
longer-term yields to move lower if economic indicators pointed to a slug-
gish economy and little likelihood of greater underlying price pressures.
The dollar might weaken appreciably under this alternative, absent any
further easing actions abroad.
","Alternative A"
1986-12-15,14,"(14) Under alternative A, growth in M2 would slow only a little
from its average pace of recent months, and by March this aggregate would
be in the upper portion of its tentative long-run range. Growth in M3 would
strengthen a bit, but still would be below the midpoint of its tentative
range in March. M1 would be expected to expand at about the very rapid
pace of 1986. Unless greater interest cost pressures break the resistance
of banks and thrifts to lowering offering rates on savings deposits and
other liquid accounts, opportunity costs on these accounts would remain
very low--or even decline further--drawing funds from small time deposits
and the open market. M3 would tend to be boosted by inflows to money mar-
ket funds, as their yields lagged the decrease in market interest rates.
In addition, bank funding needs might be enlarged by more lending to busi-
nesses, especially if long-term rates did not similarly decline.
","alternative A"
1987-03-31,14,"(14) Alternative A assumes a reduction in discount window borrow-
ing to a near-frictional $150 million or a 50 basis point decrease in the
discount rate with borrowing maintained at $300 million. In either case,
the federal funds rate would decline to close to 5-1/2 percent. This easing
in money market conditions would be expected to bolster the expansion of the
aggregates, increasing the odds that M2 and M3 will be in the long-term
ranges at midyear, even if economic growth turns out to be somewhat weaker
than the staff projects. Without such unanticipated economic weakness, M2
growth would be expected to strengthen to a 7 percent annual rate over the
March-to-June period, and M3 to 6-1/2 percent, lifting both noticeably above
the lower boundaries of their long-run ranges by June. Flows into retail
accounts would strengthen again, boosted by lagging offering rates on these
accounts, especially OCDs and passbook savings. M1 likely would accelerate
appreciably over the coming months.
","Alternative A"
1987-05-19,14,"(14) The continued widening of opportunity costs of monetary
assets implied by alternative C would further depress demands for core
deposits, with M2 growth from April to June likely slowing to a 2-1/4 percent
pace. Growth at this rate would leave M2 at the lower end of the parallel
band associated with its longer-run range. The implied expansion--of around
the long-run range would seem to require a considerable easing of policy later
in the year. Transactions deposits would be especially affected by an upward
movement of market rates, which would substantially boost opportunity costs
on NOW accounts and constrain demand deposit growth partly because compensat-
ing balance requirements were reduced. M3 growth would be expected to remain
at about its April pace as bank credit growth stayed strong, placing this
aggregate at the lower bound of its long-run range in June.
","alternative C"
1987-08-18,14,"(14) Alternative A assumes adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
$300 million would be used to construct reserve paths. The federal funds
rate would fall to within a 6 to 6-1/4 percent range, probably gravitating
toward the lower end once the market perceived the extent of the easing of
reserve pressures. Other short-term rates would follow suit, with the 3-
month Treasury bill rate probably slipping to around 5-1/2 percent. Given
the easing of reserve pressures under this alternative, against the back-
ground of recent signs of monetary policy firming in some other major indus-
trial countries, the dollar probably would come under renewed downward pres-
sure. Bond market participants, recently preoccupied with inflationary con-
cerns, might react negatively to a less restrictive stance of Federal Reserve
policy, especially should it be accompanied by a substantial weakening of the
dollar. In such circumstances, bond yields might not fall much, if at all,
over the intermeeting period, absent a sharp break in oil prices.
","Alternative A"
1987-09-22,14,"(14) Under alternative C, M2 growth over the August-to-December
period would slow to about a 3-1/2 percent pace, as opportunity costs of
holding M2 balances widened substantially further. At the most liquid end of
the spectrum, M1 might expand only a little over this period, with demand
deposits declining. Banks and thrifts, faced with even smaller inflows to
core deposits, would step up their issuance of managed liabilities to fund
only marginally weaker credit demands, and M3 would expand at a 5-3/4 percent
rate over the August-to-December period, leaving growth for the year at 5-1/4
","alternative C"
1987-11-03,14,"(14) M3 growth over the fourth quarter at around 7 percent is
expected under alternative B, bringing growth for the year to 5-3/4 per-
cent, just within its annual range. Bank and thrift assets are expected
to grow at a moderate pace. The recent bulge in security loans at banks
is likely to be at least partly reversed; business loans might be fairly
strong, however, despite somewhat greater issuance of investment-grade
bonds, as inventory accumulation boosts financing needs and planned funding
with junk bonds of loans for leveraged buyouts is postponed. Overall, the
debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at around an
from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987.
","alternative B"
1987-12-15,14,"(14) The 1/2 percentage point lowering of the federal funds rate
under alternative A would bring it to the 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 percent area.
This probably would be associated with minimal borrowing in the near-
term and perhaps in a range around $150 million in the new year. Such
an easing is not expected by financial market participants, at least in
the absence of much hard evidence indicating that the stock market
decline or other factors have begun to retard spending significantly.
Choosing this alternative thus would depress short-term market rates
below recent levels, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate likely to
fluctuate around 5-1/2 percent. Yields on private short-term
instruments probably would decline by more, as the policy easing
improved prospects for continued economic expansion and helped relieve
worries about credit quality. Such an action would tend to restore
differentials between U.S. and European short-term interest rates to
levels prevailing before recent cuts in official lending rates abroad,
increasing downward pressure on the dollar. If inflationary concerns in
financial markets are intensified, declines in bond yields may be

1988-02-09,14,"(14) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented for con-
sideration by the Committee. Current reserve and money market conditions
would be maintained under alternative B while alternatives A and C would
involve somewhat easier or somewhat tighter conditions, respectively. The
level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing associated with alternative B,
$250 million, is expected to entail federal funds trading around recent
the funds rate would be broadly consistent with recent behavior but would
involve a lower amount of borrowing than indicated by model relationships,
reflecting some continued unusual reluctance by banks to borrow from the
window. Remaining uncertainties about the borrowing relationship, as well
as lingering sensitivities in financial markets, might call for some
continued flexibility in implementing open market operations. Alternative A
would be associated with a reduction in the federal funds rate of about 1/2
percentage point--achieved by a lowering of the borrowing objective to $100
million, a near-frictional level--or by a 1/2 percentage point cut in the
discount rate. Alternative C would be associated with an increase in the
borrowing objective to about $450 million and a rise in the federal funds
rate of approximately 1/2 percentage point.
","alternative B, alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative C"
1988-03-29,14,"(14) The more restrictive monetary posture of alternative C, at
least at this time, would come as some surprise to financial markets. With
the funds rate averaging around 7 percent, the 3-month Treasury bill rate
could move into an area around 6-1/4 percent. Rate spreads between bank
and thrift paper and Treasury bills could widen, if concerns about their
asset quality and earnings prospects intensify, which might be more likely,
given the already troubled status of many depository institutions. A good
portion of the increases in short-term rates might show through in longer-
term rates. But, an upward movement in U.S. interest rates, especially if
viewed as reflecting Federal Reserve resolve to avoid inflation and faster
external adjustment by containing domestic demand, would help to support
the dollar in the near term, and over time the net increase in bond yields
could be limited.
","alternative C"
1988-05-17,14,"(14) Alternative A would be implemented through restoring the
assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to the level of $200 mil-
lion that was in force from late January through late March, with federal
funds probably returning to the 6-1/2 percent trading area; even lower rates
could prevail if seasonal credit, which is now above $200 million, responded
relatively little to the decline in reserve pressures. Such a measure on
the heels of the two recent tightening steps clearly would be unexpected by
market participants and, in the absence of considerably weaker economic and
price data, might raise doubts about the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary
resolve. The exchange value of the dollar would come under strong downward
pressure, and there is some risk that heightened inflationary expectations
would have adverse implications for bond prices. The prospect that such a
policy easing could not long be sustained also would limit associated
declines in short-term interest rates, with the three-month Treasury bill
rate perhaps not falling much below 6 percent. This decline in money market
rates would encourage somewhat faster growth in the broader monetary
aggregates, although the March-to-June growth of M2 and M3 still would
remain well below their December-to-March pace, and in June these aggre-
gates still would be below the upper limit of their 4 to 8 percent long-run

","Alternative A"
1988-08-16,14,"(14) With the higher interest rates of alternative C, M2 is pro-
jected to record only 3 percent growth over August and September. The
upward movement of rates would slow M2 even further in the fourth quarter,
moving this aggregate appreciably below the midpoint of its annual growth
range. Growth of M3, by contrast, would probably not be damped enough
under alternative C to move below its midpoint, even by year-end. Long-
term debt issuance by businesses likely would be more restrained under
alternative C, shifting some business credit demands to banks, despite a
probable further increase in the prime rate.

1988-11-01,14,"(14) Under alternative A, money market interest rates would
decline about 1/2 percentage point, with the 3-month Treasury bill drop-
ping to a little below 7 percent. The dollar would come under sharp
downward pressure, especially in view of the remote prospects for a com-
parable easing of policy abroad. Long-term interest rates would decline
further but the extent of the drop might be limited by the weaker tone
of the dollar and would depend in any event on market interpretations as
to whether incoming data suggested a sustained easing of pressures on
domestic resources and prices. In the absence of particularly weak
economic data, the yield curve could steepen a bit.
","alternative A"
1988-12-13,14,"(14) Although market rates incorporate some near-term firming of
policy, an immediate rise in federal funds to the 8-7/8 to 9 percent area
associated with alternative C likely would elicit some further increase in
short-term market interest rates. Such increases, however, are likely to be
less than the nearly half point upward movement of the federal funds rate.
In addition, the prime rate would be boosted further. Long-term rates would
be likely to rise by somewhat less, especially if Federal Reserve actions
were seen as further reducing the potential for higher inflation. A dis-
count rate increase would be viewed as a more forceful step, prompting a
more immediate increase in short-term rates and one that might be larger as
well if markets interpreted it as portending even further policy tightening.
Downward pressure on the dollar would be offset, and the currency could even
firm for a time, especially if the tightening took the form of a discount
rate increase. Any upward pressure on the dollar would likely be mitigated
by firmer policy abroad, as foreign monetary authorities took advantage of
this opportunity to respond to the potential for inflation pressures in
their own economies.
","alternative C"
1989-03-28,14,"(14) The extent of immediate policy tightening embodied in alter-
native C is more than currently seems to be built into market interest
rates. In response to the federal funds rate moving into the 10-1/4 per-
cent area, other short-term market rates would be expected to rise some-
what less; the prime rate would be hiked again, probably by 1/2 percentage
point. The dollar would be expected to firm. Bond rates are likely to
increase under this alternative, but the extent of any rise might be
limited, and over time yields could drop back, if market participants saw
the tightening action as reducing the risks of greater inflation and
raising the odds on an appreciable moderation in economic growth. With
the further rise in market rates, M2 would expand at a 2 percent annual
rate over the March-to-June period under alternative C, only a bit faster
than the December-to-March pace. Growth at this rate would place this
aggregate noticeably below its 3 to 7 percent growth cone by June. Higher
market rates along with the lagged adjustment of offering rates on M3
type-money market mutual funds would weaken inflows to such funds. M3
expansion, at 4-1/2 percent over the March-to-June period, while picking
up some from the sluggish rate of recent months, would remain in the lower
portion of its long-run range.
","alternative C"
1989-08-22,14,"(14) The influence of the legislation on M3 will be considerably
larger. Those government funds not substituting for M2 liabilities will
be available to substitute for managed liabilities, including those in M3.
Moreover, assets held by insolvent thrifts will decline as these institu-
tions are liquidated or pared in size by RTC conservators; some assets
will be sold into markets and others may be acquired by the RTC, which
would fund them from non-M3 sources. Tighter capital requirements and
more restrictive asset standards also should hold down asset expansion at
other thrifts, whose sales of mortgage-backed securities may begin to be
supplemented by sales of junk bonds. While thrift RPs and large time
deposits should continue to decline, some of the reduction in managed
liabilities at thrifts will take the form of repayments of FHLB advances
and other non-M3 borrowing, muting the decline in M3.5 Moreover,
responding to the higher spreads on mortgages, banks are likely to absorb
a portion of thrift assets, boosting their needs for funds. On balance,
the thrift situation is projected to damp M3 growth by about 2 percentage
points in September to 5 percent under alternative B.
","alternative B"
1989-10-03,14,"(14) The tightening of policy under alternative C would come as a
surprise to the markets, especially in the present international environ-
ment. Money market interest rates would rise by around the 50 basis point
hike in the federal funds rate, and the dollar would strengthen. With
such a tightening not built into yield curves, bond rates would be
expected to firm somewhat in the near term as the market reassessed the
degree of aggressiveness by the System in pursuing its price stability
objective. M2 growth over the September-to-December period would slow to
a 5 percent rate. The composition of inflows would move toward small time
deposits, whose rates adjust more promptly, and away from liquid accounts;
its M1 component would slow to a 2-1/2 percent rate. The restraining
effects of higher interest rates and opportunity costs under this alterna-
tive should be sufficient to hold M2 to around the middle of its tentative
percent annual rate, ending the year very close to the lower end of its

","alternative C"
1989-11-14,14,"(14) Under alternative A, growth of M2 and M3 through December

rates and easing of lending conditions. September-to-December M2 and M3
growth would rise to 8 and 4-3/4 percent rates, respectively.
","alternative A"
1990-08-21,14,"(14) The easing of reserve market conditions under alternative A
would engender a like-sized decline in short-term interest rates. The
response of long-term interest rates to an easing is unclear. If incoming
information suggests sluggish economic growth or tighter credit condi-
tions, inflation concerns may not be heightened further by the policy
easing, and bond yields would fall. However, especially in the context of
the oil price shock, if the easing were interpreted as signalling greater
concern by the FOMC with maintaining output growth than with containing
inflation, the decline in the dollar could be particularly sharp, and bond
yields could rise. M2, and to a lesser extent M3, would be a bit stronger
under alternative A than with an unchanged funds rate; the staff projects
growth rates from June to September of 4-1/2 percent for M2 and 2-3/4
percent for M3.

fall at the midpoint of these ranges. The staff projection of M3, how-
ever, is lower in the provisional range. Alternative II allows for a
somewhat tighter policy stance by reducing the ranges uniformly by 1/2

tent with the 1 percentage point slower M2 growth of longer-run strategy
II in the preceding section. Alternative III permits a somewhat easier

1991-03-26,14,"(14) On a quarterly average basis, M2 under alternative B would
expand at a 6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, a shade faster
than nominal GNP. Expansion at this rate would be a bit higher than pre-
dicted by the staff money demand models, implying a partial makeup of the
shortfall of recent quarters. The projection thus assumes a continuation
of the very recent experience, in which some of the unusual factors that
of 5-1/2 percent over the March-to-June period, as transaction deposits
complete their adjustments to interest rate changes, and as currency
demand abates with the end of war-related uncertainties. The level of
demand deposits may be boosted to some degree by greater mortgage
refinancing at the reduced levels of rates on fixed-rate mortgages of
recent months; prepayments of securitized mortgages generally are held
in demand deposits for some time before being passed through to security
holders. However, at current interest rates, the effects of this on M1
growth rates are expected to be quite small in coming months. Growth of
the monetary base is expected to slow to a 5-1/4 percent rate in the
second quarter.
had been damping money growth in earlier quarters seem less pronounced.
The recent recovery in confidence by depositors and investors in the bank-
ing system is not expected to be reversed, and against this backdrop,
constriction of credit supplies by banks should not intensify. While
opportunity costs will rise as offering rates continue to adjust, they are
not expected to become unusually wide in coming months.
","alternative B"
1991-05-14,14,"(14) The lower market rates of alternative A would further en-
hance the attractiveness of retail deposits, likely boosting the average
growth of M2 in May and June to around a 5-1/2 percent rate, and to 4-1/2
percent from March to June. A lower prime rate, enhanced prospects for
a turnaround in output, and stronger prices of real assets would stimulate
demands for bank loans. But only a small impetus to bank credit expansion
would be given in the near term, partly because business borrowing likely
would remain focused on long-term markets, so the effect on M3 through
June would not be large. This aggregate's growth over the three months
ending in June, projected at a 2-1/4 percent pace, is only 1/4 percentage
point faster than under alternative B. For both aggregates, the major
effect of lower interest rates under alternative A would occur in the
third quarter; with no subsequent change in policy, M2 likely would end up
in the upper portion of its range by next fall, and M3 somewhat above the
midpoint of its range.

1992-03-31,14,"(14) Growth in M3 under alternative B would moderate slightly
to a 1-1/2 percent pace over the March-to-June period. In addition to
weaker M2 growth, M3 money funds should be about unchanged over the
second quarter under conditions of stable money market rates. On the
other hand, deposit inflows at banks might firm as their asset growth
strengthens a bit. With improving capital positions and better access
to funding markets, banks might become a little more willing to hold the
loans that they originate, rather than sell them. Demands for commer-
cial and industrial loans are likely to strengthen a little, as inven-
tory liquidation abates. Nonetheless, businesses are expected to con-
tinue to concentrate much of their financing in bond and equity markets
as they repair balance sheets. Net mortgage borrowing by households is
expected to rise, accompanying the recovery in housing activity, with
the bulk of these funds coming from the open market through mortgage
securities. Indebtedness of the nonfederal sectors should grow a little
faster over the March-to-June period, but, at only a 3 percent annual
rate of expansion, will remain quite anemic. Federal debt, in contrast,
will accelerate noticeably, boosting overall debt growth to a 6 percent
pace over the second quarter and lifting the debt aggregate to within
its 1992 monitoring range at quarter-end.
","alternative B"
1992-05-19,14,"(14) Under alternative B, the projected turnaround in M2 over
May and June should show through to M3, which is expected to register an
annual growth rate of 1-3/4 percent; from March to June, M3 would be
about unchanged. The slower expansion of M3 than of M2 would reflect
continued runoffs of large time deposits, as net credit extension at
depositories lags behind inflows to retail deposits. The decline of
business loans at banks might moderate as inventory liquidation slows
and banks become more willing to lend, especially to smaller businesses.
However, business credit demands are expected to be restrained overall,
as projected cash flow about matches capital spending, and to remain
focused on longer-term markets. The modest projected rise in spending
for new homes and durable goods, together with continuing cautious
attitudes toward debt, should limit household borrowing as well. Conse-
quently, growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to con-
tinue at only a 2-3/4 percent annual rate from March to June. Federal
debt, by contrast, is expected to post a more rapid 13 percent rate of
growth over these three months. Total domestic nonfinancial debt is
anticipated to expand at a little above a 5 percent rate over the second
quarter, lifting it in June to just above the lower bound of its 4-1/2
to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range.
","alternative B"
1992-08-18,14,"(14) The lower interest rates of alternative A would be
expected to buoy money growth over the balance of the year. Although
there is some question about the strength of the near-term response of
M2 to lower short-term rates, the anticipated decline in long-term
rates under this alternative should damp additional adverse yield
curve effects. Over time, the lower real and nominal interest rates
would raise income growth and, through that channel, further augment
demands for money, though the effects through year-end would be small.
The slightly faster growth in M2 deposits would feed through partly to
M3, as would relatively more attractive rates on M3 money funds,
leading to a resumption of 1 percent expansion in this aggregate over
the balance of the year.
","alternative A"
1992-10-06,14,"(14) The immediate 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal
funds rate under alternative A would exceed the market's expected
change. Short-term market interest rates would decline by as much as
maintaining an unusually wide spread over funding costs. The dollar
probably would depreciate somewhat further; since the policy easing
would occur in a situation of persistent macroeconomic slack and ongo-
ing disinflation, the decline in the dollar is most likely to be con-
tained. In such circumstances, long-term market rates probably would
move still lower, pulled down by the weight of a reduced expected path
for short-term rates over at least the intermediate term.
","alternative A"
1992-11-17,14,"(14) Two alternatives are presented below for the Committee's
consideration. Under alternative B, the trading range for the federal
funds rate would remain centered at 3 percent, in conjunction with an
initial assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $75 mil-
lion.6  The policy ease envisaged under alternative A would trim the
expected federal funds rate to 2-1/2 percent. In keeping with the usual
practice of holding the expected federal funds rate at or above the
discount rate, this change could be effected by lowering the discount
rate by 1/2 percentage point while retaining the borrowing assumption at
$75 million. Technically, though, the lower federal funds rate of
alternative A could be achieved by reducing the borrowing assumption
$25 million with an unchanged discount rate.

1992-12-22,14,"(14) M2 is projected to expand at only a 1 percent rate from
November-to-March under alternative C and M3 would decline at a 1/4
percent rate. M1 growth would be limited to 4 percent over November-to-
March by the higher opportunity costs of demand deposits and NOW ac-
counts under this alternative. Losses on capital market instruments as
long-term rates rise could limit flows into bond and stock mutual funds,

the pickup in M2, as managed liabilities in M3, including large time
deposits, should resume running off over the two months. Bank credit
expansion is expected to remain moderate, with loan growth quite weak,
and the balance sheets of thrift institutions are anticipated to con-
tinue to contract. While inflows of core deposits are projected to meet
most of the added funding needs of banks and S&Ls, banks are likely to
obtain some funding from abroad and from other nondeposit sources, in
part to avoid higher deposit insurance premiums. Looking further ahead,
moderate average growth of M3 during the third quarter would be expected
to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative B over that

1993-08-17,14,"(14) Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw a
need to move sooner, rather than later, to contain or reduce future
inflationary pressures. An outlook for economic growth and inflation
stronger than in the staff forecast would bolster the rationale for a
policy firming action. Such an outlook might follow from a view that
the more aggressive posture being adopted by banks and other lenders
would provide, with lags, considerable stimulus to the economy and
prices. With the staff's outlook for spending propensities, M2 would
expand at only a 1 percent pace over the final five months of this year
under alternative C, ending the year about 3/4 percent above its fourth-
quarter 1992 level. Growth in this aggregate would be restrained not
only by larger opportunity costs but also by slower income growth as
year-end approached. Weaker M2 would show through to M3 which would be
about flat over the remainder of the year.

","Alternative C, alternative C"
1993-12-21,14,"(14) Alternative A might be favored if the current strength
in the economy were seen as likely to give way to a significant weak-
ening in the pace of expansion next year, considering the greater
fiscal restraint in train and the backup in long-term interest rates
and the dollar since mid-October. Moreover, even if the staff fore-
cast is judged to be the most likely outcome, the lack of much pro-
gress in reducing the unemployment rate may be deemed to be unaccep-
table. Moreover, recent softness in the oil market could suggest
lessened risk to the inflation outlook from an easing, at least in the
near term.

","Alternative A"
1994-05-17,14,"(14) The case for standing pat, alternative B, is a more
extreme version of the rationale for alternative C: In this case, the
market assessment, and even that of the staff, of the strength of
aggregate demand would be judged to be seriously off the mark, perhaps
because the rise in long-term rates, along with the decline in house-
hold wealth, will have a more significant restraining influence on
aggregate demand. Choice of alternative B would come as a consider-
able surprise--and disappointment--to financial markets; very short-
term interest rates would be likely to fall appreciably, but this
alternative risks a significant sell-off in the bond market before
weakness in aggregate demand becomes apparent.

that deposit rates will continue to adjust sluggishly to market rates.

In addition, declines in mortgage prepayments will continue to depress
demand deposits. These factors will place a particular drag on liquid
accounts, and M1 will expand at only a 2-1/2 percent rate over the
period.6 While the growth of small time deposits should remain
robust, not all the funds lost from liquid deposits will remain in M2.
Direct purchases of securities, including noncompetitive tenders at
Treasury auctions, are anticipated to continue at a healthy clip. As
a result, M2 velocity is expected to continue increasing rapidly in
the fourth quarter--at a rate near 5 percent. M3 growth should pick
up a bit over the remainder of 1994, reflecting somewhat reduced
reliance of banks on nondeposit sources of funding.

1994-12-20,14,"(14) Projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
November to March are shown below under both alternatives. (More
detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following pages.)
The staff expects the growth of the monetary aggregates to remain
damped over coming months, restrained by prior (and under alternative
C, current) increases in opportunity costs. Nonetheless, growth rates
for the aggregates generally are a little faster than envisioned in
November. Expansion in nominal income is now seen as stronger over
the late months of 1994 and early months of 1995. In addition, the
broader aggregates are likely to be buoyed slightly by shifts from
longer-term mutual funds in the wake of less attractive returns and
unfavorable publicity; however, with deposit rates still well short of
market rates, most of the savings diverted from mutual funds is likely
to continue to go into direct purchases of securities.

would pick up to a 2-1/2 percent rate, while average M3 growth would

near the top, of their respective 1-to-5 percent and 0-to-4 percent
annual growth ranges. Somewhat slower growth in the monetary aggre-

","alternative B"
1995-09-26,14,"(14) The 1/2 percentage point policy tightening of alterna-
tive C could be favored if the inflation performance projected by the
staff to accompany an unchanged federal funds rate were seen as repre-
senting an insufficiently rapid approach to the Committee's ultimate
objective of price stability. Indeed, the staff forecast shows very
little downward tilt to inflation rates. Moreover, the current un-
employment rate is a little below the staff's estimate of the NAIRU,
and economic growth going forward at a pace below potential is by no
means assured--especially in light of current bond rates and stock
prices. On the basis of relationships embodied in the Greenbook
alternative simulation, a policy tightening of the dimensions of
alternative C would nudge economic growth to below 2 percent over the
next two years, opening up enough slack in labor and product markets
to make more noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and
","alternative C"
1995-11-15,14,"(14) A move to tighten policy by 50 basis points as under
alternative C would especially surprise market participants, who con-
tinue to hold the view, supported by statements from some Committee
members, that the next policy move will be to ease. Money market
rates would rise by at least the 50 basis point increase in the fed-
eral funds rate. The dollar would tend to strengthen on foreign
exchange markets, and intermediate- and long-term interest rates would
retrace some of their recent declines as a higher path for real short-
term rates came to be built into market expectations.
","alternative C"
1995-12-19,14,"(14) The FOMC might select alternative C if it saw the risks
to inflation at current interest rates as reasonably well balanced and
wished to gain more assurance of making longer-term progress toward
price stability. Despite declines this year, survey-based measures of
inflation expectations have only reached levels of recently observed
inflation and still do not anticipate further disinflation. Given the
demand and inflation relationships incorporated in the staff forecast,
the rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C would tilt the
inflation rate down slightly in 1997. With the economy already
operating in the neighborhood of its potential and aggregate demand
possibly bolstered by the sharp declines in interest rates of the past
year, an increase in inflationary pressures cannot be ruled out.
Although growth of the standard monetary aggregates has been slow
recently, the broad aggregates have expanded fairly briskly for 1995
as a whole, and credit through intermediaries and in the securities
markets remains readily available.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1996-12-17,14,"(14) Under alternative B and the staff forecast, both debt and money should
expand at moderate rates in coming months, in line with projected nominal GDP. For
the debt of nonfinancial sectors, the outlook implies a slight pickup in growth from the
pace of recent months to a 4-3/4 percent rate from November to March. The contri-
bution by governments at all levels should remain relatively modest, as state and local
governments retire debt out of the proceeds of advanced refundings and the federal
government continues to pare its budget. But somewhat stronger borrowing is
expected by nonfinancial firms facing a widening financing gap, and household sector
borrowing should bounce back somewhat, with debt growth more consistent with
moderate increases in spending and income.
","alternative B"
1997-05-20,14,"(14) The runoff of the tax-related deposit surge of April should be completed in
May, after which the monthly growth of M2 and M3 under alternative B is expected to
stabilize at annual rates of 4-1/2 and 6 percent, respectively, through September--somewhat
below the pace of the first five months of the year. Quarterly average growth of M2 in the
second and third quarters would be a touch below the staffs projected average pace for
nominal GDP of 4-1/4 percent over the two quarters, reflecting the lagged effects of higher
opportunity costs stemming from the policy firming in March. M3 growth is expected to ease
slightly, though still remain strong. Rapid money fund growth and some further shifting
toward large time deposits and away from overseas funding of bank assets will continue to
sustain growth in this aggregate, even in the face of a substantial slowing in bank credit
growth. As shown in the charts, the staff anticipates that M2 will have grown at a 4-3/4
percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1996 through September, just below the 5 percent
upper end of its annual range, while M3 will have expanded at a 6-3/4 percent rate over the
same period, well above the 6 percent upper bound of its annual range.

1998-03-31,14,"(14) Under the conditions of alternative B, the moderating pace of spending in the
staff forecast should be accompanied by considerably slower growth in debt and money. The
bulk of the slowdown in nonfederal debt growth will likely be accounted for by the business
sector; the financing gap is not projected to increase any further in coming quarters, and
borrowing in recent months has been well above staff assessments of needs to cover mergers
and acquisitions and the shortfall of internal funds from capital outlays. While some new
caution by lenders is likely to surface as economic growth slows and profits soften, this shift
in attitudes is expected to have only a marginal restraining influence on business credit
growth. In the household sector, growth of debt is projected to continue to be well
maintained--outpacing that of disposable personal income-led by brisk mortgage borrowing
as housing markets remain strong and as refinancing is associated with some further equity
extraction. By September, debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to have grown at
a 5-1/2 percent rate from its fourth quarter 1997 base, above the midpoint of its 3 to 7 percent
annual range.
","alternative B"
1998-05-19,14,"(14) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to slow significantly to a 3 percent
average rate over the April-to-September period, with a little more than 1 percentage point of
the slowdown from the first four months of 1998 representing the projected unwinding of the
previous artificial boost related to special tax and mortgage-refinancing factors. Even so, over
the second and third quarters, M2 growth averaging 5 percent on a quarterly average basis is
projected to exceed the 4 percent average rate of nominal GDP expansion, implying a further
implied M2 growth would be at a 5-3/4 percent rate. Looking a little further out, the staff now
envisions growth of this aggregate for the year at a 5-1/2 percent rate, putting it above the 1 to
and stable velocity behavior; this projection embodies a 1 percent decline in velocity in 1998.
","alternative B"
2001-01-30,14,"(14) If the Committee found the staff assessment o f the outlook to  be both
reasonable and acceptable, it might opt for alternative A, which would lower the
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5¾ percent.  In the context of this forecast, such
an easing leans against softness in aggregate demand while resisting an eventual pickup
of inflation in circumstances of continued pressures on labor resources.  In light of
the considerable uncertainty about the prospects for spending, such a measured step
could be seen  as striking a balance between two possible scenarios for aggregate
demand discussed earliera recession and a growth pause.  To be sure, the market has
a more substantial easing at this meeting built into interest rates, but this expectation
was shaped in part by the Committee s unexpectedly aggressive action earlier this
month.  Over a som ewhat longer horizon, the structure of interest rates incorporates
a drop in the funds rate to 4¾ percent by year-endmore than  the Committee may see
as likely to be necessary to restore acceptable growth.  If so, it may view disappointing
markets a little as possibly fostering more sustainable and stabilizing financial
conditions.  Indeed, the Committee may be concerned that another 50 basis point
action hard on the heels of the January 3 move risks leading investors to expect even
more ease at future meetings than currently.  Such a reaction would heighten the
possibility that the stimulus emanating from financial markets would give additional
impetus to a rebound in  spending that might soon be underway in any event.  Given
the lags in the effects of monetary policy, any resulting price pressures could be
difficult to contain even with a relatively quick turnaround in po licy.
","alternative A"
2004-03-16,14,"(14) With this view, the Committee might wish to issue a statement structured
like that shown in Alternative A.  The Committee could convey a sense of its concerns
through a somewhat less sanguine assessment of the labor market in the rationale
paragraph.  The third sentence could drop the reference to other indicators pointing to
improvement in labor markets and state simply that New hiring has been disappointing.
Adding a clause to this sentence suggesting that . . .and resource utilization generally appears
likely to remain somewhat below levels consistent with the economy operating at its productive potential
for some time would underscore the Committees concern about economic slack.  The
Committees assessment could be amplified still more by modest revisions to its
characterizations of the balance of risks.  For example, the Committee might note that
the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months but
likely exceeds that of a rise in inflation.  Interest rates would probably move a bit lower
following an announcement of this sort.  Equity prices might be buoyed somewhat if
the statement was read primarily as reaffirming the FOMCs resolve to foster
sustainable output growth at a pace sufficient to eliminate economic slack.  The rise in
stock prices could be damped or even reversed, however, if investors took the
statement as implying higher odds that the vigor of economic growth could wane over
coming quarters.
Money and Debt Forecast
","Alternative A"
2004-05-04,14,"(14) If the Committee finds sufficient merit in the selection of Alternative A,
it could issue a statement like that shown in the corresponding column of Table 1.
While the recent increase in inflation should be noted, the statement could indicate
that the rise is likely to be transitory: Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat
higher, core inflation is expected to remain low.  Even in this view, the risks to the
attainment of price stability related in the assessment of risks paragraph would
presumably be balanced.  However, with the vigor of the expansion seen as less
certain and the upside risks to inflation less pressing, the Committee might choose to
retain with only minor adjustment the sentence indicating its belief that it can be
patient in removing its policy accommodation.  Market participants think that the
Committee is likely to modify or drop the reference to patience in the statement at
this meeting, and its retention would probably lead them to push back somewhat the
expected timing of policy tightening.  The resulting decline in market interest rates
would likely spark a modest rally in stock markets but weigh on the foreign exchange
value of the dollar.

2004-06-29,14,"(14) In announcing implementation of Alternative B, the Committee would
presumably want to modify its existing indication that the accommodative stance of
policy is providing important support to economic activity but could retain the
associated point regarding the impetus given by productivity.  One way to accomplish
this is to say that . . . even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative

and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic
activity.  Assuming that the Committee agreed on a modest move toward restraint in
part because it viewed inflation prospects as relatively benign, the statement could
note that, although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in
recent months presumably has been due to transitory factors.  Under this alternative, the
Committee would probably again see the risks to sustainable growth as balanced if its
outlook for growth did not differ much from that at the May meeting.  Similarly, the
Committee might continue to view the risks to price stability as balanced in light of its
step to begin removing policy accommodation.  In view of the recent inflation
surprises, though, as well as the relatively small adjustment to the nominal funds rate
under this alternative in comparison with the acceleration in prices that has already
occurred, a case could be made for characterizing the risks to inflation as tilted to the
upside and for jettisoning the language that policy accommodation could be removed
at a measured pace.  However, if the Committee sees the risks as balanced, it might
prefer to guard against an exaggerated market reaction by reaffirming its view that,
given relatively low underlying inflation and continued resource slack, it need not
tighten policy aggressively.  The Committee could retain the measured language while
emphasizing the conditional nature of its expectation for policy and underscoring its
commitment to price stability by saying,With underlying inflation still expected to be
relatively low, the Committee judges the outlook to be such that policy accommodation can be removed
at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in
economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability so as to foster
maximum sustainable economic growth.
","Alternative B"
2004-09-21,14,"(14) The Committee may be concerned that greater-than-usual uncertainty
surrounds the outlook for the economy as spending moves out of its recent soft
patch.  If the Committee put much weight on the possibility that growth will rebound
sharply, it may believe that the scope of its future action is constrained on the upside
by the measured pace language and may prefer to drop the last two sentences from
the statement, as is considered in Alternative C.  Monetary policy has been highly
accommodative for an extended period, and as noted, the real federal funds rate is
currently about zero and may well be considerably below its equilibrium level.  Indeed,
given the decline in longer-term yields and increases in equity prices, financial
conditions likely eased further over the intermeeting period.  Policymakers may be
concerned that this monetary stimulus could be stoking a buildup of overall
inflationary pressures or fostering misalignments of asset prices.  As to the former, if
the prospects for aggregate supply were described not by the Greenbook baseline but
by the Less room to grow alternative simulation (in which the NAIRU is higher and
the labor force participation rate does not rise any further to augment labor inputs),
then the Committee might envision more forceful action sometime soon.  As to the
latter concern about asset prices, some could view the rapid rise in home values,
which presumably is being fed in part by the low level of real interest rates, as a
possible manifestation of misallocation of resources and a potential threat to financial
stability (see box).  Removing the measured pace language would capture market
attention and result in a tightening of financial market conditions that would provide
some restraint on asset prices and inflation.
Housing Prices and Monetary Policy
Over the last several years, real home prices in the United States have increased sharply
(left panel).  Moreover, house prices have risen well above gains in rents, indicating either an
expectation of future significant increases in rents, a lowered risk premium, or a decline in the
risk-free rate of discount.  In any case, and as shown in the right panel, the price-rent ratio has
moved well above its typical range, potentially raising some of the same challenges for monetary
policy posed by the stock market boom in the late 1990s.  With the value of homes accounting
for about a quarter of household assets, changes in their prices could well have an appreciable
effect on spending.  In addition, a significant misalignment of housing prices could prompt
resource misallocations.  Housing prices, however, are much less volatile than equity prices,
suggesting that these developments would tend to unfold slowly, if at all.
Such concerns have led some observers to argue that the FOMC take more explicit
account of perceived deviations of house prices from fundamentals in formulating monetary
policy.  In particular, advocates of such an approach generally argue that it may be desirable to
tighten more aggressively at present than would otherwise be the case so as to contain or even
reverse the perceived asset price misalignment and thereby avoid an especially sharp and painful
asset price correction at some future date.
An alternative view is that monetary policy should respond to perceived asset price
misalignments only to the extent that they contain information about the outlook for inflation
and output.  Moreover, the available empirical evidence demonstrates only that asset (house)
prices are high compared with predicted values from models based on historical behavior. 
Models, however, are imperfect, and consequently it remains a judgment call whether this
deviation really represents a departure from fundamentals or is a manifestation of changed
fundamentals not fully accounted for by the model.
Even if house prices were known with certainty to be overvalued, the appropriate policy
response is not obvious. More aggressive policy tightening might reduce the demand for real
estate and gradually bring home prices in line with fundamentals, although the appropriate degree
of tightening would be difficult to calibrate.  If the misalignment, however, were viewed as likely
to correct itself in short order, it might well be appropriate to ease policy (or tighten less
aggressively) to cushion the expected fall in demand.  Given such uncertainties, the standard
prescription is that monetary policy should be driven primarily by economic fundamentalsthe
outlook for output and inflationeven when home prices or other asset prices may not be.

raising the federal funds rate target to 2½ percent at this meeting and the release of a
statement little changed from that in December.  Alternative A presents a stance of
policy that is easier in multiple dimensions, in that the federal funds rate is held at its
current level, the assessment of the current degree of accommodation is softened, and
language that could be associated with a pause is offered.  In stark contrast,
Alternative C envisions a half-point rate hike accompanied by a darker assessment of
inflation risks and the removal of the measured pace language.  No doubt, the
extremes are extreme, but they contain elements of statement language that the
Committee might find more appealing than the wording of Alternative B.  In addition,
these alternatives may be helpful in informing potential changes in the policy
announcement over the next few meetings.  All the alternatives suggest stating that
Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices,
which differs from the December announcement only by dropping the word earlier
in recognition of recent increases in oil prices.

2005-03-22,14,"(14) If the Committee instead views recent higher inflation readings as largely
transitory, it may wish to firm policy by a quarter point at this meeting and issue a
statement like that described under Alternative A.  With longer-term inflation
expectations well-contained and resource slack apparently being worked down slowly,
the Committee may see relatively little cost in continuing along a path of gradual
removal of policy accommodation.  Indeed, the Committee may want to choose the
words of its statement so as to keep market participants from marking up their
expected path of tightening.  This might be so even if the Committee anticipates that
resource slack is likely to be eliminated fairly soon, if it also saw downside risks to that
forecastsuch as are discussed in the higher bond premiums scenario in the
Greenbookas significant given the recent run-up in interest rates and rise in oil

but is concerned that spending and output growth may have lost significant
momentum of late and that progress in reducing resource slack may have stalled, it
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 40
may wish to combine a 25-basis-point firming of policy at this meeting with
statement language that strongly suggests the possibility of a pause in firming at the
June meeting, as in Alternative A.  True, the Committee has repeatedly conveyed in
its minutes that the measured pace language is consistent with a pause in the
process of tightening, and market participants have priced in high odds of such a
possibility later this year.  But it cannot be ruled out that the present configuration
of market prices is conditioned on the expectation that the statement will be used to
signal the possibility of a pause in policy tightening.  If so, the Committee might see
merit in being more explicit.  A more gradual elimination of accommodation might
be appealing in light of the downward revision of nearly ¾ percentage point in the
short-run measure of the equilibrium real interest rate consistent with the
Greenbook forecast (the first line in the table in Chart 5); by that index, the real
funds rate would be less than ¼ percentage point below its estimated equilibrium
value after implementation of this alternative.  In addition, a 3 percent nominal
federal funds rate would sit high in the range of policy recommendations from
simple policy rules provided in Chart 6and especially so if members viewed
of the risks to the outlook for spending would presumably also incline the
Committee to signal a pause.  For instance, economic activity could be weaker in
coming quarters than in the staff forecast for the reasons explored in the sentiment
slump and sentiment slump with financial spillover scenarios in the Greenbook.
As another possibility, members may be of the view that the slowing in spending
and activity of late owes less to elevated energy prices and more to the cumulative
monetary policy restraint put in place since June of last year than is implicit in the
Greenbook. 5   Pausing to assess the effects already in the pipeline from cumulative

policy restraint might therefore be in order, especially in light of the recent behavior
of the stock market, bond spreads, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
","Alternative A"
2005-06-29,14,"(14) The announcement associated with Alternative B would update the wording
of the May statement in view of incoming data on spending, output, and employment
but would leave the rest of the statement unchanged.  As shown in Table 1, the
statement would indicate that Growth in spending slowed somewhat in the spring,
and energy prices have risen further.  Nonetheless, recent data suggest that the
expansion remains solid and that labor market conditions continue to improve
gradually.  Regarding inflation, it would modify slightly the wording used in May to
say that Pressures on inflation have stayed elevatedan indirect reference to even
higher energy prices and slightly reduced economic slackand delete the mention of
pricing power, a phenomenon that appears to have received less attention of late.
The recent evidence on long-term inflation expectations has been good, with readings
from TIPS down appreciably over the intermeeting period and survey-based measures
ticking down after rising a bit earlier in the spring.  These circumstances might be seen
as consistent with a reiteration of the view that longer-term inflation expectations
remain well contained.  With events thus far unfolding broadly in line with the
Committees expectations, it might again indicate that . . . with appropriate monetary
policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable
growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  On the same logic, the
Committee might again be comfortable expressing an expectation that the removal of
policy accommodation could likely proceed at a measured pace.

","Alternative B"
2005-08-09,14,"(14) The draft statement associated with Alternative A could indicate that The
Committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has been
substantially reduced, while again acknowledging that the expansion remains firm
and that labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.  Particularly if the
Committee were concerned about a possible slackening in the pace of trend
productivity growth, it might wish to eliminate the previous language pointing to
robust underlying productivity growth as a factor supporting the expansion.  With
regard to prices, the statement could indicate that Core inflation has been relatively
low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained,
dropping the reference to inflation pressures.  In the penultimate sentence, the
FOMC could indicate that remaining policy accommodation can likely be removed
at a measured pace.  Alternatively, if the Committee judged that the real federal funds
rate now was in the neighborhood of its equilibrium level, it might choose to drop the
measured pace sentence entirely, thus suggesting that further firming could prove to
be unnecessary.
","Alternative A"
2005-09-20,14,"(14) The Committee, in contrast, could arrive at a decision to keep the federal
funds rate unchanged for several reasons.  One possibility is that, while generally
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 38
accepting the economic outlook discussed under Alternative B, members may harbor
the reservation that there is a small probability that the disruption to economic activity
in the Gulf region and sapping of consumer and business confidence nationwide
could have serious consequences for the broader economy.  While the mean (or
modal) outlook might be taken as a reason to tighten, consideration of that adverse
tail may counsel delaying further firming for a time.  Under Alternative A, the
Committee would keep the target federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this
meeting and use the statement to explain that it was merely deferring firming in light
of the elevated uncertainties, and likely not ending the tightening cycle.  As in
Alternative B, the Committee could note the adverse near-term effects of the
hurricane on spending, production, and employment, but not include the sentence
suggesting that the effects will be temporary.  The text on inflation in Alternative B
could also be used in Alternative A.

2005-11-01,14,"(14) Market participants would be surprised by the removal of the measured
pace and policy accommodation language and, perhaps, by the explicit indication that
additional firming was likely to be necessary.  With a 25 basis point move and the
language proposed under Alternative C, short-term interest rates and the exchange
value of the dollar would likely rise, while stock prices would fall.  If markets revised
down their outlook for longer-term inflation as a result of the statement, however,
longer-term interest rates might increase only a little.  With a 50 basis point firming,
market participants would likely raise their sense of inflation risks and the near-term
path of expected monetary policy substantially; short- and intermediate-term market
interest rates would jump, the dollar would rally, and the stock market could sell off
","Alternative C"
2005-12-13,14,"(14) Market participants uniformly expect a 25 basis point rate hike at this
meeting.  The desks survey of primary dealers indicates that most anticipate deletion
or modification of the references to accommodative policy and that about half
anticipate that the Committee will drop or modify the measured pace phrase.  But
market participants appear not to foresee a change in the formulation of the
assessment of risks at this meeting.  Given the extent of the changes proposed for
Alternative B, it is difficult to be confident of how the new statement will be
interpreted by investors.  On the one hand, the rationale portion of the statementby
downplaying the adverse effects on activity of higher energy prices and the hurricanes,
and pointing to increases in resource utilization as a potential source of inflation
pressuremay be seen as somewhat hawkish, leading investors to mark up their path
for policy.  On the other hand, the indication in the risk assessment that some
further measured tightening is likely to be needed to keep risks balanced would seem
to be roughly congruent with current market expectations for policy.  And the fact
that the Committee was making substantial changes to the statement might be seen by
investors as a sign that it expected to stop tightening soon.  On balance, policy
expectations could move a little higher, causing modest increases in interest rates,
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 42
declines in stock prices, and strengthening of the dollar.  These market effects could
be somewhat larger if the removal of the reference to policy accommodation,
coupled with the concerns expressed about the potential inflationary effects of
increases in resource utilization, led some market participants to conclude that the
Committees intent was not merely to bring the real funds rate to a neutral level but
rather to move toward outright policy restraint.

may be sufficient, at least for a time, to keep both inflation and inflation expectations
contained in the face of increased energy prices and diminishing resource slack, it may
prefer Alternative B.  While the staff has penciled in an assumed additional
tightening after this meeting, it also assumes that the move will be reversed next year.
The Committee might believe that the relatively benign macroeconomic outcomes of
the Greenbook could be achieved by validating current market expectations of both a
¼ percentage point firming on Tuesday and two-thirds odds on a like-sized move in
March.  As shown in Chart 7, this policy move would place the real funds rate about
at the center of the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value.  While the
Greenbook projections for economic growth and inflation have been revised up for
this year, the current level of the output gap is slightly wider owing to a greater-than-

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding models projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.
Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

anticipated deceleration of production in the fourth quarter of last year.  In
consequence, Committee members may view the need for further policy firming after
this meeting to be about as they had expected in December.  Even if members are
fairly confident that an additional firming step will be necessary at the March meeting,
they may view this as an appropriate time to begin to wean market participants from
explicit characterizations of future interest rate action in the statement as a matter of
routine.  On that score, the attendant increase in expected interest rate volatility might
be seen as engendering a more healthy respect for risk in financial markets.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2006-03-27,14,"(14) The rationale paragraph in Alternative C does not directly refer to the
slowing of growth in the fourth quarter of last year, observing only that economic
growth has now rebounded to a solid pace.  The discussion of inflation risks does not
reference the limited pass-through of cost pressures or ongoing productivity gains, as
in Alternative B, and instead simply concludes that As yet, however, inflation
expectations remain contained.  This might be read as a signal that the Committee is
worried that inflation expectations could soon become unmoored.  In addition, the
modifier some limiting the extent of additional tightening in the January statement
has been dropped, suggesting that more substantial tightening could be in store.
","Alternative C, Alternative B"
2006-05-10,14,"(14) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph could indicate that spending is
likely to slow because of a cooling of the housing market and the restraint imparted by
increases in energy prices and interest rates.  The Committee could repeat its analysis
in the March statement of recent factors affecting inflation, but then acknowledge that
a slight rise in inflation expectations could also add to inflation pressures.  To treat its
dual objectives symmetrically, row 3 includes the Committees expectation that core
inflation will remain contained, just as there is forward-looking language on economic
growth in the previous row.  In view of the additional quarter-point firming that
would be implemented under this alternative, the risk assessment might be softened a
little relative to that released after the last meeting by adding The Committee judges
that any additional firming is likely to be modest and adopting some of the language
of the Chairmans recent testimony:  the extent and timing of any such firming will
depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming
information.  Inclusion of the reference to timing is intended to suggest that
additional firming would not necessarily take place at the June meeting.  If the
Committee saw only a small probability that it would act again in June, it could tune
the message by replacing the second sentence of row 4 with The Committee judges
that additional firming, if any, is likely to be modest.  In either case, the dependency
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 41
of future policy actions on data could be underscored by essentially reiterating the
final sentence from the March announcement.
","Alternative B"
2006-06-28,14,"(14) If the Committee finds the staff forecast both probable and as desirable as
can be achieved in current circumstances, it may choose to tighten policy 25 basis
points at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  A 25 basis point firming would raise the
real federal funds rate somewhat above most of the staffs estimates of the
equilibrium federal funds rate (Chart 8), a moderately restraining stance of policy that
might be viewed as appropriate given the worsening of the inflation outlook.  Such a
firming might also be seen as necessary to contain the risk that the near-term bulge in
inflation could become entrenched in expectations.  In that regard, members might be
heartened by the fact that the building market expectation of additional policy firming
in recent weeks was associated with some apparent decline in inflation expectations
progress that they might be loathe to surrender by surprising investors with an easier-
than-anticipated policy action.  The current configuration of asset prices, however,
might be judged as embedding too great a likelihood of policy tightening at the
August meeting.  If so, the Committee would presumably seek to craft its statement to
convey an assessment that an additional move in August was possible but perhaps not
as likely as currently anticipated in financial markets.
","Alternative B"
2006-08-08,14,"(14) Investors see about a one-third chance of a policy firming at this meeting
and appear to anticipate a statement similar to that under Alternative B.  As a result,
the market reaction to implementation of this alternative would likely be fairly small.
While short-term interest rates would decline somewhat, intermediate- and long-term
rates, stock prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would
change little.
","Alternative B"
2006-09-20,14,"(14) Judging from current financial quotes, market participants do not view
maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent for some time as an approach the
FOMC would select to balance competing macroeconomic risks.  Even though the
Committee identified upside risks as its predominant concern in the August
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 36
statement, money market futures prices suggest the anticipation of ½ percentage
point of policy easing next year, an expectation that imparts financial stimulus to the
extent that it has been incorporated in other asset values.  If that stimulus is seen as
excessive, the Committee could use the statement as a means to make plainer its
assessment that the policy rate is more likely to rise than to fall.  In particular, the
Committee could strike the reassuring phrase on balance about recent inflation
readings in row 2 of Alternative B and add an explicit characterization of the odds of
future action in row 4.  For example, after explaining that inflation risks remain, the
Committee could add that . . . policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward.
","Alternative B"
2006-12-12,14,"(14)  If the data released over the intermeeting period have caused members to
revise their assessment of the distribution of possible outcomes for inflation and
economic growth such that the risks are now thought to be more balanced, the
Committee may prefer the policy choice and wording of Alternative A.  The sharper
adjustment in residential investment implied by the incoming data, combined with the
continuing high level of inventories in the auto sector and the softer tone of recent
spending and production indicators more generally, might be seen as increasing the
downside risks to economic growth.  Members may also see some possibility that the
recent easing of financial conditions, and the associated stimulus to economic growth,
could be short lived, as illustrated in the Tighter financial conditions scenario
presented in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the staffs projection of relatively sluggish
near-term expansion might cause the Committee to worry that such downside risks, if
they materialized, could lead to a disproportionate slowdown in growth.  At the same
time, the Committees confidence that core inflation will decline may have been
boosted by the improvement in some measures of core inflation, the downward
revisions to data on increases in hourly compensation and unit labor costs earlier this
year, and the absence so far of substantial renewed upward pressure on oil prices.
The Committee may also place some weight on the possibility that inflation could
slow more quickly than in the staff forecast, either because the general persistence of
inflation may have declined over the past decade or because the recent pickup in core
inflation was associated importantly with increases in shelter costs, which might fall
back relatively sharply if the ongoing adjustment of the housing market leads to a
marked increase in the supply of rental accommodation.  Finally, as noted earlier,
maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent over the next few quarters would be

broadly consistent with the Committees past behavior as captured in the estimated
policy rules.
","Alternative A"
2007-01-30,14,"(14) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A
and B, the Committee would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting,
while under Alternative C it would tighten policy by 25 basis points.  Alternative A
would reflect a judgment that the risks to economic growth and inflation are now
roughly balanced.  In Alternatives B and C, the accompanying statement would
continue to indicate that inflation is the predominant risk, suggesting that additional
firming is still more likely than policy easing in the near term.  The rationale portion
of all three alternatives has been trimmed some, given that the references in the
December statement to prior monetary policy actions and the impetus to inflation
from rising energy prices seemed stale.
","Alternative C, Alternative A"
2007-05-09,14,"(14) The statement accompanying Alternative B could acknowledge that
economic growth slowed in the first part of the year, but indicate that the economy
still seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  The statement
would reiterate the risks to inflation posed by the high level of resource utilization and
conclude, as in March, that the Committees predominant policy concern remains the
risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.
","Alternative B"
1969-10-28,15,"(15) If the Committee should decide to move toward somewhat
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider directive
language along the following lines (alternative B):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations

easier conditions in the money market, concomitant with somewhat
stronger growth in the banking and deposit aggregates, it might con-

tending to decline somewhat for seasonal reasons.
","alternative a"
1970-12-15,15,"(15) Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides upon a 5 per cent target growth rate for the
money supply in the first quarter:

with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market con-
ditions consistent with those objectives.
Deletion of the phrase ""some easing of conditions in credit markets"" is
proposed in light of the analysis in paragraphs (10) and (11) above
suggesting that some rise in the Federal funds rate might be required as
the quarter progresses to keep the money supply growth rate from exceed-
ing 5 per cent. While some rise in the Federal funds rate would not
necessarily be inconsistent with continued declines in long-term rates,
particularly if over-all credit demands slacken, it is assumed that the
Committee would not want to indicate that it was seeking ""to promote""
some easing of credit market conditions under a policy course that
contemplates the possibility of some firming of money market conditions.

use if the Committee decides upon a 6 per cent target growth rate for the

anticipated in the second quarter. Thus, if the staff is correct in

pace of recent months. The growth rate in M2 is expected to moderate
further to a 9 per cent annual rate by the third quarter. On the other

1971-07-27,15,"(15) The deposit patterns described above for alternative A
imply a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate of increase in total reserves, seasonally
adjusted, from June to September, assuming excess reserves average about
$225 million. In August total reserves are expected to rise by about 13-1/2
per cent, reflecting in part the increase in required reserves
resulting from the expected expansion in U.S. Government demand deposits in
the latter half of July and early August and from the lagged effects of
the anticipated July money supply expansion. On the assumption that the
average level of borrowings is about unchanged from July and August, non-
borrowed reserves would grow at about the same rate as total reserves in
August; for the third quarter as a whole, however, nonborrowed would be
expected to grow at a slower rate of about 3 per cent in view of the
sharp drop in such reserves in July. Reserve growth would be somewhat
less under alternative B, particularly for nonborrowed reserves, with
part of the drop-off in nonborrowed offset by increased borrowing. The
following table shows monthly average levels of total and nonborrowed
reserves (in millions of dollars)--both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted

in two respects. First, the words ""over the months ahead"" are omitted
following the reference to growth in the aggregates. This modification
is proposed for consideration if the Committee does not wish to accept as
aggregate targets the comparatively low growth rates of alternative A for
a period longer than the weeks immediately ahead. Secondly, a clause
reading ""taking account of developments in capital markets"" is added at
the end of the first sentence. This change is suggested for consideration
if the Committee decides to instruct the Manager to give considerable
weight to the objective of avoiding excessive pressures in capital markets,
recognizing that this might require some adaptation in reserve supplying
operations. Either of these modifications might, of course, be made without
the other.

1971-11-16,15,"(15) With private demand deposits flat and outstanding U.S.
Government deposits declining on balance over the fourth quarter, the
bank credit proxy is expected to grow at only about a 3--4 per cent
annual rate over the period, followed by only a modest pick-up in the
first quarter. Banks may initially take a substantial share of the bills
offered in the forthcoming Treasury cash financings, but it is anticipated
that the banks will find it economical to sell them as U.S. Government
deposits are drawn down to finance the budgetary deficit. And more
generally, with bill rates below the Federal funds anddiscount rates,
banks have an incentive to reduce their generally ample liquid asset hold-
ings as loan demands develop. Under alternative C, bank credit expansion
would be somewhat more rapid in the last few weeks of the current quarter,
and considerably larger than under alternative A/B in the first quarter
of next year as growth in M2 accelerates.
","alternative C, alternative A"
1971-12-14,15,"(15) The Treasury bill market between now and the next meeting of
the Committee might have to absorb as much as $2-1/2 billion of new bills issued
for cash if the Treasury decides to cushion itself against the risk of
liquidation of special issues by foreign central banks. At the same time
foreign demands for bills, which recently have been very heavy, may be reduced
somewhat. While these developments would tend to raise bill rates, the
effect could be offset by the usual seasonal abatement of short-term market
pressures after mid-December and any expectational effects from today's
discount rate action. Thus, if day-to-day money market conditions are maintained
around those most recently prevailing, the 3-month bill rate may be in a 3-7/8--
and up under alternative A.
","alternative A"
1972-02-15,15,"(15) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides that the Desk should place primary emphasis on
bank reserves as the control variable, subject to a proviso constraining
the range of fluctuations in money market conditions. Under this alternative
money market conditions would, of course, be expected to fluctuate more
widely than under A, with the extent of fluctuation depending on the speci-
fic interpretation the Committee attached to the proviso clause.

The language of alternative B differs from that of alternative A
in that it includes a reference to developments in capital markets. It is
proposed for possible use in the event that members of the Committee wish to
provide some safeguard against the risk of a significant near-term rise in
interest rates, particularly long-term rates. The pattern of specifications
for this alternative could be the same as that for alternative A, but the phrase
""taking account of capital market developments"" could be construed as in-
structing the Manager to be more liberal in providing reserves and more
cautious in allowing the Federal funds rate to move upward if significant
increases in long-term interest rates appear to be in process.

to upward interest rate pressures from the demand side over the next few
months. The volume of corporate bonds coming to market appears to be
abating somewhat further, and mortgage credit demands seem to be topping
out. Market expectations appear to have shifted to an assumption of
relative rate stability over the next few months, but expectations could
change abruptly if money market conditions firm. Expectations might not
change to any significant degree under alternative A but would shift more
markedly if short-term market conditions move into the ranges associated

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed

to retain a reference to bank regulatory changes in light of continu-
ing uncertainties about the multiplier relationship as banks adapt to
the new regulations. Deletion of the reference to credit market develop-
ments is suggested because of the continuance of the more favorable
climate in security markets that had emerged at the time of the last
Committee meeting. Deletion of the reference to Treasury financing
operations is proposed since the only offerings in prospect between now
and the next meeting are the two already announced tax-anticipation bill
auctions, which would not ordinarily require even-keel consideration.
If the Treasury were to offer a long-term bond over the next few weeks,
it would most likely involve an auction and probably a small issue.

1973-02-13,15,"(15) A tightening of the money market, such as might accompany
alternative C, would probably lead to substantial upward adjustments in
both short- and long-term interest rates. Under these circumstances the
viability of the current discount rate and of CID efforts to defer
increases in the prime loan rate would come more clearly into question.
And there could be some acceleration of capital market borrowing, as
corporations attempted to safeguard themselves against higher rates later
or more stringent institutional borrowing conditions. Mortgage market
conditions would also tend to tighten as interest rates reached the zone
where a significant diversion of savings flows from banks and other
savings institutions became increasingly probable.
","alternative C"
1973-05-15,15,"(15) Alternative A indicates specifications that appear consis-
tent with a policy move toward a higher growth rate for the aggregates
than encompassed in alternative B. This alternative implies some easing
of money market conditions in the weeks ahead.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1973-06-18,15,"(15) Bank credit demands are expected to remain generally strong.
Should expectations of rising interest rates strengthen, though, some cor-
porate borrowers might shift out of banks into the capital market. In any
case, reduced inflows of both private demand and consumer-type time deposits
suggest that banks are likely to remain aggressive bidders for CD's. But
CD growth will probably be slower than in the first few months of the year
in reflection of the higher cost of CD's. On balance, taking all deposit
flows into account, growth in the bank credit proxy is expected to slow
further in the second half of the year under all three alternatives, with
the slowing greatest under alternative C.
Proposed directive
","alternative C"
1973-10-16,15,"(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to
retain the instruction to take account of international and domestic
financial market developments and to add a reference to the forthcoming
Treasury financing. Alternatives A and C refer to the average growth
rates in the monetary aggregates ""than has occurred thus far this
year."" The annual rates of growth from December 1972 to September 1973
are as follows: M1, 4.2 per cent; M2, 6.9 per cent; and the bank credit
proxy, 13.0 per cent.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING
TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic financial
market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate] FASTER growth in
monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED THUS

Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING

aggregates over the months ahead.

COMING TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

","alternative A, alternative B"
1974-03-18,15,"(15) In long-term credit markets, corporate and municipal bond
volume is likely to remain large over the next few months, based on the
current schedule of offerings. Foreign borrowing in the U.S. capital market
remains quite modest thus far, although it could pick up as borrowers become
more familiar with opportunities in the U.S. market. Some further upward
yield adjustments in bond markets might develop under current money market
conditions, while yield adjustments are likely to be considerable under
alternative B and very marked under alternative C. Further increases in
bond yields, as well as a rise of short-term interest rates, would also be
reflected in a tightening of mortgage market conditions.
Proposed directive language
","alternative B, alternative C"
1974-04-15,15,"(15) Under alternative B, with market interest rates little
changed on balance from current high levels, net savings inflows to
nonbank thrift institutions are likely to be slower than the 8 per cent
first-quarter pace. We would estimate a growth rate of about 6 per cent
in the second quarter and 4 per cent in the third, assuming no change in
Regulation Q. Under alternative C, these institutions would come under
greater pressure, of course, but in either case some tightening in the
availability of mortgage loan commitments would be likely, compared with
the situation in the early months of the year.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1974-06-18,15,"(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives dis-
cussed in the preceding section. As will be noted, alternative A
refers to growth rates in the monetary aggregates prevailing over
recent months. Growth in M1 was at an annual rate of about 7 per
cent in the first quarter, and including an estimate of 8.2 per
cent for June, it is about 7 per cent for the second quarter as well.
The comparable rates for M2 are about 10 per cent for the first
quarter and about 8 per cent for the second quarter.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]
ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that]
CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN the monetary aggregates AT ABOUT THE
RATES PREVAILING OVER RECENT MONTHS [DEL: appear to be growing at
rates within the specified ranges of tolerance].
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]
ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that
the] THAT WOULD MODERATE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates OVER THE
MONTHS AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the specified
ranges of tolerance].
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]
ACIIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that
the] THAT WOULD SLOW APPRECIABLY THE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates
OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the
specified ranges of tolerance].
","alternative A, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1974-07-16,15,"(15) The possibility of a credit crunch in financial markets
cannot be ignored, especially under alternative C. Such a development
could be triggered by a series of failures of financial or industrial
concerns, here or abroad. This could lead to sharply higher rates and a
drying up of credit flows in markets where there is perceived to be
heightened credit risk and to lower rates in safe markets, such as the
Treasury securities market. Many borrowers would not be able to obtain
credit, and some bank and other institutional lenders would not be able
to tap their usual sources of funds. Under the circumstances, remedial
action by the System would be expected, either through the market or
through the discount window. As a result, whatever specifications are
adopted by the Committee would very likely have to be superseded, at
least temporarily, by other operating criteria. It should be recognized
in any event that the various specifications presented are more uncertain
than usual since the situation in financial markets and the economy is
unprecedented in the postwar period.
Proposed directive language
","alternative C"
1974-09-10,15,"(15) It was assumed in the preceding discussion that if the
Committee adopts alternative B or A, it would want to have the money
market conditions expected to be consistent with the higher growth
rates for M1 established between now and the next meeting. However, the
Committee may wish to phase in any easing of market conditions over a
longer period, particularly under alternative A. Thus, the funds rate
could be permitted to decline in the inter-meeting period by less than
implied by the mid-points of the ranges shown in the summary table of
paragraph (6), in the expectation that some further decline would be
sought later. If staff estimates of relationships between interest
rates and monetary aggregates are correct, however, under such a pro-
cedure achievement of the indicated targets for the aggregates would
require a somewhat larger total decline in the funds rate than if the
move were accomplished quickly. For example, under alternative A, a
drop in the funds rate to 10¾ per cent over the next five weeks, followed
by a further decline to around 10 per cent by mid-November, could be

1974-10-14,15,"(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended

in the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed
to include a reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-
November refunding will be announced on October 30.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-02-19,15,"(15) Alternative C contemplates a smaller reduction in the
funds rate than alternative B and hence a less rapid growth in the
monetary aggregates between now and the end of summer. Under this
alternative, M1 is indicated to expand at an annual rate of about
year is over, M1 may have grown at near a 6 per cent rate under this
alternative if economic activity in the second half of the year turns
out to be as strong as projected in the Green Book.
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1975-03-18,15,"(15) Alternative C indicates growth paths for the monetary
aggregates intended to be consistent with some tightening of money market
conditions over the weeks ahead, A rise in the funds rate back above
initiate a sharp upward adjustment in yields on Treasury securities and
a turn-around, though perhaps less marked, in other market rates. Upward
rate pressures might be fairly severe for a time in corporate and municipal
bond markets, in view of the large volume of new issues currently over-
hanging the market and the possibility that investors would hold back
pending clarification of Federal Reserve intentions. With market interest
rates rising, the rate of growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits
at banks and thrift institutions would begin to diminish. And with the
change in prospects for savings inflows, mortgage market conditions would
not be likely to ease much, if any, further.
","Alternative C"
1975-04-14,15,"(15) The rise of interest rates under alternative B would work
to hold growth in M1 over the second and third quarters to around a 6¾ per
cent annual rate, as noted earlier. With some diminution in the expansion
of interest-bearing deposits, growth in broader measures of money would
be moderated, relative to alternative A. Bank credit expansion would be
reduced somewhat, but with business and consumer loan demands expected
to be weak at least over the next month or two, banks would still be in
a position to participate heavily in Treasury financings.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1975-06-16,15,"(15) A significant rise in the Federal funds rate--for example,
to the 6 per cent mid-point of the alternative B range--would, however,
alter market expectations and lead to upward adjustments in interest
rates. The adjustments would probably be most marked in short-term
rates, with the 3-month bill rate rising to perhaps 5¾-6 per cent by
mid-July. Adjustments in longer-term rates might be moderated by market
expectations of a continued slowing in the rate of inflation, a gradual
reduction in the prospective volume of new offerings, and by the
relatively substantial upward slope to the yield curve that now exists.
","alternative B"
1975-07-15,15,"(15) Alternative A involves an easing of money market conditions
over the near-term, which in effect reverses the recent tightening.
Market interest rates would tend to decline in sympathy, but declines
might be quite modest as many market participants may assume that the
easing in money market conditions will be transitory, given the consensus
forecast of a strengthening in economic activity. Indeed, the staff
believes that under this alternative, short-term rates would have to
begin rising again by late summer or early fall to achieve longer-term
objectives for the monetary aggregates.
","Alternative A"
1975-08-19,15,"(15) In the August-September period, we would expect savings
inflows to continue at the more moderate recent pace, but perhaps to
be drifting lower, particularly under alternative C. The bank credit
proxy is expected to remain quite weak, since banks are unlikely
to become aggressive in seeking funds through issuance of CD's
and non-deposit liabilities until business loan demand strengthens
","alternative C"
1975-10-21,15,"(15) The staff expects that interest rate declines under
alternative A would facilitate attainment of higher longer-run growth rates
for the monetary aggregates--typified by M1 growth over the next year in a
in interest rates are likely to be quite substantial, however, especially
when considered in conjunction with expansion over the longer-run of
transactions demands. Thus, the Federal funds rate under this alternative
probably would have to begin rising again late in the year to keep money
growth around the mid-point of the higher range.
","alternative A"
1976-01-20,15,"(15) A Federal funds rate centered around 4¾ per cent is con-
templated under alternative B, with M1 growth in a 4-8 per cent annual
rate range in the January-February period. Given such a funds rate,
interest rates generally may show little net change over the next few
weeks. If anything, short-term interest rates could drift up a little, as
expectations by some market participants of a further decline in the funds
rate, following the discount rate action announced today, are disappointed.
Longer-term market interest rates may remain around the recent reduced
levels, given the more moderate corporate bond calendar and the availability
of sizable funds for investment in longer-term markets from insurance
companies, savings banks, and pension funds. With business loan demand
slack, banks may show increased interest in intermediate-term Treasury
offerings to increase earnings, particularly in view of the steep slope
of the yield curve. Mortgage rates can be expected to decline somewhat
further since savings inflows to thrift institutions are expected to be
well maintained and since a more favorable yield spread of primary mortgage
rates over corporate bond rates has recently developed.
","alternative B"
1976-04-20,15,"(15) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in terms
of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and are intended
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the
preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed in the event that the
Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of money market con-
ditions and wishes to maintain the conditions now prevailing. Since the
last meeting, exchange market conditions have tended to become stable,
although the pound and the lira remain subject to particular uncer-
tainties. Therefore, in all alternatives, we propose deleting the
specific reference to ""the sensitive state of foreign exchange markets""
that was inserted at the last meeting, and restoring the previously long-
standing reference to international financial markets.
Alternative ""Monetary Aggregates"" Proposals
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL: and the sensitive

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL; and the sensitve

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1976-05-18,15,"(15) The staff's longer-run projections of the Federal funds
rate under each of the three alternatives are shown in appendix table IV.
As may be seen, the staff expects that under alternative B the funds rate
would peak out at around 8-1/2 per cent early next year. However, under
alternative C, which contemplates a prompt further move toward restraint,
the funds rate may peak out at a lower 7-3/4 per cent level by the winter
of this year. A considerably higher ultimate level for the funds rate is
envisaged under alternative A, since it would be necessary to offset later
the effects of near-term easing in reserve conditions contemplated by that
alternative. In view of these interest rate expectations, we have assumed
for all alternatives an increase in Regulation Q ceiling rates in the fall
of this year of 50 basis points for certificates maturing in 4 years or
more and 25 basis points for shorter-term certificates. Even so, as
indicated in the last two lines of the table on p. 6a, over the QI '76-QI '77
period, growth in M1 at a rate equal to the mid-point of the FOMC's range
is expected to be associated with growth in M2 and M3 at rates near the
bottom of their respective ranges.
Proposed directive
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1976-07-19,15,"(15) Alternative A contemplates more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates over QII '76-QII '77--including a 6-3/4 per cent growth rate for
M1 --and some near-term easing of money market conditions, with the funds
rate range centering on 4-3/4 per cent. With economic expansion continu-
ing, however, it would be expected that interest rates would have to begin
rising in early fall, with the funds rate reaching 5-3/4 per cent by early
interest-bearing deposits would probably accelerate for a time and M2 and
M3 would remain quite strong into early winter--before slowing as rates on
market securities become more attractive.
","Alternative A"
1976-08-17,15,"(15) Alternative A assumes an easing of money market conditions
between now and the next meeting--with the funds rate dropping to the mid-
point of a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 per cent range. Given the outlook for GNP, such
a near-term easing would probably need to be reversed shortly in order to
attain a 5-3/4 per cent growth in M1 from QII '76 to QII '77. If the
reversal were begun in early fall, the funds rate might peak out at around
under alternative B. An upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates
might be required somewhat earlier than under B, perhaps in the winter of
next year.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1976-10-19,15,"(15) Further increases in interest rates can be expected over
the longer-run under alternative C, assuming M1 growth over the QIII '76-
QIII '77 period is constrained to around 4-3/4 per cent. As shown in the
appendix table, a funds rate as high as 7-3/4 per cent might develop by
the fall of 1977.
","alternative C"
1976-12-20,15,"(15) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on
bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would
depend on the specific conditions sought. Three alternative ""money
market"" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered
policy alternatives are given below.
Alternative ""Money Market"" Proposals
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market
conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates]
over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES
APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market
conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates]
over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES
APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market
conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates]
over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES
APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1977-01-17,15,"(15) Alternative C involves a tightening of the Federal funds
rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 4 ¾-5½ per cent range.
Over the January-February period M1 growth may be in a 3-7 per cent
range--a step toward attaining the lower longer-run ranges for the
monetary aggregates proposed for this alternative. The staff would
expect that further pressures would have to be applied to the money
market as the year progresses if growth in M1 over the QIV '76-QIV '77
period is to be constrained to around the mid-point of the 3½-5½ per
cent alternative C range. The funds rate might reach about 7¼ per cent
by the fourth quarter.
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1977-02-15,15,"(15) The near-term easing of the money market encompassed by
alternative A would, of course, lead to declines in interest rates over
the next few weeks and higher growth rates in the monetary aggregates.
Most market participants would probably view the drop in the funds rate
as temporary, and this would work to limit interest rate declines. In
bond markets, for example, corporations would be likely to accelerate
offerings of new issues.
","alternative A"
1977-04-19,15,"(15) Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market
conditions between now and the next Committee meeting, with the funds
rate dropping to the mid-point of a 3¾-4¾ per cent range. Such a move
would be accompanied by somewhat greater growth in the monetary
aggregates than under alternative B over the April-May period. In
particular, there may be substantial inflows into savings deposits as
short-term market rates drop significantly further below ceiling rates
on such deposits. This would, of course, increase pressure on institutions
to shave their offering rates.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1977-05-17,15,"(15) The near-term easing of the money market under
alternative A would probably stimulate a substantial rally in debt
markets, particularly in light of the sizable short position of U.S.
Government security dealers in coupon issues. The staff would not
expect any decline in the funds rate to be sustainable, given the
strong growth in nominal GNP that is projected. A subsequent rather
sharp rise in the funds rate would seem to be required under the cir-
cumstances to keep monetary growth rates within their longer-run ranges.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1977-06-21,15,"(15) An easing of the Federal funds rate over the near term
to the mid-point of a 4½ to 5¼ per cent range--as called for under
alternative A--and the associated decline in short-term rates might
well be accompanied, at least temporarily, by significant declines in
long-term rates. At present dealer positions in Treasury coupon issues
are relatively low and forward calendars for long-term Treasury and
corporate debt are quite light. In order to achieve growth rates in M-1
at the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range, however, the Federal
funds rate would have to begin to rise relatively soon and to reach a
level above those envisioned under alternatives B and C. Thus, under
alternative A, the Federal funds rate would be expected to average around
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative A"
1977-07-19,15,"(15) With the funds rate rising over the next few weeks as
specified above, we would expect M-1 in the July-August period to expand
in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and M-2 in a 6½-10½ per cent range.
Net inflows of shorter-term small denomination time deposits
to banks and thrift institutions may slow at the higher interest
levels, and there may also be a further outflow of interest-sensitive
savings deposits of individuals, businesses, and State and local governments.
Banks may be expected to adapt to such developments by more aggressively
offering large denomination time deposits; except for negotiable deposits
offered by large banks, these deposits are included in M-2. Even under the
short-run specifications of alternative C, there would appear to be sufficient
leeway between ceiling rates in time certificates maturing in four years
or more and yields on market instruments to enable banks to retain the
funds involved in maturing ""wild card"" certificates. They could, however,
lose some funds to thrift institutions, which can offer somewhat higher
","alternative C"
1977-08-16,15,"(15) Alternative C involves a rise in the Federal funds
rate to the mid-point of a 6¼-6¾ per cent range between now and the
next Committee meeting. Such an approach would add to restraint on
money growth in the weeks ahead--with M-1 expected to expand in a
only a very minor further rise in the funds rate might be required in
achieving the Committee's current longer-run ranges for the monetary
","Alternative C"
1977-10-17,15,"(15) A tightening of the funds market to the mid-point of a
alternatives C or D--alternatives that over the longer-run involve lower
growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative B. Such a
rise in the funds rate in the weeks immediately ahead would probably be
associated with a 2½-7½ per cent annual rate range for M-1 and a
","alternative B"
1978-01-17,15,"(15) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2
per cent range. Under this alternative M-1 and M-2 growth over the
January-February period may be in 2 to 8 and 4½ to 8½ per cent ranges,
respectively. If the Committee followed this course, the 3-month bill
rate would likely increase to about 7 per cent between now and the next
meeting, with commensurate adjustments in other short rates. Member
bank borrowing would begin to rise, and pressures for a discount rate
increase would develop. The increase in short-term interest rates under
the alternative would tend to strengthen the dollar on international
exchange markets.
","Alternative C"
1978-03-21,15,"(15) The sizable increase in short-term rates likely to
develop under alternative C would probably be accompanied by only
modest upward pressure on bond yields in the intermeeting period.
As previously noted, new bond offerings are expected to be modest
and institutional investment demand strong. By contributing to
slower deposit inflows, however, alternative C would add to near-term
upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an
adjustment in deposit ceiling rates.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1978-05-16,15,"(16) Under either alternative A or B, growth over the
quarters ahead of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings
will slow more than projected last month. Not only are market
interest rates now expected to be higher, but the upward adjustment
in deposit rate ceilings announced by the regulatory agencies is less
than the staff had previously projected.1 Consequently, the staff
believes that a further increase in deposit rate ceilings on longer-
term certificates will be needed to maintain flows of small-denomination
time deposits, and has assumed such an increase in the fourth quarter.
Even with an increase in ceiling rates, growth in M-3 over the longer-
run policy period may be around the lower end of its 7½ to 10 per cent
range. While growth in small-denomination time and savings deposits
at banks will also remain weak, M-2 expansion is expected to be near
the mid-point of the Committee's longer-run range, reflecting sizable
issuance of time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings.
The slower growth of deposits subject to rate ceilings, and the
resultant increased reliance on managed liabilities and draw-downs
of portfolio liquidity by both banks and thrift institutions, will
be associated with mounting strains on their balance sheet positions.
As the year progresses, therefore, the ability and willingness of
these institutions to meet credit demands can be expected to decline
Directive language
","alternative A"
1978-07-18,15,"(15) Expansion in M-2 under alternative B is likely to be
in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range over the July-August period.
Growth at the mid-point of this range would maintain M-2 in the
upper half of its longer-run range, as shown in Chart 2.
","alternative B"
1978-08-15,15,"(15) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for
the directive. The language of alternative A is consistent with the
specifications of alternative A discussed in the preceding section. Like
the directive adopted at the last meeting, it places main emphasis on
money market conditions and calls for operations directed at maintain-
ing the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 7-3/4 to
","alternative A, alternative A"
1978-09-19,15,"(15) The modest increase in the funds rate contemplated
under alternative B is, of course, likely to have some upward impact
on short-term market rates of interest. However, such rates may rise
by less than the funds rate--and long-term rates by quite small amounts--
if market participants act on the assumption that the peak in interest
rates is even closer at hand. A further increase in the funds rate
would reinforce market expectations of another adjustment in the dis-
count rate. Barring such an adjustment, member bank borrowing would
be likely to increase noticeably.
","alternative B"
1979-02-06,15,"(15) Three alternative short-run specifications for the
monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate are presented below
for Committee consideration. Alternative I calls for a reduction
in the Federal funds rate by ½ percentage point from the current
level; such a decline over the intermeeting period would be most
consistent with the alternative A longer-run range. Alternative II
calls for no change in the current 9¾ to 10½ per cent funds rate range,
with a midpoint near the present Desk objective. This alternative
would be consistent with both the alternative B and C longer-run
ranges. Alternative III, which calls for increases in the funds
rate to around the midpoint of a 10¼ to 11 per cent range, is most
consistent with longer-run alternative C. (More detailed and
longer-run data are shown in tables on pages 12 and 13).

(Intermeeting period) 9¼ to 10 9¾ to 10½ 10¼ to 11
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1979-04-17,15,"(15) Alternative A calls for a decline in the funds rate over
the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9¼ to 10 per cent range.
Growth in M-1 and M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 3 to 7
and 5 to 9 per cent, respectively. An easing action might tend to reinforce
views that a considerable weakening in economic activity is in prospect.
As a result, short-term interest rates could decline sharply. Bond yields
would be expected to decline in the short-run, as investors might feel that
interest rates had peaked. However, such strength could be short-lived
because many market participants would question the System's resolve to
restrain inflationary pressures. Reflecting this latter concern, the
dollar probably would lose strength in exchange markets.
","Alternative A"
1979-05-22,15,"(15) Under alternative B, market interest rates are expected
to show little net change,although markets remain highly sensitive to
incoming information on prices, economic activity, energy, and the money
supply. Short-term credit demands from business may remain fairly strong
over the next few weeks but--with the exception of a very short-term cash
management bill offering in early June--the Treasury is not expected to raise
any new cash in the bill market over the balance of the quarter. In the
long-term area, offerings of corporate and State and local government
bonds are expected to be moderate for the rest of the quarter. The Treasury
will likely be out of the longer-term market over the balance of the
quarter, meeting its needs in coupon markets with comparatively small
additions to the regular 2-year note cycle offerings. In the mortgage market,
however, yields can be expected to continue rising as available supplies
of credit are constrained by the reduced deposit flows to thrift institutions.
","alternative B"
1979-08-14,15,"(15) Alternative C calls for an increase in the Federal funds
rate to the midpoint of a 10-3/4 to 11-1/2 percent range. Over the August-
September period, M-1 probably would grow in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent
annual rate range and M-2 between 7-1/2 and 11-1/2 percent. A further
tightening action at this juncture would reinforce the view that the
Federal Reserve is giving relatively heavy weight to domestic inflation
and the performance of the dollar abroad in formulating its policies.
The dollar likely would strengthen on foreign exchange markets, and while a
rise in short-term rates could be anticipated, bond yields might increase
rather little, if at all. Given the already wide spread between bond
yields and mortgage rates--and the minor impact of the assumed short-term
rate increase on thrift institution deposit flows--mortgage rates probably
might increase only moderately.
","Alternative C"
1979-09-18,15,"(15) Alternative A calls for a decline in the Federal funds rate
to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 percent range, and would be associated with
ranges for M-1 and M-2 of 5 to 9 and 8 to 12 percent, respectively. In
the current environment, an easing in policy would take the market by surprise,
and the initial reaction to such a development would likely be a rather
sharp drop in both short- and long-term interest rates, particularly if
market participants were to interpret the easing as the cyclical turning
point in interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would
very probably come under strong downward pressure. The rally in bond markets
might be constrained by a buildup of the corporate bond calendar, as firms
accelerated offerings, and by continuing investor concern about the outlook
for inflation. The anticipated decline in interest rates under alternative A
is likely to be associated with only a slight easing of mortgage markets,
especially since short-term interest rates would not be expected to decline
sufficiently to restore the differential on MMC's favoring thrift institutions.
","Alternative A, alternative A"
1980-03-18,15,"(15) Alternative C would probably require growth in the monetary
base over the February to June period at about a 7 percent annual rate,
while total reserves would expand at a 5 percent rate. Nonborrowed
reserves may expand at about a ½ percent annual rate, assuming an initial
level of borrowing of around $2¾ billion and a gradual decline beginning
around mid-spring.
","Alternative C"
1980-04-22,15,"(15) Alternative C calls for one-half percentage point less growth
in M-1A and M-1B, at an annual rate, over the December to June period relative
to alternative B. This would imply growth in M-1A over the two months of
May and June of about 7¾ percent, or more than 1½ percentage points less
than alternative B. The funds rate would probably be in the area of 18
percent in the weeks ahead, or perhaps a little lower. Shorter-term market
rates are likely to back up a bit under this alternative, as market
participants become more doubtful about the timing and amplitude of a
cyclical downturn in rates. However, any tendency for longer-term market
rates to rebound from their recent lower levels might be limited if the
relatively tight monetary policy stance is construed as increasing the odds
of controlling inflation and/or intensifying the recession. The dollar
probably would not weaken further on foreign exchange markets and might
strengthen a bit.
","Alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1980-05-20,15,"(15) To achieve the growth in aggregates for the May-June period
specified under alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about
a 4 percent annual rate from April to June. Nonborrowed reserves would
expand at about a 27 percent annual rate, assuming a frictional level of
adjustment borrowing from Reserve Banks on the order of $100 to $200 million
(and continued special borrowing of about $750 million).
","alternative A"
1980-08-12,15,"(15) A simple extrapolation of the June to September target
for M-1A under alternative A would yield a 4 percent growth of this
aggregate for the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period. Alternative B could be
viewed as consistent with M-1A growth over the longer period of 3 percent--
the lower bound of the Committee's long-run range. In either case, interest
rates at year-end would be expected by the staff to be significantly higher
than current levels, given our GNP projection. Even with such an increase
in rates, M-2 growth for the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period is likely to be
near or above the upper end of its 6 to 9 percent long-run growth range.
Directive language
","alternative A, Alternative B"
1980-09-16,15,"(15) The specifications for alternative B would require
total reserve growth from August to October at a little more than a 6
percent annual rate. Assuming adjustment borrowings of about $800 million,
nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 1/2 percent annual rate. Given
this reserve path, the funds rate would probably be 11 percent or a little
higher, and other short-term rates might edge up from current levels.
Mortgage rates would probably rise noticeably further, as thrift institutions
become increasingly concerned about the cost and availability of deposits.
The dollar might take on a stronger tone in foreign exchange markets.
Directive language
","alternative B"
1980-11-18,15,"(15) Alternative C contemplates a reduction in the Committee's
current fourth quarter money growth target, and implies a substantial
reduction in money growth over the balance of the year that brings the level
of M-1B into the FOMC's target zone by December. To achieve the alternative
C specifications would probably require a reduction in nonborrowed reserves
at about a 5 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year, if
a borrowing level of $2 billion, or a bit higher, is assumed. The funds
rate may move up to around the 16 to 17 percent area over the next few
weeks, and possibly higher by year-end. This alternative increases the risk
of a more significant drop-off in money growth and economic activity in
early 1981, and consequently increases the likelihood that interest rates
will be lower in the first quarter of the year than under the other two
alternatives. However, the staff would anticipate that, even under this
alternative, interest rates over the next year would still have to be high
by historical standards to constrain money growth to the Committee's
preliminary targets.
Directive language
","Alternative C, alternative
C"
1980-12-18,15,"(15) Alternative B has been designed to place M-1A and M-1B
in March near the midpoints of the FOMC's tentative long-range targets for
over the first three months of next year would be 4¼ percent annual rate,
assuming M-1A grows at the 2½ percent annual rate for December. Substantially
lower growth rates are included in alternative C. This alternative would tend
to limit the potential for interest rate declines should the economy weaken
as projected and may tend to reduce the risk of pronounced interest
rate fluctuations in the course of the year. Alternative A proposes some-
what higher growth rates of money than alternative B. (The charts on the
following pages depict the near-term behavior of the monetary targets under the
three alternatives, with M-1A and M-1B shown both before and after adjust-
ment for the impact of NOW accounts; the alternatives are shown in relation
to the tentative long-run ranges for 1981 established at the July meeting.)
","Alternative B, alternative C, Alternative A, alternative B"
1981-03-31,15,"(15) From the perspective of the year as a whole, the degree of
rate pressure we would foresee over the next several months under alternative
C, which is consistent with a strategy of lowering M-1B growth for the year
to the bottom of its range, would be likely to weaken the outlook for GNP
relative to the current staff forecast (which is based on alternative B).
As a result, this alternative carries with it a potential for a drop-off of
interest rates from peak levels later in the year, in response to a pro-
nounced cyclical weakening of the economy. By year-end interest rates
under alternative C thus could be lower than under alternative B.
","alternative
C, alternative B, alternative c, alternative C, alternative B"
1981-10-05,15,"(16) Under alternative A, M1-B growth is targeted to rise at
about a 12 percent annual rate from September to December in order to
bring this aggregate back to the lower bound of its long-run range by the
end of the year. We would expect a substantial drop in short-term rates--
with the funds rate dropping into a 10 to 12 percent range on average and
to reach this objective. Total reserves would have to rise at a 9 percent
annual rate over the quarter, and nonborrowed reserves at about an 18
percent annual rate. A reserve operating path that appears to entail market
rates well below the present 14 percent discount rate calls into question
the sustainability of that rate, for technical reasons if for no other.1/
","alternative A"
1981-11-17,15,"(15) The possibility of the funds rate dropping significantly
below the current 13 percent discount rate introduces complications in the
design of reserve paths, particularly for alternatives A and B. The
complications arise if reserve paths do not involve sufficient levels
of borrowing at the discount window to permit weakness in demands for
money (and for required reserves) to be cushioned by commensurate declines
in borrowings. The funds rate could then be subject to sharp downward
pressures as the reserves provided led to sizable excess reserves. An
initial borrowing level around the $400 million expected in the current
statement week would provide some borrowing cushion. Frictional levels
of borrowing that would provide virtually no cushion appear to be in the
$50 to $150 million range. The nonborrowed reserve path for alternative C,
the alternative involving the least expansion in reserves, might be initially
constructed on the basis of $400 million in borrowing. The more
reserve expansion of alternatives A and B logically should be based
on lower levels of borrowing, but whether set at frictional levels or
higher, we would expect the demand for reserves soon to fall well short
of supply. In such cases, to avoid an undue build-up in excess reserves,
adjustments in the nonborrowed reserve path might need to be considered
in conjunction with discount rate strategy.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1982-03-29,15,"(15) In considering the proposed alternatives for the second
quarter, the Committee may also want to take account of implications for
the second half of the year. If the M1 specification of alternative A is
adopted for the second quarter, this would imply a further deceleration
of M1 growth over the last six months of the year to a 2¾ percent annual
rate to be consistent with growth for the year (QIV to QIV basis) at
the year (see the top line of the ""4¾"" column in the table below.)
The last column of the table shows that growth at about a 4 percent
annual rate over the last six months of the year would be consistent with
hitting the upper limit of the longer-run range under alternative A--which
would provide more scope for financing expected economic recovery. If
the Committee were to adopt the second-quarter targets of alternatives
B or C, some acceleration in growth over the 6-month June-to-December
period--to just above a 4 percent annual rate under alternative C--would
be in prospect even if growth for the year were constrained to 4¾ percent.
Should the Committee accept growth in M1 for the year at the upper limit
of its longer-run range, even more rapid growth in the second half would
be in prospect (5 to 6 percent, depending on whether alternative B or C
is adopted at this meeting).

1982-05-18,15,"(15) The staff is projecting an appreciable expansion in GNP in
the second half of the year under the impetus of the mid-year tax cut and
an end to the current inventory liquidation. Underlying this projection
is the assumption that a marked acceleration of the growth of nominal GNP
to about a 9¼ percent annual rate can be financed by relatively modest
growth of narrow money--keeping Ml growth within the upper portion of its
longer-run range--without upward interest rate pressures in the second half.
Under alternative B, for example, growth in M1 in the second half of the
year of 3 to 4¾ percent, as shown in the table below, would be consistent
with growth for the year at the upper limit or just below. The implied
velocity expansion, with no rise of interest rates, depends not only
on increased willingness to draw on previously accumulated liquidity to
finance spending but also on a downward impact on money demand from the
continued spread of financial innovations, such as sweep accounts.
Alternative A would provide less room for growth of M1 in the second
half of the year, assuming the present longer-run target range is retained.
Alternative C, of course, provides the most scope for monetary expansion
in the second half, but has a slightly greater risk of delaying the onset
of economic recovery.

1982-08-24,15,"(15) The firming of the funds rate from very recent levels
contemplated in this alternative would seem to run counter to the expec-
tations of a good many market participants. As a result, it is quite
likely that short-term rates would back up, with the 3-month bill rate
moving back toward 9 percent. Bond yields would retrace some of their
recent declines, though any reaction in credit markets could be mild in
the context of M1 remaining below the 5-1/2 percent upper bound of the
Committee's 1982 target range (which is assumed in the path) and if incoming
economic data continue weak. Because money market fund yields would more
quickly come into alignment with market rates, M2 and especially M3 growth
would probably be a bit slower than under alternative A. The very recent
downward pressures on the dollar in exchange markets probably would abate,
and may be reversed.
","alternative A"
1982-10-05,15,"(15) Alternative C calls for virtually no further growth in M1
from September to December, which would achieve the upper limit of the
FOMC's annual target for that aggregate. Total reserves would be expected
to expand at a 2 percent rate over the fourth quarter. Such reserve and
money growth would probably involve a federal funds rate moving rather
promptly into the 11 to 11-1/2 percent area. Assuming no change in the
discount rate, borrowing would likely be around $1 billion and nonborrowed
reserves would show little net change.
","Alternative C"
1982-11-16,15,"(15) The further easing in bank reserve positions contemplated
by alternative A might involve a drop in the 3-month bill rate to around
policy adjustments. As markets ease, and confidence in markets and the
economy improves, some little further narrowing in quality spreads might
develop. The bank prime rate would probably decline to around 11 percent.
Bond rates would also likely share in these downward adjustments, as
investors hastened to lock up still relatively high longer-term yields.
And the lower cost of thrift institution deposits would bring additional
downward pressure on mortgage rates. The further decline in U.S. interest
rates would tend at least to blunt the strength of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets, and may well bring some depreciation.
","alternative A"
1982-12-20,15,"(15) Alternative A calls for a more rapid expansion in aggregates
during the first quarter of the year. It would accommodate a rise in M2
at about a 12 percent annual rate (including assumed shifts). Such an
approach may make it a bit more difficult than under alternative B to
keep M2 growth over the year as a whole within its longer-run target range.
Since alternative A would probably be associated with a drop in short-term
rates over the near-term--typified by federal funds falling to around
that a fairly substantial reversal of interest rates as the year 1983
progresses may be required under this alternative to restrain M2 growth
to its longer-term range (assuming that economic activity improved in the
course of the year).
","Alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1983-05-24,15,"(15) Under alternative B, there is little reason to believe
that interest rates in general would change much from current levels, given
the recent back-up in interest rates. The 3-month Treasury bill rate
would probably trade in the vicinity of 8¼ percent. The bond market is
likely to remain able to absorb a large supply of corporate, tax exempt,
and Treasury offerings at around present rate levels, although those rates
could come under upward pressure should signs of more vigorous economic
recovery emerge, particularly if doubts intensified about prospects for
fiscal restraint. After edging down recently mortgage rates may tend to
stabilize. The total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
increase at about a 9 to 9½ percent annual rate over the second quarter--
little different from the first--as federal government credit demands
remain large and private credit demands stay moderate.
","alternative B"
1983-08-23,15,"(15) Alternative A contemplates some easing in money market
conditions, with federal funds in an 8-1/2 to 9 per cent area and borrow-
ing declining to the $400-$600 million range. Nonborrowed reserves would
be expected to expand at about a 6 per cent annual rate from July to
September. Market interest rates would probably decline substantially
in response to the unexpected easing of money markets, with the 3-month
Treasury bill rate falling to the 8-1/2 per cent area. A considerable
rally probably would develop in bond markets. With bond rates falling,
business issuance of long-term obligations would burgeon once again,
while borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market receded.
In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would tend to weaken, probably
falling below levels prevailing around the time of the July FOMC meeting.

growth of the monetary aggregates for the November-to-March period, the
interval used by the Committee in setting monetary growth rates at its
December meeting; more detailed data are shown on the table and charts on

intermeeting period and implied growth rates for the aggregates from
January to March are presented in the lower panels of the table. The speci-
fications of alternative B retain the growth rate for the broad aggregates
chosen by the Committee at its last meeting; however, they also include a
somewhat higher growth for M1 in light of recent experience with the relation-
ship between the narrow and broader aggregates. Alternative A calls for more
rapid money growth, and alternative C involves slower growth, with M1 growing
at the rate specified at the previous meeting.

","alternative B, Alternative A, alternative C"
1984-03-26,15,"(15) Borrowing at the discount window under alternative A
would be around $550 to $650 million, and nonborrowed reserves would
increase at about a 10 percent annual rate. The federal funds rate
would probably drop to around 9-3/4 percent. Other interest rates
also would be expected to decline from current levels, at least to the
degree that some of the recent rate increases may have anticipated
firmer monetary conditions than contemplated under this alternative.
The extent of any such rally could be quite limited, however, in the
absence of substantive progress in reducing the budget deficit and
evidence of a slowing in the pace of economic activity. Moreover, a
tendency for growth in the monetary aggregates to be relatively strong,
as is anticipated in this alternative, particularly for M1 and M3, would
probably lead to market expectations that any moderation in the degree
of pressure on bank reserve positions was not sustainable.
","alternative A"
1984-05-21,15,"(15) Alternative C involves restraining growth of M1 and M2 to
rates below current FOMC short-run objectives and sets in train forces
that would work to bring M3 and credit growth back toward their longer-
run ranges. Discount window borrowing might rise toward $1-1/2 billion
under alternative C, which probably would be associated with federal
funds trading consistently somewhat above 11 percent. Nonborrowed
reserves would be expected to contract slightly on average in May and
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1984-08-21,15,"(15) Alternative C calls for sane tightening in money market
conditions over the period ahead, should it be desired to place even more
constraint on the growth of credit. Borrowing at the discount window
would be expected to increase to $1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion and nonborrowed
reserves to decline at around a 6 percent annual rate. The federal
funds rate would probably rise to the 12-1/4 to 12-1/2 percent area, and
other market interest rates also would adjust upward, with Treasury bill
rates climbing into the 10-1/2 to 11 percent range, and CD rates perhaps
rising even more rapidly to around 12 to 12-1/2 percent as strains on the
financial system increased. The associated increases in the prime rate,
bond yields, and mortgage rates would probably soon restrain credit
growth and spending relative to the staff's current projection. The
dollar would tend to appreciate further on exchange markets, at least
","Alternative C"
1984-10-02,15,"(16) Alternative C, which involves some tightening of money
market conditions over the intermeeting period, would be expected to
restrain M1 growth over the balance of the year to a rate below the
midpoint of its long-run range and to exert particular restraint on
credit growth. Borrowing at the discount window under this alternative
would return to around the $1 billion level prevailing over most of the
spring and summer, with nonborrowed reserves declining by around 4 per-
cent over October and November. The federal funds rate would be expected
to return to the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent area, or possibly a bit higher.
The Treasury bill rate would rise to around 10-3/4 percent, CD rates
would increase by 1/2 percentage point or perhaps more, and the dollar
would probably rise, at least for a while, on foreign exchange markets.
With upward pressures reemerging in short-term markets, longer-term
yields can be expected to retrace some of the declines since early summer,
leading to further reductions in demands for mortgage credit as well as
to shifts in borrowing by businesses back toward short-term markets--and
also possibly to reconsideration of over-all borrowing and spending
Directive language
","Alternative C"
1984-11-07,15,"(15) The behavior of monetary aggregates and aggregate re-
serves under alternative A is expected to be consistent with borrowing
at the discount window of around $400 million, near the currently esti-
mated ""frictional"" level. The federal funds rate would decline to close
to the 9 percent discount rate, probably just above it. Other interest
rates, both short- and long-term, would decline sharply, with the 3-month
Treasury bill rate falling to the 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent area; the dollar
would probably decline substantially further on exchange markets. Expecta-
tions of a discount rate cut would become widespread. In credit markets,
bond issuance would be enlarged, and mortgage commitments and borrowing
could begin to pick up in late fall and winter in response to the lower
rates and the greater willingness of thrifts to supply credit aggressively
as their financial condition improved. The decline in rates in November
and December would tend to boost money demand in 1985 both through its
direct effect on opportunity costs and indirectly by fostering somewhat
faster growth of income and credit demands than currently projected.
This would increase the odds of some backup in rates in the first part of
next year in the process of restraining money growth to around the mid-
points of the Committee's tentative long-run ranges for 1985.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1984-12-17,15,"(15) The money supply specifications of alternative A are
expected to entail an increase in total reserves of about 15 percent at
an annual rate from November to March, accompanied by a drop in the funds
rate to 8 percent or a little below. Absent a decline in the discount
rate, discount window borrowing is likely to be at a bare minimum, and
excess reserves perhaps somewhat higher than usual, with nonborrowed
reserves rising at about a 21 percent annual rate through March. If
the discount rate were reduced from the present 8-1/2 percent level,
reserve growth consistent with this alternative could be accomplished
with somewhat less expansion in nonborrowed reserves than otherwise.
Under this alternative, the 3-month Treasury bill rate may drop to around

1985-03-26,15,"(15) M1 growth would slow relatively little from the December-
to-March pace under this alternative and would move above the upper limit
of the band. M2 and M3 growth rates are expected to be relatively moder-
ate, though M2 is expected to remain above the long-run cone in June
under this approach. Moreover, there is potential for quite rapid growth
for a while in the broad aggregates, particularly if market rates were to
decline abruptly in face of lagging institutional rates.
","alternative a"
1985-05-21,15,"(15) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with
alternatives, is shown below with suggested deletions from the current
directive indicated in strike-through form and proposed additions in
caps. As in the past, it is assumed that the ""degree of pressure
on reserve positions"" is indexed primarily by the level of borrowing at
the discount window, excluding borrowing classified as extended credit.
In the proposed directive it is also assumed that the ""degree of pressure
on reserve positions"" excludes any special situation borrowing at thrifts
that has not yet been classified as extended credit. On that basis,
alternative B is suggested as consistent with maintaining the existing
degree of pressure on reserve positions, although the associated funds
rate is likely to be lower than during the past several weeks owing to
the cut in the discount rate.
Bracketed alternative language with respect to the aggregates
is suggested for consideration in view of the substantial shortfall in
growth of the broader aggregates from expectations at the time of the
March meeting.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

business outlook, and the exchange value of the dollar, the Committee
seeks to REDUCE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT

action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at
annual rates of around [DEL: 6, 7, and 8] ____,____, AND ____ percent,

AFTER SHOWING LITTLE CHANGE IN APRIL, ARE EXPECTED TO GROW AT
ANNUAL RATES OF ____ AND ____ PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OVER MAY AND
JUNE ON AVERAGE.] Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD) be
acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the mone-
tary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might (WOULD)
be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In
either case such a change would be considered in the context of
appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress
against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign
exchange markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consulta-
tion if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that
pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths
during the period before the next meeting is likely to be asso-
ciated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range
of [DEL: 6-to-10] ____ TO ____ percent.

","alternative B"
1985-10-01,15,"(15) Alternative A assumes a reduction of adjustment plus sea-
sonal borrowings to a $250 to $350 million range, or a cut in the discount
rate. The federal funds rate would drop to around 7-1/2 percent. The
percent range, around the low reached briefly in mid-June. Private short-
term rates would also decline. Quality spreads, which have tended to
widen in recent months, would probably narrow somewhat as debt servicing
burdens are lessened by lower market rates and in reflection of more
favorable odds of a strengthening in real economic growth. Market edginess
about Farm Credit System and FHLB securities is likely to persist, however,
until resolution of the problems of these agencies seem more clearly in
prospect. The international value of the dollar could be expected to move
lower, perhaps substantially given the context of the recent G-5 announce-
ment and intervention policy. In that case bond yields might not decline
in sympathy with short-term rates, partly for reasons noted in paragraph
(14) but also partly because of possible concerns about inflationary impli-
cations of a rapid drop in the dollar occurring in tandem with an easing of
money markets and relatively rapid M1 growth.
","Alternative A"
1986-04-01,15,"(15) Under alternative A, the stronger growth of M2--bolstered
by inflows from market instruments mainly into MMMFs and MMDAs--would move
this aggregate up into its longer-run range by June. The acceleration
of M3 would probably be less. Bank credit growth through the second
quarter would be further restrained by softness in business loans as
corporations rely more heavily on bond financing in response to a further
drop in long-term rates.
","alternative A"
1986-08-19,15,"(15) Short-term rates would decline appreciably, with the 3-month
Treasury bill rate falling toward 5-1/4 percent under alternative A. Bond
yields probably would also decline, but any sustained sizable drop likely
would require signs of continuing sluggishness in the economy and lack of
price pressures, as well as the absence of substantial weakness in the dollar.
The dollar could come under heavy selling pressure with this alternative,
unless key foreign central banks were also to take easing steps.
","alternative A"
1986-09-23,15,"(15) Under alternative A, growth in M2 and M3 of around 9-1/2
and 8-1/2 percent, respectively, would be anticipated from August through
December. Such growth would leave these aggregates a little above the upper
band of their annual ranges. Offering rates on retail deposits and money
market mutual funds would become even more favorable, at least for a while,
fostering heavy inflows into these instruments. Absent a policy reversal
in coming months, deposit flows are likely to remain strong into early 1987
supported in part by the emergence of somewhat more robust economic activity
than in the staff projection. M1 growth from August to December would be
expected to continue near its rapid pace for the year to date, bringing
growth for the year to 14-3/4 percent.
","alternative A"
1986-12-15,15,"(15) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with an
assumed $500 million of discount window borrowing. The federal funds rate
would rise to the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent area. The tighter reserve condi-
tions of this alternative would act to damp growth in M2 and M3; M2 would
be in the lower half and M3 close to the lower end of their tentative ranges
in March. Opportunity costs of the more liquid components of M2, in parti-
cular, would widen appreciably, restraining inflows to retail accounts, and
reduced overall funding needs of banks and thrifts associated with slower
asset growth would limit expansion of managed liabilities in M3. Growth in
Ml also would be damped by tighter reserve market conditions and accompany-
ing larger opportunity costs, although it probably would continue to advance
considerably more rapidly than GNP.
","alternative C"
1987-05-19,15,"(15) Alternative A, which assumes a reduction of borrowing at the
discount window to $200 million, would induce the federal funds rate to drop
back over time, probably to below 6 percent. The easing of reserve pressures
would tend to boost M2 growth in June to a 7 percent annual rate, thereby
limiting, though not preventing, a widening by June of the shortfall of M2
relative to the 5-1/2 percent lower bound of its annual range. Lower interest
rates and stronger nominal income growth than in the staff greenbook forecast
would be expected to boost M2 demand in the second half of the year, providing
greater assurance that this aggregate would grow within its range for the
year. The specified growth of M3 over these two months, at 6-1/4 percent,
would move this aggregate in June to just above the lower bound of its
range. M1 under this policy alternative would be expected to grow at only
a 4-3/4 percent average rate over the last two months of this quarter, but
its June pace of 10 percent would be more suggestive of its underlying momentum
entering the remainder of the year.
","Alternative A"
1987-08-18,15,"(15) Owing to the decline of short-term market interest rates
relative to offering rates on deposits, M2 growth under alternative A would
be expected to jump to 7 percent over August and September. Its M1 component
likely would accelerate to a 6-3/4 percent rate over the two months. Growth
of M2 would move noticeably closer to its long-term range, but in September
this aggregate still would have increased at only a 4-1/2 percent annual rate
from its fourth-quarter base. While the easing contemplated under this
alternative probably would have a pronounced effect on money growth in the
fourth quarter, whether M2 could hit the 5-1/2 percent lower bound of its
range without a further easing is uncertain. To make up the shortfall, a
percent to hit the bottom of the growth cone by December). For M3, the 7-1/2
percent growth foreseen for August and September under alternative A would
lift this aggregate to around the lower bound of its annual range. Prospects
would be good that the aggregate would move well within its range in the
fourth quarter; the steeper yield curve expected under this alternative would
provide additional incentives for businesses to focus credit demands on banks
and for home mortgage credit to be met through ARMs at thrifts.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1987-09-22,15,"(15) Alternative A assumes that reserve paths would be constructed
with borrowing of $400 million. Since markets have not yet adjusted to the
current $600 million objective, this alternative implies only a modest drop
in money market rates from current levels. The federal funds rate would
drift lower to below 7 percent, somewhat above its trading range before the
recent run-up in rates. Other private short-term rates also would decline,
perhaps by a quarter of a percentage point. Bill rates might drop very little
on balance once potential supply constraints eased. Even so, absent a clear
indication of weakness in the economy or lessened inflation concerns, market
participants probably would be surprised by any easing action caning on the
heels of the discount rate hike. The dollar might well come under consider-
able downward pressure, and this would tend to limit possible declines in
bond yields.
","Alternative A"
1987-11-03,15,"(15) Under the reserve market conditions of alternative B, most
bond yields might edge higher as the increased preference for fixed-income
securities subsides and the possibility of further near-term monetary ease
is seen as diminishing. However, market concerns about potential softness
in economic activity and the associated scaling back of inflation expecta-
tions could keep long-term rates below their levels at the time of the last
FOMC meeting. Downward pressures on the value of the dollar in foreign ex-
change markets could continue as market attention focuses on U.S. external
imbalances, and would be accentuated by any perceptions that foreign mone-
tary authorities were unwilling to adopt more expansionary policies. If
dollar weakness occurred in the context of subdued growth in the U.S. econ-
omy and, particularly around the time of the Treasury's midquarter refunding,
of continued foreign participation in U.S. securities markets, bond prices
might be little affected. But if pressures on the dollar are accentuated
by disappointing progress in federal deficit reduction or if U.S. economic
activity remains robust, an inverse relationship between the dollar and
bond yields could reemerge.
","alternative B"
1987-12-15,15,"(15) Lower short-term market rates relative to deposit offering
rates under alternative A would prompt more rapid inflows into M2-type
accounts. M2 growth from November to March would be expected to pick up
to 6 percent. Higher compensating balance requirements in response to
reduced market rates would boost business demand deposits, while more
savings-type balances would be diverted to NOW and other liquid accounts
in response to reduced opportunity costs. M1 growth of 6 percent
expected over November to March implies expansion at almost an 8 percent
rate in the early months of 1988, given the slow growth now in train for
December. The faster growth in core deposits likely would produce only
a partial offset in reduced issuance of managed liabilities in M3, as
greater loan demands would be placed on banks and thrifts in response to
generally easier credit conditions. With this alternative, M3 might
expand at around a 6-1/2 percent pace from November to March. By then,
M2 would be within, and M3 around the midpoint of, the FOMC's tentative
ranges for 1988.
","alternative A"
1988-02-09,15,"(15) Expected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
November to March under each alternative are shown in the table below, along
with associated federal funds rate ranges. Implied December to March growth
rates, which are higher owing to the weakness in December, also are shown,
should the Committee wish to shift the base for short-run money growth from

specifications. (More detailed data are shown on the table and charts on

1988-03-29,15,"(15) The broader monetary aggregates under alternative C would
post a more marked slowing over the course of the quarter than under the
other alternatives, as the effects of the rebound in market interest rates
increasingly took hold. Both aggregates would end the quarter a bit
closer to, though still above, the midpoints of their longer-run ranges.
The attractiveness of transactions and other liquid accounts would be
lessened further, as their rates lag in typical fashion behind market
yields. M1 probably would be growing very sluggishly by June, leaving its
growth from the fourth quarter to June a bit below its current 4 percent
rate through March.
","alternative C"
1988-12-13,15,"(15) M2 growth probably would be held down to a 3 percent annual
rate from November to March under alternative C, placing this aggregate just
at the lower end of its tentative 1989 target range. The higher funds rate
of this alternative would reinforce the restraining influence on M2 demand
of rate increases earlier this year. Given the still flatter market yield
curve, however, household demands for those liquid assets whose rates do
adjust promptly--such as money funds--could be relatively strong. With
higher market interest rates, M1 likely would remain about unchanged on
balance through March. Some restraint also would show through to M3, which
would be expected to post a 6-1/2 percent annual growth rate over the next
four months. Higher market interest rates would curb inflows to institu-

institutions somewhat, even as a further shifting of business credit demands

1989-03-28,15,"(15) With the lower money market rates of alternative A, M2 growth
would strengthen to a 4 percent pace, lifting it above the lower bound of
its growth cone by June. M3 would move more into the middle portion of
its range. The decline in other short-term market rates might be less
than the one-half point drop in the federal funds rate, depending on per-
ceptions of the sustainability of the policy easing. The dollar could
fall substantially. Investors are likely to be confounded by this
policy action, which would be seen as reversing the thrust of policy over
the past year. Unless subsequent data suggested substantial weakness in
the economy and price pressures, inflation expectations and bond yields
ultimately could rise under this alternative.

1989-11-14,15,"(15) The recent easing, which would be maintained under alterna-
tive B, and any additional easing under alternative A, would have impor-
tant effects on money growth in the first quarter of next year. Under
alternative B, M2 would expand around the 7 percent upper limit of its
tentative range in the early months of 1990. Alternative A likely would
yield M2 growth noticeably above the upper end of the tentative growth
cone, though well within the parallel lines. Under either alternative, M3
would grow in the lower half of the 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 tentative range for
this aggregate.

1989-12-18,15,"(15) The easing of policy under alternative A would be a little
more than now seems to be anticipated by market participants over coming
weeks. In response to a drop in the federal funds rate to the 8 percent
area, money market interest rates would decrease about 3/8 percentage
point, with the three-month bill trading around 7-1/4 percent. Bond rates
should move lower, especially if market participants viewed the economy as
being fairly weak so that such a measure would not appreciably raise the
risk of higher inflation, though judging from the tepid response of bond
markets to the putative easing around Thanksgiving, any declines might be
small. The dollar could weaken significantly further.
","alternative A"
1990-03-27,15,"(15) Under the less restrictive policy posture of alternative A,
M2 and M3 growth from March to June would be boosted to 7 and 4-1/2 per-
cent rates, respectively. M2 would be close to the 7 percent upper limit
of its annual range, and on a trajectory that would carry it above its
upper bound in the third quarter. M3 would remain well below its midpoint
in June, reflecting both the downsizing of the thrift industry and a lower
responsiveness than M2 to movements in market interest rates. Under the
tighter financial market conditions of alternative C, M2 and M3 growth
from March to June likely would slow to 5 and 3-1/2 percent rates,
respectively. M2 growth from the fourth-quarter base of its annual range
to June would be 6 percent. The associated growth for M3 by June would be

","alternative A, alternative C"
1990-08-21,15,"(15) Under alternative C, a considerable backup in short-term
rates would appear likely, as a monetary policy tightening would fly in
the face of market expectations. Long-term rates might rise only a
little, as the increase in real interest rates would be at least partly
offset by a lessening in inflation expectations. The moderation in
inflation expectations would accompany a further downward adjustment of
market participants' outlook for real economic activity--as the effects of
higher real rates were reinforced by an even more cautious attitude of
lenders--and evidence that the Federal Reserve was leaning against the
price effects of the oil shock. The dollar could find renewed strength on
foreign exchange markets as interest differentials moved in favor of
dollar investments. M2 and M3 growth over the third quarter would be
restrained to 3-1/2 and 2-1/4 percent, respectively.

1990-10-02,15,"(15) Under alternative B, with some reversal of recent declines
in bill rates, opportunity costs are not expected to be a significant
influence on M2 growth over the next few months. Still, velocity would
decline at a 2 percent annual rate since the 4 percent growth of M2 from
September to December under this alternative would imply quarterly average
growth of 4-3/4 percent. Money demand is not expected to react much over
coming months to the sharp decline in nominal GNP growth in the fourth
quarter; such a decline would not be seen as indicative of the behavior of
permanent income, and nominal consumption spending is expected to remain
strong. Under alternative A, the drop in opportunity costs would boost

mutual funds and, to a lesser extent, retail deposits are expected to
respond to the drop in their opportunity costs brought about by the de-
clines in short-term market rates over recent months. Even so, M2 growth
on a quarterly average basis would edge up to only a 2-3/4 percent rate in
the first quarter, which would be below the projected pace of nominal GNP
and represent a reversal of the decline in M2 velocity experienced this
","alternative B"
1991-03-26,15,"(15) Growth in M3 would slow to a 3-1/2 percent rate over the
March-to-June period in the case of alternative B. To be sure, a modest
pickup in bank lending and in the associated needs for funds is antici-
pated as credit demands strengthen with spending; banks should be willing
to meet this demand in light of improved prospects for borrowers, enhanced
access to capital markets and the recent regulatory initiatives. However,
rate relationships are expected to be less favorable to money funds. In
addition, the unusual issuance of large time deposits by U.S. branches of
foreign banks related to the reserve requirement cut is assumed to slow in
the second quarter. RTC resolution activity will pick up over the quar-
ter, so that increasing quantities of thrift assets will end up financed
by Treasury securities instead of M3. Even with its slowing, M3 would
remain above the midpoint of its annual range by June. On a quarterly
average basis, M3 would grow at a 4-1/2 percent rate in the second quar-
ter, once again lagging growth in nominal income.
","alternative B"
1991-10-01,15,"(15) The 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds
rate under alternative A would promote faster money growth than under
alternative B, improving the odds that the aggregates would end up in
the ranges. However, relative to previous bluebooks, the staff has
scaled back its estimate of the response of M2 growth to such a policy
easing. Rather than the customary 1-1/2 percentage point increment to
the growth rate of M2, we now estimate that the added growth would be
more on the order of 1 percentage point at an annual rate. With
returns on non-M1 components of M2 reaching their lowest levels in
several years and falling further relative both to rates on capital
market instruments and to household borrowing costs, households will
have stronger incentives from these channels to pare holdings of non-
transactions M2. This reasoning yields projected M2 growth over the
next three months under alternative A of 4 percent at an annual rate.
Our estimate of the responsiveness of M1 and M3 growth to monetary
policy easing, however, remains approximately unchanged, implying
growth rates of these aggregates of 8 and 2 percent, respectively,
from September to December.

1991-12-17,15,"(15) Under alternative B, both M2 and M3 are projected to grow
a little more slowly than their average rates over October and November.
M2 would be expected to post a 3 percent growth rate from November to
March, and M3 a 1-1/2 percent rate. Nominal income is projected to
grow at about the same rates in the fourth and first quarters, and
given the usual lags, the effects on money demand of the declines in
interest rates through early December also would be roughly comparable
in the two quarters. It is the resumption of RTC activity early next
year that is responsible for the slight ebbing of M2 growth. Restraint
on M3 growth will be exerted not only by heavier RTC activity but also
by a moderation in the expansion of bank credit and funding needs with
the fading of special factors that have boosted bank lending recently.
","alternative B"
1992-03-31,15,"(15) Under the lower interest rates of alternative A, M2 is
expected to grow at a 4-1/2 percent rate over the March-to-June period,
keeping this aggregate around the midpoint of its 1992 target range.
The decline in market rates would boost inflows to M1 accounts and money
market mutual funds, although the still-lower return on retail balances
in M2 relative to those seen on capital market instruments would again
encourage some M2 holders to divert balances to the bond and equity
markets. M3 would continue to grow at a 2 percent rate over the March-
to-June period, remaining noticeably above the lower end of its range.
","alternative A"
1992-05-19,15,"(15) The growth of M2, M3, and debt through June would be
little affected by either the easing or tightening of reserve conditions
under alternatives A or C. More of the impact of these actions could be
expected to be felt in the second half of the year. If the lower funds
rate of alternative A is maintained through year-end, growth of M2 for
the year could be expected to come in around 4 percent. Some impetus to
money demand would derive from the reduced opportunity cost of holding
liquid balances and, later in the year, from added strength in spending.
If alternative C is adopted and the higher rates maintained, a 3 percent
annual pace for M2 would be more likely. Overall, based on recent ex-
perience, the impetus from changed short-term interest rates is project-
ed to have a considerably smaller effect on M2 growth than embodied in
historical relationships. While growth of M3 for the year of 2 percent
is expected under the constant funds rate of alternative B, this projec-
tion would have to be shaded up or down by perhaps 1/4 point if alterna-
tive A or C were chosen at this FOMC meeting and sustained for the rest
of the year.

","alternative A, alternative C, alternative B"
1992-08-18,15,"(15) Under alternative C, M2 and M3 would drop further below
their annual ranges, as opportunity costs widen, banks become even
more cautious lenders, and income growth is more restrained. The
effects on M1 would be especially marked in the fourth quarter, given
the drop in mortgage prepayments that would accompany the backup in
long-term rates. Still, M1 would be expected to increase at a 10 per-
cent rate from June to December.

","alternative C"
1992-10-06,15,"(15) Under alternative A, M2 and M3 likely would grow at
rates of 2-3/4 and 1-1/4 percent over the September-to-December
interval. The two aggregates should be on a somewhat steeper trajec-
tory into next year, raising the odds that they would be within their
tentative ranges in the early months of 1993. In addition to the
limited stimulus to M2 demands arising from the reduction in oppor-
tunity costs, spending by then should have begun to respond to the
monetary policy easing embodied in alternative A. Real interest rates
would be lower than under alternative B, though actual declines in
real rates may be limited by a continued ebbing of inflation expec-
tations. Although some kinds of spending may now be less responsive
to interest rates, lower rates still would speed balance sheet
strengthening, buoy wealth, and support net exports.

1993-05-18,15,"(15) Households and businesses are expected to stay cautious
in using credit in coming months. In the household sector, mortgage
refinancing activity is likely to remain brisk. Overall mortgage debt,
however, is expected to expand at about its first-quarter pace, as cash-
out refinancing activity continues to be limited and home purchases rise
only gradually. Growth of consumer credit is projected to remain
moderate, despite heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other
incentives. Given still-favorable conditions in longer-term markets
under alternative B, issuance of corporate bonds and stocks should
remain relatively heavy. With the shortfall of internal funds relative
to capital expenditures remaining small, businesses are likely to con-
tinue to use the proceeds of securities issuance to pay down higher-cost
bonds and bank loans. Treasury borrowing should pick up in coming
months to finance a widening deficit, with more issuance in the shorter
end of the market, reflecting the recent shift in debt management
policy. Domestic nonfinancial debt would be expected to move further
above the lower edge of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range
through June.

costs as deposit rates, especially those on small time deposits, moved
up in lagged response to earlier increases in market rates. Renewed

households may continue to rebalance portfolios in a way that might
also impart some upward tilt to growth of the broader aggregates.
Restraining monetary growth is some projected slowing of nominal
income growth, even under the unchanged interest rate assumptions of
this alternative.10 M2 velocity would rise at around a 3 percent
rate in the third and fourth quarters, somewhat slower than over the
first half and about in line with predictions of traditional models of
money demand.11 M3 is projected to grow at a 3/4 percent pace in
the July-to-December period, a bit less slowly than in the first half
of the year. Abstracting from the effects of FIN 39, we expect a
little more growth in bank credit over the second half of the year--
though not a persistence of the unusually rapid increase in July.
Moreover, with short-term rates unchanged under alternative B, insti-
tution-only money funds should be stable after large runoffs through
the spring.

1994-11-15,15,"(15) Forecasted growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
October to March and from the fourth quarter of this year through
March under both policy alternatives are shown below.5  (More
detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following pages.)
Under alternative B, offering rates through the first quarter would
continue to adjust upward in the face of steady money market rates.
As a result, retail deposit inflows are projected to strengthen
gradually, yielding growth rates for M2 of 1 percent over the October
to March interval and 1-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 to
March. The resumption of quarterly average growth, at a 1 percent
rate in the first quarter, combined with a projected slowing of
nominal GDP, would be associated with a reduced growth rate of 4-3/4
percent of M2 velocity, down from a projected increase of 7-1/4 per-
cent in the fourth quarter. M1 is projected to decline at a 1 percent
rate from October to March under alternative B, as currency flows
abroad remain robust but demand and other checkable deposits continue
to decline. The staff does not expect banks to continue to run
off securities at the recent pace, so that the growth of bank credit
should pick up. Rapid issuance of large time deposits will continue
to fill some of the gap left by still-sluggish retail deposits, and
thus M3 is projected to outpace M2 from October to March, likely
expanding at a 2-1/2 percent rate under alternative B.

1994-12-20,15,"(15) Under alternative B, M2 would strengthen to a 1-1/4
percent rate over the November-to-March period. Opportunity costs of
holding M2--especially the small time deposit and money market mutual
funds components--should narrow from current high levels as retail
deposit and money fund rates continue to adjust upward to recent in-
creases in market rates. As a result, growth in M2 velocity would
slow to a 5 percent rate in the first quarter of next year from a 7
percent rate in the current quarter. M1 would continue to edge down-
ward in response to previous increases in opportunity costs, although
the drag from the slowdown of mortgage refinancing activity will be
diminishing as such activity stabilizes at relatively low levels.7
Boosted in part by faster growth in M2, M3 would be expected to grow
at a 2-1/4 percent rate over the November-to-March period. In
addition, a pickup in M3-type money market mutual funds, as rates on
such funds catch up with market rates, would act to lift M3 growth.

1995-08-22,15,"(15) Growth rates of the broad monetary aggregates are ex-
pected to continue to slow from their recent very rapid pace, but to
remain relatively strong. Portfolio shifts into M2 assets should
abate with the stability of short-term rates and now-higher long-term
rates, which make bond funds more attractive. The velocity of M2 is
expected to decline in the third quarter, but primarily because of
the bulge in M2 growth already experienced. In the fourth quarter,
velocity is projected to be flat. For the year, M2 is expected to
remain below the 5 percent upper bound of its annual range, even under
alternative A.4  The projected softening in M3 owes primarily to
lower growth in institutional money funds as their yields become
better aligned with market rates. Bank credit is expected to expand
at a moderate pace, and issuance of managed liabilities in M3 should
remain strong, perhaps encouraged to a small degree by the recent
decline in deposit insurance premiums. M3 appears likely to break the
upper bound of its new range under any of the alternative policy
settings. (A table showing the growth rates of the monetary aggre-

1995-09-26,15,"(15) The 1/2 percentage point hike in the funds rate of
alternative C would catch market participants off guard. Their inter-
pretation of the action, of course, would be conditioned by the word-
ing of the accompanying announcement, which presumably would emphasize
more aggressive pursuit of the Committee's longer-run price stability
objective. In that context, the sharp jump in money market interest
rates may be accompanied by a much more muted increase in bond yields,
if longer-term inflation expectations were favorably affected. If the
impact on inflation expectations were negligible, though, an appreci-
able selloff in the bond market could result. In any event, some
intermediate-term rates--real and nominal--would rise significantly as
market participants revised up their expected path for short-term
rates for some time into the future. The exchange value of the dollar
likely would strengthen.

1995-11-15,15,"(15) The table below presents expected growth of money and
debt under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. In
credit markets, supply conditions are expected to remain generally
favorable. However, the likely cutback in business lending by Japa-
nese banks and possible tendency for consumer lenders to become more
selective suggest that credit may become less freely available for
some borrowers. Nonetheless, borrowing by nonfederal sectors is
expected to firm a little from the subdued pace of recent months. For
businesses, strong cash flow and some slowing in the pace of inventory
accumulation will act to hold down financing needs, although this
effect will be offset by the scheduled completion of some large merg-
ers and associated share retirements in coming months. In the house-
hold sector, debt growth will be sustained in the near term in financ-
ing further healthy advances in durable goods outlays and fairly
robust housing activity. Total nonfederal debt is projected to expand
at below a 5 percent annual rate over late 1995 and early 1996. Fed-
eral borrowing will be light in the months immediately ahead, even
absent a spending lapse or debt-ceiling crisis, before strengthening
late in the winter. Taken together, total nonfinancial sector debt is
projected to grow 5-1/4 percent in 1995, around the middle of its
monitoring range, and to maintain that pace early in 1996.

money market conditions of alternative B.7 Broad measures of money
and credit are expected to pick up some in coming months, partly in
conjunction with stronger growth in nominal GDP. Credit supply condi-
tions should remain favorable under that outlook, especially for
firms. Households reduce their borrowing a bit in view of slackening
growth of spending on durables and rising debt-service difficulties,
but growth of their debt still outpaces that of nominal income. Busi-
ness borrowing picks up, buoyed by a brisk pace of merger deals.
Although firms are drawn to the bond market by attractive long-term
rates, borrowing from shorter-term sources, including banks, remains
substantial. Total debt growth accelerates to a 5 percent pace over
the November-March period, leaving domestic nonfinancial sector debt
near the middle of its provisional 3-to-7 percent monitoring range.

1997-12-16,15,"(15) Growth of the broad money aggregates is expected to moderate from the recent
rapid pace, as the expansion of nominal GDP slows in the first quarter. M2 growth is
projected at around a 4 percent annual pace over the November-to-March period under
alternative B, leaving this aggregate near the upper end of its provisional 1998 range.
Nonetheless, growth in M2 would again outpace that of nominal GDP in the first quarter of
November-to-March period, as growth in bank credit ebbs and some of the shifting in the
composition of bank managed liabilities diminishes. Nonetheless, growth in M3--at a 6-1/2
percent rate--is expected to run above the upper end of its provisional range for 1998.
","alternative B"
1998-03-31,15,"(15) The moderation in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates under
alternative B owes in part to a slowdown in GDP and bank credit as business lending and
acquisitions of securities slacken and banks become less aggressive in seeking funding.
Nonetheless, M3 is projected to grow at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate over the March-to-
September period as depository credit growth still stays fairly brisk. As a consequence, M3
would stand 9-1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter base in June and 8-1/2 percent above that base
in September. Growth in M2 is projected to slow to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate over the
March-to-September period. We are projecting that, in the absence of changes in opportunity
costs, M2 growth in an underlying sense will return to a pace close to that of GDP in the
period ahead. Nevertheless, V2 is expected to decrease in the second quarter because of the
effects on liquid balances of the current heavy pace of mortgage refinancing, as well as the
high levels of tax refunds and anticipated April tax payments; in the third quarter, however,
V2 is likely to rise somewhat, as those refinancing and tax effects on deposit levels are
removed. The deceleration in M2 brings growth from the fourth quarter of 1997 to June to a
by September.

","alternative B"
1998-05-19,15,"(15) Projected M3 growth under alternative B would dip to a 5-1/2 percent rate from
April through September, reflecting some expected reduction in the growth of depository
funding needs associated with the anticipated marked slowing in depository credit expansion
over that interval. The rapid rate of securities acquisitions of late 1997 and earlier this year,
which appeared to be related to some large banks' efforts to increase leverage, is expected to
slow. The pace of lending, too, is likely to remain below that of the first four months of the
year as credit demands moderate. From the fourth quarter through September, M3 is seen as
advancing at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, and for the year as a whole at 8-1/4 percent, well above
the upper bound of its 2 to 6 percent annual range.
Directive Language
","alternative B"
1998-12-22,15,"(15) Under alternative B, conditions in credit markets could well improve after the turn
of the year, but lenders should stay on the cautious side as the growth of economic activity slows
and profits and incomes soften further. This caution is likely to keep the price of credit elevated
for more marginal business borrowers, but other businesses should continue to find credit readily
available. Most households, too, are unlikely to face unusual credit stringency, although lenders
will probably remain selective. As the growth of spending slows, business and household
borrowing should decelerate over coming quarters. Overall nonfinancial debt should slow to a
provisional range for 1999.

1999-11-16,15,"(15) Under alternative B, the staff expects that M2 will grow 6 percent this year
and M3 7-1/4 percent, compared with the 5 and 6 percent upper bounds of their respective
annual ranges. Built into these projections is a pickup in growth over the last two months
of the year to a 8-1/4 percent pace for M2 and an 11-1/4 percent pace for M3. The staff
estimates that approximately 2 and 3 percentage points of these respective growth rates will
be attributable to the impact of Y2K concerns in temporarily boosting demands for
monetary assets that are regarded as safe and liquid. These effects are reversed by the end
of February. Smoothing through Y2K effects, the staff forecasts M2 and M3 to expand
from October to March at rates of 6-1/2 and 7-1/4 percent, respectively.

indication in the announcement following the August meeting that In these
circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable
period.  The combination of developments over the intermeeting periodespecially
the juxtaposition of an apparent strengthening of aggregate demand with a seeming
further acceleration in productivity that had the net effect of widening somewhat the
staffs projection of the output gapmight be viewed as warranting the reiteration of
such a statement.  However, the Committee might not be convinced that recent
trends in productivity are likely to persist, and thus it may see a good possibility that
policy will need to be firmed sooner than assumed in the Greenbook forecast, perhaps
along the lines indicated by futures rates.  The Committee presumably will want to
remove the statement from the announcement in advance of any policy tightening.
However, dropping it at this point would likely prompt an adverse reaction in
financial markets, including not the least a backup in interest rates.  An alternative
approach would be to condition the statement on economic developments.  For
example, the Committee could indicate that . . . policy accommodation likely can be
maintained for the considerable period that the Committee expects will be required to
achieve satisfactory economic performance.  Rates could back up some even in this
case if investors read the language as an effort by the Committee to take a step back

2004-08-10,15,"(15) If the Committee sees the recent slower growth of aggregate demand as
likely to be transitory but suspects that the pickup in core inflation could well be more
durable than the staff anticipates, it might choose to raise the funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting, as in Alternative C.  FOMC members may consider inflation
already to be close to the top of an acceptable range and see several reasons to
question the decline in inflation in the staff forecast.  With inflation expectations
remaining in a 2 to 3 percent range, well above the Greenbook forecast, the
Committee may believe that underlying inflation has considerable momentum.  Also,
high energy prices may prove to be longer lasting than anticipated by the staff forecast
and the markets, providing less downward pressure on overall inflation.  Policymakers
may see less slack in prospect than in the Greenbook projection, because they may
perceive the economy as already close to its potential or the growth rate of potential
output as lower than estimated by the staff.  Finally, Committee members might be
uneasy about inflation prospects if they place less weight on the most recent spending
indicators and foresee more robust growth in aggregate demand than in the staff
forecast, perhaps along the lines of the Spending Rebound scenario in the
Greenbook.  In light of these considerations, the FOMC may judge a 25-basis-point
move at this meetingwhich would leave the real funds rate in negative territoryas
insufficient, whereas a 50-basis-point move would at least bring the real rate to around
","Alternative C"
2004-09-21,15,"(15) In the description of economic developments in the statement, the
Committee could relate that Output appears to be regaining traction and, reflecting the
slightly better employment report for August and the relatively low level of initial
claims for unemployment, assert that labor market conditions have improved modestly.
Regarding price developments, the announcement could indicate, as in Alternatives A
and B, that Inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months but add that
elevated energy prices continue to put upward pressure on costs and prices.  The appropriate risk
assessment under Alternative C poses a difficult issue.  If an assessment of balanced
risks were retained, the deletion of the final two sentences of the statement would
remove any explicit sense that policy firming would continue, leaving the earlier
indication that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as the only
hint of the future direction of policy.  This concern could conceivably be remedied if
the Committee chose, as discussed at the August meeting, to condition its risk
assessment explicitly on an unchanged federal funds rate and judge that the risks to
growth and inflation under that assumption were tilted to the upside.  However,
members might be concerned that such an approach would lead to a sharp upward
revision in market participants expectations for the path of policy.
","Alternative C"
2004-11-10,15,"(15) Given the disappointing data on employment and industrial production in
recent months, along with the mixed signals from other economic indicators, the
Committees assessment of the near-term prospects for spending and employment
might be less optimistic than in the staff forecast.  In particular, members might read
the meager pace of hiring since the spring and weak high-tech spending as evidence of
continued reluctance on the part of firms to make significant commitments in the
current environment.  The still-weak tone in labor markets also might be viewed as a
factor depressing consumer confidence and so weighing on household spending.  In
that circumstance, the Committee might see less need to continue removing policy
accommodation at this meeting and choose to keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent and
issue a statement like that shown in Alternative A.  Even if the Committee judged the
staff forecast as likely, it might consider the projected progress in working down slack
as too slow to be acceptable, especially given that core PCE inflation runs at
concerns about disinflation were acute.  The Committee might also be concerned
about possible downside risks to the forecast from high oil prices and the potential
for a deceleration in consumer spending similar to that in the faltering expansion
scenario in the Greenbook.
","Alternative A"
2004-12-14,15,"(15) The release of the announcement for Alternative B would likely lead to
some easing of financial conditions.  Although investors have priced in a 25-basis-
point increase in the target federal funds rate at this meeting, they do not anticipate
that the statement will signal the possibility of a pause.  As a result, the statement
could well induce investors to mark down their expected path for the federal funds
rate over coming quarters.  Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would decline
some, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably also fall.  Stock
prices would likely rise a bit.
","Alternative B"
2005-02-01,15,"(15) If the Committee believes that continued policy firming will likely prove
sufficient to check inflationary pressures while allowing economic slack to be worked
down in an acceptable manner, it might be inclined to raise the target funds rate
another 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  Such an increase would
further unwind the unusual degree of policy accommodation prevailing over the past
several years, seen in Chart 8 as the movement of the real funds rate closer to
estimates of its equilibrium, which themselves moved back to a more typical range in
the last year or so.  It would also be consistent with the long-run scenario of
maintaining a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, as discussed above, and
with several policy rules based on that objective (Chart 9).  While the Committee may
be concerned that financial markets will remain accommodative even after this move,
perhaps encouraging excessive risk-taking, it might also believe that a larger action at

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a models projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  With the exception of the TIPS-consistent measure, the real federal 
funds rates employ the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.  TIPS indexation is 
based on the total CPI.
Measure Description
Single-Equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields reflects the short-term real interest rate expected to 
prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium.  The term premium is 
assumed to be 70 basis points.

and perhaps roil financial markets.
","Alternative B"
2005-03-22,15,"(15) Under either Alternative A or C, the Committee may judge that the
measured-pace language is no longer consistent with the likely future course of policy.
Some might view this wordingat least as it has come to be interpreted in the
markets after six quarter-point firmings with unchanged languageas ruling out a
potential pause in policy at upcoming meetings.  At the same time, that wording might
be regarded as potentially constraining on the upside if the Committee saw a
significant likelihood that it might need to accelerate the process of removing policy
accommodation.  Indeed, members might not choose to firm 50 basis points at this
meeting because of the force of such a constraint.  As a result, the Committee might
wish to strike the measured-pace language from its statement at this meeting.  To
accomplish this while still providing a general signal about the probable future
direction of policy, the Committee could make its risk assessments conditional on an
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 37
unchanged target federal funds rate for the next few quarters.  For Alternatives A and
C, the Committee could then indicate that it is more likely than not that the growth
of output would exceed its sustainable pace and that inflation pressures would pick
up.  The last sentence of the paragraph could underscore the importance of
economic prospects as a guide for policymakers in judging the pace at which policy
accommodation should be removed.
","Alternative A"
2005-05-03,15,"(15) The statement accompanying selection of Alternative A could employ
virtually the same text on aggregate spending and labor market conditions suggested
for Alternative Bbut omitting the word somewhatas follows:  Recent data
suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed, partly in response to the
earlier increases in energy prices.  Labor market conditions, however, apparently
continue to improve gradually.  Regarding inflation, the sentence offered under
Alternative B could be modified under this alternative by saying, While pressures
on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,
longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.  Also, consistent with a
relatively benign view of inflation, the penultimate sentence could be changed to
begin With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low  The second
sentence of the announcement could be altered to indicate that the stance of
monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative, implying that the amount of
policy accommodation still to be removed had been reduced.  Correspondingly, in
the second-to-last sentence, the Committee could refer to remaining policy
accommodation instead of just to policy accommodation.  Finally, to reinforce
that the trajectory for policy could involve a near-term pause, the statement could
refer to appropriate monetary policy instead of appropriate monetary policy
action in the assessment of risks.

will begin to flatten out around year-end, but market commentary and survey evidence
indicate that investors do not anticipate that the FOMC will signal any such
development next week.  Accordingly, a statement employing the draft wording
shown in Alternative A would likely produce a noticeable downward shift in interest
rates implied by money market futures quotes, as investors priced in a slower pace of
policy action and probably also revised down the likely extent of cumulative
tightening.  That change in policy outlook would likely prompt a rally in bond and

2005-11-01,15,"(15) Committee members may wish to consider Alternative A if they think that
the recent moderate rates of core inflation are likely to continue and if they see the
outlook for the economy as especially uncertain because of the effects of the
hurricanes and elevated energy prices.  Particularly if the Committee, like the staff,
views the real federal funds rate as in the vicinity of its equilibrium level, a pause in
policy firming might be seen as desirable, partly to await further readings on consumer
and business sentiment and spending.  Such a pause may also be chosen if members
believe that the real estate market is in the process of softening, which heretofore has
been an important spur to household spending.  Under this alternative, the
Committee might refer to remaining policy accommodation in the final risk
assessment paragraph.  Markets would be surprised at the decision to leave the target
funds rate unchanged.  Short-term interest rates would probably decline considerably
as markets lowered the probability of near-term tightening moves.  Longer-term
interest rates might be little changed or even back up if investors saw the FOMC as
more tolerant than they expected of an increase in inflation.  The foreign exchange
value of the dollar would likely fall, especially if inflation expectations deteriorated.

2005-12-13,15,"(15) Should the Committee be particularly concerned about the inflation outlook
and still see the stance of policy as accommodative, it may prefer Alternative C.  While
energy prices have eased this fall, they remain much higher than a year ago, and other
commodity prices have increased as well.  And although labor costs have generally
been well-behaved of late, the Committee may believe that labor market slack has
been essentially eliminated.  Aggregate demand has proven quite resilient in the face
of higher interest rates and hurricane-related disruptions, and it will be boosted
further in coming quarters by rebuilding in the Gulf region.  Given this apparent
momentum to economic activity, members may be concerned about the risk that the
short-term equilibrium real federal funds rate could be considerably higher than most
of the staff estimates and aggregate demand could significantly overshoot the
economys potential.  Moreover, in current circumstances the Committee may be
concerned that it will need to boost the federal funds rate to a level above its
equilibrium if the temporary boost to inflation caused by the run-up in energy and
other commodity prices begins to be built into expected inflation along the lines of
the deteriorating inflation expectations alternative Greenbook scenario.  As a result,
the Committee may believe that it is premature to give a signal that the end of this
policy tightening phase is in sight.

2006-01-31,15,"(15) Although the proposed wording for Alternative B suggests greater
uncertainty about future policy moves, it continues to indicate that the risks are tilted
toward the possibility of further policy firming.  It would state that some further
policy firming may well be needed to keep risks in balance, replacing is likely to
with may well in that phrase.  The proposed wording would also drop the word
measured, as some may believe that the phrase may imply more than one future
move.  The minutes of the December meeting likely helped prepare markets not to
interpret the dropping of the word measured as a signal that the Committee
expected to move policy in larger increments going forward.  If the Committee
wanted to stress the role incoming data will play in its deliberations on further action,
it may want to reverse the order of rows 4 and 5 and delete In any event.  The
wording in Table 1 does not do so on the thought that the Committee would prefer
to make relatively few changes to the statement at this time.  Some members may be
uncomfortable with the language of Table 1 either because they believe that further
firming will be unnecessary or that the Committee should get out of the business of
signaling its policy intent.  In either case, it might be appropriate to strike row 4 and
rely on a revised version of row 5 to underscore the uncertainties surrounding policy
and the necessity of being responsive to economic data.  In particular, row 5 could

2006-03-27,15,"(15) With its more hawkish rationale paragraph and balance of risks language,
the adoption of Alternative C would cause short-term interest rates to firm.  Longer-
term interest rates might increase, especially if investors were to interpret the

Recent indicators suggest that

The Committee views the pickup in 
core inflation this spring as 
unwelcome but likely to be transitory.  
Ongoing productivity gains, anchored 
inflation expectations, and moderate 
economic growth should reduce 
inflation in coming quarters.
Readings on core inflation have been 
elevated in recent months.  Ongoing 
productivity gains have held down the 
rise in unit labor costs, and inflation 
expectations remain contained.  
However, the high levels of resource 
utilization and of the prices of energy

potential to sustain inflation pressures.
Ongoing productivity gains and

The Committee judges that the risks to

tilted to the upside but recognizes that 
the moderation in the growth of 
aggregate demand, along with other 
forces, should work to contain 
inflation going forward.  While the 
Committee judges that some further 
policy firming may yet be needed to 
address inflation risks, considerable 
uncertainty attends the outlook, 
making it prudent to await the 
accumulation of additional 
information.

In order to foster price stability and

accomplish this outcome.  The 
extent and timing of any such 
firming will depend importantly on 
the evolution of the economic 
outlook as implied by incoming

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding models projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staffs estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.
Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
models simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 41
to inflation pressure, including taut resource markets and elevated oil and commodity
prices, and acknowledge the recent pickup in core inflation.  The rationale could also
unit labor costs and the continued containment of inflation expectations.  To indicate
that further tightening was possible but not certain, the assessment of risk could note
that, while forces that should restrain inflation were at work, the risks to inflation
continued to be on the upside.  The Committee could again note that any further
policy action will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.

now roughly in balance, it may be attracted to the policy choice and wording of
Alternative A.  The Committee may see greater downside risks to economic growth
than it did in June.  Among other developments, the incoming information on the
housing sector may be viewed as suggesting the possibility of a more prolonged and
sizable reduction in residential construction and spending than is currently anticipated
by the staff, along the lines of the housing slump alternative Greenbook scenario.
The incoming data pointing to a slowing in economic growth may also have increased
the Committees confidence that the recent elevated inflation readings are unlikely to

roughly consistent with an optimal policy path suggested by a simulation of the
FRB/US model with a long-run inflation objective of 2 percent (Chart 7).

2006-09-20,15,"(15) In contrast, with overall economic activity apparently decelerating further in
the current quarter, inflation data for July more favorable than in preceding months,
and energy and other commodity prices down notably in recent weeks, the Committee
may now view the upside risks to inflation as having diminished somewhat and as
roughly balanced by the downside risks to economic activity.  If so, the Committee
may be attracted to Alternative A, under which the stance of policy would be
maintained at this meeting and the statement would no longer suggest a predilection
to firm policy going forward.  While moderate economic growth may be viewed as the
modal outcome under an unchanged federal funds rate, the downside risks to growth
may seem considerable in light of the most recent data pointing to a more
pronounced slowing in housing activity, a possibility that is illustrated by the housing
slump scenario in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the Committee may see the recent
decline in the prices of oil and other commodities as potentially signaling a slowdown
in global economic growth.  In any case, with the real federal funds rate at the upper
end of the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium (Chart 7), policy may
now be in a stance that is consistent with below-potential economic growth going
forward, so that resource pressures are likely to diminish some.  And, if the
Committee believes that energy prices probably will not return to their higher levels of

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding models projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staffs estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.

earlier this year, it may view inflation pressures as likely to ebb slowly, such as in the
Greenbook forecast.  If so, the Committee may not see particularly high odds that
policy will need to be tightened further.
","Alternative A"
2006-12-12,15,"(15) To acknowledge the downside risks to growth, the statement accompanying
Alternative A would note that the ongoing adjustment of the housing market could
have a more pronounced effect on growth in coming quarters than anticipated.
The Committee may also wish to recognize the slight decline in some measures of
core inflation in recent months by noting that Readings on core inflation have
improved modestly since the spring.  Even so, the statement would stress that
readings on core inflation remain elevated.  Given the competing risks to inflation
and growth, the risk assessment would simply note that In these circumstances,

2007-01-30,15,"(15) The implications for monetary policy of better-than-expected news on both
inflation and economic growth may be seen as roughly offsetting, suggesting that the
Committee has little reason to alter its current policy stance and risk assessment.  If
so, the Committee may be attracted to Alternative B, under which the federal funds
rate would remain unchanged at 5¼ percent and the statement would continue to
highlight concern about inflation.  The Committee may see the contours of the staff
projectionoutput running close to its potential and core inflation edging down to
current circumstances.  In the staffs analysis, the real federal funds rate is near the
Greenbook-consistent measure of its equilibrium value (Chart 5), suggesting that the
current policy stance is likely to be consistent with fostering output near potential
over time.  Maintaining the current policy stance would be consistent with
prescriptions from both the optimal policy path simulations of the FRB/US model
(Chart 6) and the first-difference rule (Chart 7), based on an assumed 2 percent
inflation objective.  Although the Committee may view inflation running at or above

Rationale 3.  Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated, and the high level of 
resource utilization has the potential 
to sustain inflation pressures.  
However, inflation pressures seem 
likely to moderate over time, 
reflecting reduced impetus from 
energy prices, contained inflation 
expectations, and the cumulative 
effects of monetary policy actions and 
other factors restraining aggregate 
demand.
Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly in recent months, 
and inflation pressures seem likely to 
moderate over time, partly reflecting 
the recent decline in energy prices.
Readings on core inflation have

and inflation pressures seem likely to

high level of resource utilization has 
the potential to sustain inflation

Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly in recent months 
but remain elevated.  Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate over

moderation remain uncertain.
Assessment of 
Risk
In these circumstances, future policy 
adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.
The Committee judges that some 
inflation risks remain.  The extent and 
timing of any additional firming that 
may be needed to address these risks 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by

remains the predominant concern, and 
consequently that in the near term 
policy firming is more likely than policy 
easing.  Future policy adjustments will 
depend on the evolution of the outlook 
for both inflation and economic 
growth, as implied by incoming 
information.

especially given the potentially delicate state of the housing sector, may persuade the
Committee to refrain from tightening at this time.  If so, the Committee may continue
to indicate that inflation is the predominant risk to the outlook, especially given the
high rate of utilization in the labor market.

2007-03-20,15,"(15) The lower portion of Chart 7 reports near-term prescriptions of simple
policy rules embedding an inflation goal of either 1½ or 2 percent.  The rule proposed
by Taylor (1999) calls for a funds rate of about 4½ to 5 percent for the current
quarter, whereas a funds rate of about 5½ percent is stipulated by a variant of that
rule incorporating a higher value of r*.  In each of these cases, the rule is consistent
with a downward-sloping path of the federal funds rate going forward, with a cut
next quarter of about 25 basis points.  In contrast to the Taylor rules, the first-
difference rulewhich does not require estimates of the levels of the output gap
or the equilibrium real interest rateprescribes setting the nominal federal funds
rate at about 5½ percent if the inflation goal is 1½ percent or at about 5 percent if
the inflation goal is 2 percent.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 41
Inflation Expectations and Optimal Control Policies1
For an inflation goal of 1½ percent, the optimal control policy  
shown in Chart 6 is associated with glacial convergence of actual 
inflation toward the goal.  This feature does not primarily reflect  
the specification of short-run wage and price dynamics in the 
FRB/US model, but rather the slow adjustment of the long-run 
inflation expectations of wage and price setters.  Those agents 
expectationswhich are determined by their understanding of the 
inflation goal specified by policymakersdecline from a current  
level of around 2 percent toward the true goal at a pace calibrated  
to approximate the empirical behavior of survey measures of  
long-run inflation expectations.  To highlight the role of this  
aspect of inflation expectations in shaping optimal policy, this  
box compares the benchmark specification with two alternative 
assumptions regarding the evolution of public perceptions of 
policymakers inflation goal. 
 
In the benchmark specification of the FRB/US model (the solid line  
in each panel to the right), it is assumed that wage and price setters 
gradually update their beliefs about the inflation goal in response to 
actual inflation outcomes.  As a result, policymakers need to tighten 
policy substantially in order to elevate the unemployment rate and 
generate sufficient downward pressure on actual inflation.  In this 
scenario, long-run inflation expectations (not shown) decline by 
only about ¼ percentage point through 2012.  
 
In contrast, in the case of immediate recognition, wage and price setters 
are assumed to perceive the 1½ percent inflation goal starting in  
the current quarter (dashed red lines).  In this scenario, core inflation 
declines rapidly and approaches the goal by the end of 2008, while  
the unemployment rate remains close to its natural rate over the  
next few years.2  
 
In the final scenariolearning from policy actionswage and price  
setters infer the inflation goal from surprises in policymakers 
setting of the federal funds rate (dotted blue lines).  In this case, 
policymakers signal their commitment to a disinflation through  
a substantial initial increase in the funds rate, which pushes the 
unemployment rate about ¼ percentage point above its natural rate  
later this decade.  As a result, long-run inflation expectations  
decline more rapidly than in the benchmark specification, and  
core inflation converges to the 1½ percent goal by 2012.  ______________________________

2 In principle, the speed of disinflation could be influenced by the baseline 
assumption that agents do not form model-consistent expectations but 
instead generate forecasts based on a small-scale VAR. However, the memo 
reports roughly identical simulation paths under these two alternative 
approaches, conditional on the same credibility of monetary policy.

a move, as it becomes evident to the market, could tend to moderate or
even reverse the developing tendency of recent days for some interest

With investment yields on Treasury bills and other short-term market
instruments continuing at levels that make large negotiable CD's non-
competitive, no net growth in these instruments is projected, although
it is expected that enough new CD's can be issued outside New York City
to offset continuing run-offs at the major banks. Growth in consumer-
type time and savings deposits is likely to slow appreciably in July,
during the mid-year reinvestment period. Thereafter, growth of such
accounts should pick up appreciably as in other recent quarters,
returning total time deposit expansion to about a 10-1/2 per cent
annual rate in September. The pattern of growth in the credit proxy is
strongly influenced by the projected path of time deposit expansion and
assumes a steady growth in nondeposit sources of funds at $100 million
a week. If commercial paper issuers should move back into banks in
volume, growth in the proxy, of course, could be larger,with bank financing
presumably coming from non-deposit sources (or perhaps from increased

rates will decline somewhat further, though maintenance of a Federal funds

possible use if the Committee decides to call for maintenance of prevail-
ing money market conditions, subject to a proviso clause.
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the committee seeks to

financing, developments in capital markets, and uncertain-
ties in foreign exchange markets.] System open market

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the
money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as a
description of ""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso
clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connec-
tion with alternative A as the ""expected"" paths. The proviso clause
has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against significant
excesses but not shortfalls, on the assumption that the Committee would
not want money market conditions to be eased in the coming period if the
aggregates should fall short of the indicated paths. As will be noted,
the proposed proviso retains the sense of the reference to capital
market developments in the present directive (i.e., to take account of
such developments in any firming operations) by indicating that somewhat
firmer conditions are to be sought under the proviso only ""if capital
markets are not under excessive pressure.""

1971-07-27,16,"(16) The slowing of growth in M1 and accompanying reserve
developments under alternative A would not be expected to lead to higher
interest rates in either short- or long-term markets, at least in the
immediate future. For one thing, growth in the demand for money is likely
to be abating. Also the credit demands of corporations and State and local
governments in bond markets are expected to continue around the somewhat
more moderate dimensions of the past month or two, and thereby take some
rate pressure off long-term markets. In addition, Treasury cash borrowing
demands during the third quarter are turning out to be somewhat less than
expected in view of the low level at which the Treasury is running its cash
balance. In the fourth quarter, however, Treasury cash borrowing is expected
to be substantial.
","alternative A"
1971-08-24,16,"(16) While the market probably has already discounted some re-
duction in the Federal funds rate, sizable downward movement--say, to the
lower end of the range specified in alternative B--would undoubtedly be
interpreted by the market as a significant policy move. This would encourage
further yield declines in both short- and long-term markets. It is possible
that such a move could carry rates to unsustainably low levels, but, on the
other hand, it is still unclear whether the decline in market yields to date
has fully discounted the changed outlook on inflation.
","alternative B"
1971-09-21,16,"(16) Alternative C. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides to seek somewhat more rapid growth rates
in the aggregates than called for under alternative A. The money market
and reserve conditions believed likely to prove consistent with those
growth rates are noted in paragraph (8).
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
PROMOTE [DEL: achieve more] moderate growth in monetary and credit
aggregates over the months ahead. System open market opera-
tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con-
ducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market
conditions consistent with that objective.""
This directive does not include the phrase ""taking account of developments
in capital markets"" since the prompt and substantial easing of the money
market contemplated is likely to minimize the risk of adverse capital
market developments, particularly in a period when the monetary aggregates
are weak.

1971-11-16,16,"(16) Assuming the tight end of the money market range for
alternative A/B, it is possible that the technical position of markets
will lead to an increase in interest rates over the near-term despite
the recent discount rate reduction. Factors that may put bill rates
under upward pressure have been noted in paragraph (10). In longer-
term markets, dealer and syndicate positions are large in the wake of
the recent Treasury financings and the sizable volume of municipal and
corporate bond offerings; and uncertainties as to the viability of the
announced wage-price program could result in nervous holders pressing
their inventories on the market. An easing on the money market toward
the lower end of the alternative A/B range would likely offset such a
tendency should it arise. And if the money market moved into the
alternative C range, the whole market would likely adjust downward in
yield, impelled in part by expectations of a further decline in the
discount rate.
Possible directive language
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative C"
1971-12-14,16,"(16) In long-term credit markets, fundamental forces working to hold
interest rates down appear strongest in the corporate and mortgage markets.
The corporate calendar appears to be moderating, and in the mortgage market
credit availability appears ample relative to demand. Even under alternative A,
interest rates in these two markets might not show any significant rise. The
rather large forward calendar of municipal issues and still sizable dealer
holdings of U.S. Government coupon issues make these two markets particularly
sensitive to any reversal of the easing trend in the money market. On the other
hand, if this easing trend were to be extended further, all bond markets
would certainly strengthen.
","alternative A"
1972-02-15,16,"(16) If the Committee were to adopt alternative B it could base
reserve operating targets on the levels and growth rates for reserves shown
earlier to be consistent with either patterns I, II, or III. The Committee
may also wish to allow, in operations, for the effects on reserve levels of
unanticipated changes in U.S. Government deposits, net interbank deposits,
and perhaps large CD's. The effect of anticipated changes in such deposits
was discussed in paragraph (11).
","alternative B"
1972-04-18,16,"(16) Alternative C. This language differs from that of alternative
A in the inclusion of the word ""more"" before ""moderate growth in monetary
aggregates."" It is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to
pursue the more restrictive course contemplated by the specifications given
earlier for pattern II.
""To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: international developments and possible] THE FORTHCOMING
Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank
reserve and money market conditions that will support
MORE moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the
months ahead.""
BACKGROUND TO TECHNICAL CORRECTION OF RPD PATH
The correction affects the measured distribution of reserves held
behind private nonbank demand deposits (RPD) and net interbank deposits. The
target after correction represents what the staff would have presented at the
time of the March 21 FOMC meeting as consistant with pattern II aggregates if
the timing and extent to which foreign banking institutions were moving onto
PEPS had been known. The change in effect reduces the multiplier between
available reserves for private nonbank deposits and currently measured M 1.
The correction was necessary because of the accounting effect of the
recent transfer (on February 7 and March 13) to the PEPS system for clearing
international transactions of several foreign banking institutions which had
not yet been incorporated into our banking statistics. The staff did not
know the magnitude and exact timing of this transfer at the time of the
last FOMC meeting. As these foreign institutions joined PEPS, the effect
was to lower both cash items and net interbank deposits on the books of
member banks. In staff calculations of the distribution of reserves, this
would mean that reserves against net interbank deposits would decline and
required reserves against private demand deposits at member banks (gross demand
deposits less the now lower cash items) would rise by an equivalent amount,
thereby increasing the measured reserves available series. As noted above,
if the timing and extent of transfer had been known at the time of the last
FOMC meeting, the staff would have allowed for the effect in construction of
the reserve path presented at that meeting.
Incorporation of these institutions into the banking statistics
will, when we make our next annual revision, raise the measured level of the
money supply (unless offset, of course, by other benchmark changes). But the
data for the institutions that we have gathered indicates that there will be
virtually no effect on rates of change in money supply. In the annual
revision, a gradually decreasing level will be carried back over a number
of years.

introduction of the new PEPS system for clearing international transfers. These corrections, worked out in conjunction with the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, are purely technical. The adjusted target represents what the staff would have presented at the time of the March 21 FOMC
meeting as consistent with Pattern II aggregates and money market conditions if the timing and extent to which foreign banking institutions were
moving onto PEPS had been known. The amount of correction is plus 1-1/2 percentage points at an annual rate for the March-April period. Thus,
the adjusted target indicates a 12-1/2 percent annual rate (mid-point of the range) for the two-month period, as compared with 11 percent in the
original target.

1972-05-23,16,"(16) Possible language for the operational paragraph of the
directive is given below. The three alternative adjectives qualifying
""growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead"" might be taken to
correspond with the similarly lettered patterns of aggregate growth
rates described in the preceding section.
""To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of
capital market developments and the forthcoming Treasury
financing,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
(A - MODERATE )
money market conditions that will support (B - somewhat more moderate)

Deletion of the reference to capital market developments is proposed in
light of the recent and prospective moderation of credit demands in secur-
ities markets. The Committee may wish, however, to consider including the
capital markets reference--particularly under alternative C and possibly
B--in view of the possibility under these alternatives that strong upward
rate pressures could develop in longer-term markets.
Revised RPD Data
On May 18, the RPD series was released to the public; the series
will now appear weekly in two Board statistical releases and monthly in the
Bulletin. Weekly and monthly data are available back through 1960. The
published seasonally adjusted series differs somewhat from the previously
available internal figures as a result of technical adjustments undertaken in
the course of a thorough methodological review.
While, as before, seasonally adjusted RPD is based on seasonally
adjusted deposit aggregates, two technical adjustments were made to the data.
First, required reserve ratios were aggregated from micro data in order to adjust
ratios for the distribution of deposits below and above $5 million at each
bank, reflecting differences in reserve requirements. This changed the level
of the RPD series by about $30 million on average. Second, required reserves
for private demand and total time and savings deposits were calculated directly. 1/
In the old series, required reserves for net interbank and Treasury deposits
had been subtracted from total reserves to calculate RPD. 2/ This different
method of calculation reduced the level of RPD by about $350 million on
As indicated in the first three columns of the table on the next
page, the level of the new series is lower than for the old series.

","Alternative C"
1972-08-15,16,"(16) Under alternative A, interest rates in longer-term markets
would probably remain relatively stable until late in the year. It is
likely that corporations, with relatively high liquidity and increased
emphasis on equity financing, private placements, and short-term borrowing,
will continue their relatively moderate pace of bond offerings, and
that State and local borrowings will remain below last year's high
Mortgage demands are expected to moderate in any event, both seasonally
and in line with the decline in housing starts. However, the increases
in money market rates associated with alternative B could produce an
earlier advance in long-term rates, and under alternative C the upward
movement in long rates would undoubtedly be both large and prompt. In
the latter circumstances investors would tend to withdraw from the market
to await anticipated higher yields and issuers could be expected to
accelerate offerings now planned for 1973. The tax-exempt market would
be adversely affected by reduced bank purchases, and the impact on the
mortgage market could be quite substantial as institutional lenders began
to experience a slowing of savings inflows in the context of a record volume
of outstanding commitments.
Proposed directives
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative C"
1973-01-16,16,"(15) Efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates
of alternative C are likely to entail an even greater firming of money
market conditions, with the Federal funds rate probably moving well
above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting. The 3-month bill
rate would likely rise into the 5-3/4--6 per cent area, if not by the
time of the next meeting then by early March when additional cash borrowing
through tax bill offerings may be anticipated. If short-term rates attain
these levels, there may be a rather marked dampening in flows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits, which could eventually call into question
the viability of current Regulation Q ceilings on such deposits.
(16) If the Committee were to opt to restrain growth in
reserves and monetary aggregates with the result that money market
conditions firmed, even-keel considerations would again be a constraint
on the timing of policy actions. Sufficient time has been given for
distribution of the recent long-term bond offering so that it no longer
appears to require special consideration. However, on January 31 the
Treasury will announce terms for refunding $4.8 billion of publicly-held
obligations that mature in mid-February. It is too early to have an
idea as to the nature of the refunding, although it does seem unlikely
at this point that new cash will need to be raised or that the Treasury
will wish to offer another long bond so close to the recent offering.
Thus, a relatively conventional exchange with short- and intermediate-term
options seems most likely.
","alternative C"
1973-05-15,16,"(16) Under alternative C, which moves toward a lower long-run
growth rate for the aggregates, it would appear that the Federal funds
rate would probably have to rise above 8 per cent over the period imme-
diately ahead. Because of lags the main impact on M1 growth would not
occur until the third quarter, when--to achieve the 4--4-1/2 per cent
long-run objective--M1 growth would have to fall to a 3 per cent annual
rate. M2 growth also would slow sharply, given the significantly higher
short-term rates and assuming no increase in Regulation Q ceilings for
consumer-type time deposits. Given the low growth rates for the aggre-
gates expected for the third quarter under this alternative, the Committee may
find it necessary to ease money market conditions in the course of summer
if it desires to stay on the longer-run growth paths of alternative C
Proposed directive
","alternative C, alternative C"
1973-06-18,16,"(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the reference
to international developments because the speculative pressures in exchange
markets since shortly before the last meeting have not caused special
operating problems for the Desk. Retention of the reference to domestic
financial market developments is proposed in both alternatives B and C,
because both involve the possibility of a significant tightening of the
money market. As will be noted, both alternatives B and C refer to the
aggregate growth rates ""indicated for the first half of the year."" Including
current estimates for June, these are as follows: M1, 5.5 per cent;
M2, 7.5 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 13.5 per cent.

1973-08-21,16,"(16) Looking to all three money concepts, by the fourth quarter M1
is indicated to be expanding at a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate under alternative B,
while M2 and M3 growth is expected to be around 5-1/2 and 6 per cent,
respectively. For M2 and M3, these would be lowest quarterly growth rates
since early 1970.
","alternative B"
1973-11-19,16,"(16) In long-term markets, a relatively large volume of new
corporate and state and local government bond issues are expected to be
offered between now and the mid-December holiday lull. As a result, bond
yields may come under some upward pressure under alternative B, upward
rate pressure would be considerably greater under alternative C. The
energy crisis could augment upward rate pressures by increasing inflationary
expectations and/or by stimulating anticipations of additional real
capital investment.
Proposed directive
","alternative B, alternative C"
1974-05-21,16,"(16) With the money market conditions assumed under alternative
A, the staff would expect M1 growth in May-June to be in a 5-7 per cent
range. The mid-point of this range, if attained, would produce a 6¾ per
cent annual growth rate in the second quarter. Growth would be expected
to slow somewhat in the third quarter to about a 5¾ per cent rate, as
demand for money is further restrained by lagged impacts of the sharp
rise in short-term interest rates over the past few months.

1974-06-18,16,"(16) In the event that the Committee again wishes to couch
the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market
conditions, the specifications of alternative B might be associated

namely, that ""...the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-02-19,16,"(16) Under alternative C, the funds rate would be expected
to decline to around 6 per cent--the mid-point of the range shown
in paragraph (7)--or a little below, between now and the next Committee
meeting. Such a decline is probably not much more than the market has
already discounted. As a result, interest rates may decline little
further over the next few weeks under this alternative. Moreover,
the weight of Treasury financings could place upward pressure on the
rate structure rather soon.
","alternative C"
1975-03-18,16,"(16) Turning to the behavior of M1 in the March-April period,
expansion is indicated to be in a 4½-6½ per cent range, given prevailing
money market conditions (typified by a 5¾ per cent funds rate) as called
for by alternative B. Near-term growth, of course, would be somewhat more
rapid under the easier money market conditions of alternative A and some-
what less rapid under the tighter conditions of alternative C. Money growth
rates, in general, are expected to accelerate by early summer when tax
rebates are added to the public's cash and time deposit holdings (assuming
prompt passage of a tax reduction bill). And, as noted earlier, trans-
actions demands for cash balances are likely to intensify in summer as
GNP strengthens. We would expect that the acceleration in money growth
would be relatively modest under alternative C, however, since rising
interest rates would be working to restrain money demand.
Proposed directive
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C, alternative C"
1975-04-14,16,"(16) The roughly 1 percentage point rise in the Federal funds
rate over the next few weeks contemplated under alternative C would
probably cause other short-term rates to rise by even larger amounts, at
least temporarily, mainly because of expectational effects on markets in
a period of heavy Treasury financings and with near-term prospects of
economic recovery. Longer-term rate increases could be substantial, if
borrowers tended to accelerate offerings under the circumstances in
anticipation of even higher rates later. On the other hand, pressures
on bond markets could be moderated if corporate borrowers begin to
utilize bank lines so as to avoid being locked into relatively high
interest costs. Lower growth rates in all of the monetary aggregates
would be expected. Banks and thrift institutions may begin to experience
a significantly slower inflow of consumer-type time and savings deposits,
and the bank prime loan rate and mortgage market rates would probably
show significant increases.
Proposed directive
","alternative C"
1975-05-20,16,"(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to
delete the reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-May
financing has been completed. As will be noted, alternatives A and B
refer to growth in monetary aggregates ""on average in recent months.""
Over the first 4 months of this year, growth rates (using revised data)
were 2.9, 8.3, and 10.8 per cent for M1, M2, and M3 , respectively.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the forth
coming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic and
international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: somewhat]
more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead
than has occurred on average in recent months.
Alternative B

coming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic and
international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve

coming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and inter-
national financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-06-16,16,"(16) Alternative C contemplates more tightening in money
market conditions over the near-term--with the funds rate range centered
on 6 per cent--than under alternative B. Such an approach appears
compatible with longer-run growth objectives that include holding
growth in M1 over the next year in the 4-6 per cent annual rate range,
as shown in the table in paragraph (7). Under this alternative, growth
in M1 over the March '75-March '76 period would be at the mid-point of
the 5-7 per cent long-run range earlier adopted by the Committee. But
this alternative implies enough further tightening in the money market
so that growth in the monetary aggregates would be below the bottom
of the 5-7 per cent range for M 1 in the first half of 1976.
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1975-07-15,16,"(16) Under all three alternatives net inflows of time and
savings deposits (other than large money market CD's) to banks and to
thrift institutions are expected to slow from their recent unusually
rapid pace that included the effects on savings of tax rebates and
one-time social security payments. The slowdown would be greatest over
the near-term under alternative C, which involves the probability of a
significant further rise in short-term market interest rates. Never-
theless, net inflows of consumer-type time deposits are still likely to
be good-sized during the summer. Later this fall reduced inflows might
be expected to exert more pronounced pressures on banks to raise
additional funds in the CD market and on thrift institutions to borrow
from Home Loan Banks and commercial banks under either alternatives B
or C.
Proposed directive
","alternative C"
1975-09-16,16,"(16) Under alternative C mortgage market conditions may be
expected to tighten rather promptly, with rates rising further over the
next few weeks and with lenders becoming less willing to make loan
commitments. Under alternative A, and to a certain extent under
alternative B (to be discussed below), strains on the mortgage
market would be more delayed and less severe. The assumed adjustment
in Regulation Q ceilings would temper the impact of upward market rate
adjustments on savings inflows to thrift institutions after year-end,
but the mortgage market would still be expected to come under additional
pressure next year.
","alternative C, alternative A, alternative B"
1975-10-21,16,"(16) Alternative C involves a Federal funds rate range over the
next four weeks centered on 6 per cent. This would return the rate to where
it was at about the time of the previous Committee meeting. Such an immediate
rise in the funds rate appears most consistent with adoption by the Committee
of lower longer-run rates of growth in the monetary aggregates,
indexed by M1 expansion over the year ahead in a 4-6½
per cent range. Also such a rise in the funds rate would not be inconsistent
with the longer-run growth rates of alternative B. An immediate increase in
the funds rate would retard money growth over the near term, but would imply
somewhat less of a rise in the Federal funds rate over the next year than
shown for alternative B in appendix Table IV.
","Alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1976-06-22,16,"(16) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank
reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on
the specific conditions sought. Three alternative ""money market"" direc-
tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
are given below.
Alternative ""Money Market"" Proposals
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market condi-
tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the
period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR
TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market
conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates]
over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES
APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market condi-
tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the
period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO
BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1976-10-19,16,"(16) Alternative A encompasses an easing of the money market
between now and the next Committee meeting. Such an approach seems most
consistent with an effort to raise longer-run growth rates from those cur-
rently in place. The contemplated 1/2 point reduction in the Federal funds
rate in the near-term would lead to a significant decline in market rates--
and also probably in the prime loan and primary mortgage rates--over the
next few weeks. There would be some further increase in net inflows of
interest-bearing deposits at banks and thrift institutions. As such
inflows continued, and as market rates declined, it is likely that earn-
ings experience would place these institutions under some pressure to
reduce interest rates offered on deposits. However, no substantial
reductions would be likely over the next few weeks.
Proposed directive
","Alternative A"
1977-02-15,16,"(16) With monetary growth rates more rapid over the next
few months than under the alternatives discussed above, alternative A
would imply more restraint later in the year if growth in the aggregates
is to be constrained within current longer-run ranges. A funds rate of
around 6¾ per cent is expected by the end of 1977 under this alternative.
Proposed directive
","alternative A"
1977-04-19,16,"(16) The lower interest rates associated with this alternative
over the next few weeks are not likely to prove sustainable, however. In
view of the apparent strength of the economy, interest rates may be
expected to rise even with the more rapid longer-run growth in the
monetary aggregates encompassed by alternative A. The increase in rates
would probably be moderate, though, with the funds rate rising to about
","alternative A"
1977-07-19,16,"(16) The rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks
accompanying short-run alternative C (or D) would probably carry the 3-month
Treasury bill rate above the 5¼ per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution
savings deposits. This may trigger an increased diversion of these deposits
to market instruments. Under alternative C we would expect that thrifts
would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near
the recent pace. In addition, given the substantial mortgage takedowns
in train, these institutions would have to draw down their liquid assets
and borrow more heavily from the FHL Banks; the need for secondary mortgage
market support by FNMA would also increase. But the rise in mortgage rates
may be limited if insurance companies, for example, become more active
in the mortgage market as a result of the continuing favorable spread of
mortgage rates over corporate bond yields. In any event, upward pressures
on corporate and tax exempt bond yields are likely to be relatively modest,
given the substantial supply of investible funds at insurance companies and
other institutional investors.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1977-08-16,16,"(16) The further rise in the funds rate of ½ percentage point
over the next few weeks contemplated under alternative C would likely
lead to increases of comparable magnitude in short-term rates generally.
Upward rate pressures would probably also be communicated to the inter-
mediate-term market, where the Treasury is expected to raise $2-$3 billion
of new cash through routine offerings of 2- and 4-year notes during the
next few weeks, though they may be moderate in view of the market's strong
technical position. Longer-term rates, too, might increase somewhat, but
any such increases might not be long sustained if the market came to
believe that the process of tightening was near an end or that the
process would work to restrain inflation.
","alternative C"
1977-11-15,16,"(16) An easing in the funds rate to the mid-point of a 5¾ to
stantial downward adjustments in interest rates. Such rate movements, how-
ever, would probably be short-lived, since the added impetus to growth in
the monetary aggregates would soon require a sharp reversal in interest
rates in order to constrain the aggregates to the Committee's longer-run
ranges. With M-1 likely to expand at about a 7 per cent average annual
rate over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 under
this alternative, interest rates would have to rise sufficiently to hold
M-1 growth in the second and third quarters of 1978 to a 3½ per cent
annual rate. The projected Federal funds pattern for this alternative
calls, therefore, for sustained increases to around 8¼ per cent in the third
quarter of 1978. Under such circumstances, some adjustment in Regulation Q
ceilings may have to be considered by next summer.
Directive language
","alternative
c"
1977-12-19,16,"(16) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range between now
and mid-January. With additional monetary restraint in place sooner,
the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to be some-
what slower over the next few months than under alternative B. Con-
sequently, interest rates would have to rise somewhat less next year
in order to achieve the mid-points of the Committee's longer-run ranges
for the QIII '77-QIII '78 period.
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1978-03-21,16,"(16) An easing of the Federal funds rate to around 6¼
per cent, as contemplated under alternative A, would be very
surprising to the market in light of the weakness of the dollar
in foreign exchange markets and recent indications of acceleration in
the rise of wholesale and retail prices. In addition, if staff pro-
jections are correct, such an easing action would be taking place
in conjunction with publication of accelerated growth in M-1. Short-
term market rates would decline, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate
possibly falling below 6 per cent. The value of the dollar would
probably decline in international exchange markets. Long-term interest
rates would probably decline little, since market participants would
likely view such an action as temporary. Indeed, as noted earlier,
interest rates would soon need to begin rising in order to restrain
growth in the aggregates to the mid-point of their longer-run ranges,
and by autumn would have to reach levels higher than under alternatives
B and C.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1978-08-15,16,"(16) The language of alternative B is consistent with the
specifications of the tightening alternative discussed in the preced-
ing section; it calls for operations directed initially at attaining
a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly or somewhat above the
current level. This formulation also provides variants that enable
the Committee to place main emphasis either on money market conditions
or on monetary aggregates.
In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the
longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while
giving due regard to developing conditions in financial markets
more generally. During the period until the next regular meet-
ing, System open market operations shall be directed

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above

","alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B"
1978-09-19,16,"(16) Under either alternative A or B, short-term interest
rates are expected to come under further upward pressure before year-
end. With nominal GNP projected to rise at an annual rate of more than
funds rate might have to rise to 9 to 9-1/4 per cent during the fourth
quarter if growth in M-1 is to be constrained to around the upper limit
market interest rates and the anticipated completion of the stock adjust-
ment to the new 6-month certificates is expected to slow the pace of
inflows into interest-bearing deposits subject to regulatory ceilings,
and growth in both M-2 and M-3 over the QII '78 to QII '79 policy period
is projected to be in the upper half of their longer-run ranges.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1978-11-21,16,"(16) Appendix I shows the expected Federal funds rate
ranges over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period. In view of the
monetary restraint already in train, the midpoint of the alternative
A path would call for no further increase in the funds rate over this
period. The alternative B pattern contemplates that the increase
in the funds rate in the intermeeting period would be maintained
through the first quarter of 1979. This additional restraint on
monetary expansion implies that the funds rate could be lower than
the alternative A path by next summer while still achieving the
same growth in the aggregates over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.
Directive language
","alternative
A, alternative B, alternative A"
1978-12-19,16,"(16) If the Federal funds rate remains within the 9¾ to 10
per cent range over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under
alternative A, interest rates on short-term market instruments will
likely fluctuate within a narrow range. Private short-term rates
appear to have fully adjusted to the current funds rate level, and
no significant change in private short-term credit demands appears in
prospect for the weeks immediately ahead. The relative movement of
Treasury bill rates will, of course, be influenced by the level of
foreign exchange market intervention and the portfolio policies of
foreign official institutions.
","alternative A"
1979-02-06,16,"(16) In considering short-run alternatives, the FOMC may
wish to take into account the growth rates for the aggregates from
the estimated January levels that would be required to reach levels
in March and June that are implied by the longer-run ranges. The
table on page 14 provides such information for longer-run alternative B.2/
As shown by the middle column of the table, M-1 would have to grow
at a 8-1/4 per cent annual rate from January--and M-2 by a 10-1/4
per cent annual rate--to reach the level in March that is implied
by growth along the midpoint path of the longer-run QIV '78 - QIV '79
range. Growth for M-1 would have to be about 3 percentage points
lower to reach the low end of the alternative B range of growth,
and 3 points higher to reach the upper end. Over the five months
from January to June, M-1 would have to expand at a 5 per cent annual
rate and M-2 at a 7 per cent annual rate to reach midpoint paths.

1979-03-20,16,"(16) If, as projected, the monetary aggregates strengthen in
March-April, market expectations of a near-term tightening of monetary
policy may themselves lead to some upward pressures on short-term interest
rates. In addition, the Treasury market may have to absorb further bill
sales by foreign accounts, and the Treasury may have to offer a sizable
amount of cash management bills to cover cash drains prior to the mid-
April tax date. Rate pressures could be intensified if banks increase
the pace of their CD offerings, which they might well do if bank
credit demands remain strong, availability of corporate RP money declines
as the April tax date approaches, or the return flow of funds from their
branches abroad diminishes. Any tendency for short-term rates to rise,
however, would be blunted by stability of the funds rate at near current
levels, as contemplated under alternative B. The dollar may well continue
to trade around current levels in the exchange markets over the next few
weeks, accompanied by continuation of some central bank net sales of
","alternative B"
1979-04-17,16,"(16) The staff would expect that maintenance of the Federal
funds rate at about 10 per cent over the remainder of the year would be
consistent with M-1 growth for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 policy period at
about the midpoint of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ per cent range.- A near-
term increase in the funds rate,as under alternative C,likely would
necessitate some decline of interest rates in the second half of the
year in order to induce strength in the aggregates as the rate of
growth of nominal GNP decelerates further. Under alternative A, however,
we would expect interest rates to rise later in the year to offset the
stimulative effect on the aggregates of the near-term easing of money market
conditions, if M-1 growth over the longer-run policy period is to be near
the midpoint of its 1½ to 4 per cent range.
Directive language
","alternative C, alternative A"
1979-05-22,16,"(16) Alternative C contemplates a rise in the Federal funds
rate to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and
M-2 would likely be in an annual rate range of 0 to 4 and 3 to 7 per
cent, respectively. Short-term interest rates would increase as the funds
rate rises. Treasury bill rates could come under particular upward
pressure if the dollar strengthens on exchange markets and foreign
central banks in consequence engage in substantial support operations.
In the short-run, long-term rates would also likely rise; however, such
increases might be moderated if the market came to believe that a tightening
action now will hasten the ultimate peak in interest rates.
","Alternative C"
1979-08-14,16,"(16) As noted in paragraph (9), the staff currently expects
that the public's demand for M-1 will be significantly weaker over the
remainder of the year than it has been in recent months. Given the out-
look for nominal GNP, and assuming that the Committee adopts short-run
alternative B, the projected behavior of money demand would permit a
decline in the Federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent by year-end with
M-1 growth for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period ending up close to the mid-
point of the longer-run range (of 3 to 6 percent, assuming 1-1/2 percent
ATS adjustment). However, should the public's demand for M-1 not exhibit
the anticipated weakening, M-1 growth might be well into the upper half
of the longer-run range even if the funds rate were held at its current
Directive language
","alternative B"
1979-09-18,16,"(16) Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal funds rate
to the midpoint of an 11½ to 12¼ percent range and would tend to exert
more restraint on the monetary aggregates over the months ahead than
alternative B. While some tightening in the System's funds rate objective
may still be built into the current level of rates, a rise in the funds rate
of the dimensions contemplated by alternative C would be expected to trigger
further increasesin market rates. Such interest rate adjustments would
likely be associated with a modest strengthening of the dollar in foreign
exchange markets. Domestically, a further rise in the funds rate might
prompt thrift institutions to make vigorous efforts to reduce outstanding
mortgage commitments, which are now high relative to cash flows. Pressures
on banks would be increased not only as their cost of funds rose but also
as businesses shifted even more borrowing to short-term maturities in
anticipation that a cyclical peak in rates was being approached.
Directive language
","Alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1979-11-20,16,"(16) Pressures on thrift institutions are unlikely to ease over
the next few weeks under alternative B. However, if the funds rate drops
a little, and corporate bond yields do decline, mortgage rates could edge
off. A stabilized market atmosphere would make thrift institutions less
hesitant to commit funds to the mortgage market. It is not likely,
though, that mortgage market conditions will improve markedly unless
short-term market rates drop significantly and/or adjustments favorable
to thrift institutions are made in deposit ceiling rates.
","alternative B"
1980-02-04,16,"(16) Given a GNP projection in which the economy is not as weak
as earlier anticipated, alternative B may be accompanied by little change
in the funds rate over the next few weeks. Under such circumstances, there
may be little if any reduction in the demand for borrowing under alternative
B from around the $1¼ billion average level of January. On that assumption,
nonborrowed reserves, like total reserves, would change little from
January to March.
","alternative B, alternative
B"
1980-03-18,16,"(16) Compared to the other alternatives, alternative A involves
a greater increase in money over the four months ending in June, with
M-1A targeted to expand at a 3¾ percent rate over that period. The monetary
base and total reserves might expand at annual rates of 8 and 6 percent,
respectively. As shown in the charts, the more rapid rates of growth of
aggregates anticipated under alternative A would carry them to levels in
June above their midpoint paths. The somewhat greater reserve supply would
tend to be associated with some downward pressure on money market rates.
The federal funds rate possibly would decline to about the 15 to 15 per-
cent area over the next few weeks, with an associated member bank borrowing
of around $1¾ billion. Nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 6½
percent annual rate in the February to June period.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1980-04-22,16,"(16) As shown in the charts, alternative C implies that all of
the monetary aggregates would be below their midpoint paths by June. In
order to achieve the midpoint of the longer-run aggregates growth ranges
for all of 1980, the Committee would therefore have to adopt a policy in
the second half of the year designed to accelerate money growth somewhat.
Such a policy would add to the downward interest rate pressures likely to
occur in any event in reflection of the sharp reduction in real GNP that the
staff is projecting. The staff anticipates, for example, a federal funds
rate of around 13 to 14 percent for late 1980 under alternative B, and this
rate would have to be lower under alternative C.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1980-05-20,16,"(16) Alternative B contemplates a more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates than alternative A over the short run--for example, an 8 per-
cent annual rate of growth in M-1A over the May-June period--in the process
of reaching the Committee's longer-run path by September (rather than by
December as in alternative A). Such an approach involves a greater likeli-
hood that interest rates, particularly short-term rates, will decline further
over the weeks ahead. The proposed federal funds rate range for this
alternative is 9 to 14 percent.
","Alternative B, alternative A, alternative A"
1980-07-09,16,"(16) Alternatives A and B are consistent with longer-run
alternative I and are indexed by M-1A growth of 4½ percent from QIV '79
to QIV '80. Alternative A assumes that such a 4½ percent growth line is
reached relatively soon-by September; it therefore would also assume a
slowdown in M-1A growth to 4½ percent after September. Alternative B
targets a more gradual rebound in M-1A from the first half pace. It
assumes an 8¼ percent M-1A growth rate for June-September which, if
continued through December, will yield growth of 4½ percent over the year.
Alternative C is based on a slower long-run growth of M-A of 3 percent
from QIV '79 to QIV '80, which would be more consistent with longer-run

June to September, and growth would need to continue at that rate in the
fourth quarter.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, alternative B, alternative C"
1980-12-18,16,"(16) Under alternative B, actual M-A growth may be slightly
negative after the turn of the year, on the assumption that the NOW account
effect reduces M-1A growth by about 5½ percentage points over the first
three months of the year. Measured M-1B growth may be around 7½ percent in
the early months of next year on the assumption that shifts out of assets
not contained in M-1B raise growth of that aggregate by about 2 percentage
points. To achieve the monetary expansion indicated by alternative B,
total reserves would have to increase at about a 1¾ percent annual rate
from November to March, and by 3 percent over the shorter-run period from
November to January.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1981-02-02,16,"(16) All of the alternatives imply a substantial slowing in
growth of the transactions-related aggregates on a quarterly average basis
in the first three months of 1981. For example, implied quarterly average
growth in M-1B ranges from a high of 3¾ percent under alternative A to a low
of 2 percent under alternative C. This suggests substantial monetary
restraint against a projected expansion in nominal GNP for the quarter at an
annual rate of more than 13 percent. The sizable implied velocity increases
would indicate little room for further short-term interest rate declines.
Under alternative A, rates might be near, or perhaps a bit below, current
levels over the balance of the quarter. Alternative B might involve somewhat
higher interest rates, while alternative C seems quite likely to entail an
increase in interest rates over the balance of the quarter. Of course,
great uncertainty attaches to these interest rate projections, with market
reaction to the forthcoming economic program of the new Administration
likely to be a critical factor in near-term rate movements.
","alternative A, alternative C, alternative A, Alternative B, alternative C"
1981-10-05,16,"(17) M2 under this alternative would probably grow at a 12
percent annual rate over the next three months. Net inflows of funds to
thrift institutions may pick up somewhat, but more importantly, pressures on
their earnings would be greatly alleviated. Both mortgage market rates and
bond yields are likely to show a substantial drop, calling forth stronger
demands for longer-term financing. In exchange markets, the dollar would
probably weaken considerably. However, the declines in long-term rates
and exchange rates would tend to be moderated in the degree that market
participants came to believe that a substantial rebound of short-term
rates was in prospect over a reasonably near term. Such a rebound would
be expected by the staff early next year in the process of restraining money
growth to FOMC's 1982 targets. Such upward interest rate pressures would
be intensified as the sharp easing of credit conditions between now and
year-end contemplated by alternative A leads to more of a strengthening
in economic activity in the first part of next year than is in the current
staff projection.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1981-12-21,16,"(16) Alternative B calls for M1 growth from QIV '81 to March
at a 4 percent annual rate, but probably involves M2 growth slightly above
the upper end of its range. Growth of M1 from the estimated December level
to March would be at a slower 2¼ percent rate since the level of December is
high relative to the fourth quarter average. Growth of M2 over that period
would also be relatively moderate-at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate--for the
same reason.
","Alternative B"
1982-02-01,16,"(16) Alternative B calls for growth in Ml at about a 1 percent
annual rate over the two months January to March, a considerable decelera-
tion from the rapid pace of the previous three months. The staff believes
that such a slowing in narrow money growth is consistent with only rather
modest further upward pressure on interest rates, if any. Given the
staff's projection of nominal GNP growth during the current quarter at
only about a 2½ percent annual rate, the rapid increase in money that has
already occurred would appear quite sufficient to finance transactions
needs over the quarter, even assuming that a substantial part of the
increase represented precautionary balances. Indeed, even with virtually
no money growth over the balance of the quarter, the velocity of M1 would
decline in the quarter at a postwar record annual rate of about 9 percent.
","Alternative B"
1982-05-18,16,"(16) The Committee could simply reaffirm the directive adopted
at the previous meeting, since the behavior of the aggregates has not been
far off track and since many of the same problems of interpretation of
aggregate behavior remain. That directive is shown below. The language
would be most consistent with alternative B, although it also could be
adapted to alternatives A and C. If the Committee adopted alternative B,
it might wish to note that it has reaffirmed objectives adopted at the
last meeting (with possible language shown in brackets).
In the short run [,reaffirming its decision at the previous
meeting,] the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates con-
sistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June at annual
rates of about [DEL: 3] ____ percent and [DEL: 8] ____ percent respectively. The
Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be
evaluated in light of the probability that M2 would be less
affected over the period than M1 by deposit shifts related to the
tax date and by changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts
as a savings vehicle. Some shortfall in growth of M1, consistent
with progress toward the upper part of the range for the year as a
whole, would be acceptable in the context of appreciably reduced
pressures in the money market and relative strength of other
aggregates. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if
it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit
of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the
period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a
federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 12 to 16]
____ TO ____ percent.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1982-11-16,16,"(16) Alternative C involves M2 growth over the fourth quarter at
a 9 percent annual rate and constraint on reserve provision that would
probably lead to a federal funds rate of 10 percent or somewhat higher.
Total reserves would be expected to expand at a 5 percent annual rate over
the last two months of the year. With the discount rate unchanged at 9
percent, borrowings would likely be in the area of $600 million, and non-
borrowed reserves would rise at only a 1 percent annual rate.

1982-12-20,16,"(16) Total reserves might increase at a 9-1/2 percent annual
rate over the first three months of the year under alternative A and
nonborrowed reserves at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate, assuming adjustment
borrowing of around $100 million or so. The discount rate would come under
further downward pressure. The further easing in short-term markets con-
templated by this alternative may be associated with additional declines in
longer-term rates, particularly if signs of economic recovery remained
weak or scattered and if a revival of upward price and wage pressures was
not apparent. On the other hand, signs of an easing in reserve availability,
particularly against a backdrop of continued relatively rapid money growth,
might intensify inflationary concerns, exerting upward pressure on bond
","alternative A"
1983-03-28,16,"(16) Alternative A, which calls for 10 percent M2 growth from
March to June, would probably be associated with a drop in the federal
funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area. Adjustment borrowing of around
$150 to $200 million would be consistent with such a funds rate range if
the discount rate were cut to 8 percent. Or such a funds rate might
emerge, or be approached, if borrowing were dropped to the $50-100
million range at the current discount rate.
","Alternative A"
1983-05-24,16,"(16) The staff does not expect the bulge in M1 growth in May to
presage continued rapid growth in double digits in June or the months
beyond. Both our (refurbished) quarterly and monthly money demand models
would project expansion in a 6 to 7 percent annual rate area at around
current interest rates, given projected GNP. M1 growth in June seems
likely to be in that area, or perhaps lower considering the unwinding
of special influences that may be inflating growth in May--such as seasonal
adjustment problems and possible effects from an unusually sharp decline
in the Treasury balance after the first week of May. Given the moderate
June growth expected under alternative B, M1 on a quarterly average
basis would expand at about an 11 percent annual rate, which would imply
a 2 percent decline in its income velocity--a much smaller decline than
in the first quarter but still in sharp contrast to the increases that
have usually been registered in the early stages of business cycle upturns.
","alternative B"
1983-07-12,16,"(16) Strategies 3 and 4 depict alternative courses of events
depending on whether monetary policy is front-loaded or not. The earlier
imposition of restraint under strategy 3 appears to involve no less real
growth over the 4-year period than does the front-loading of ease under
strategy 4. However, strategy 3 entails a better price performance through-
out the period. Interest rates decline under this strategy after a
substantial further rise in the latter half of 1983 and by 1985 and 1986
are lower than under strategy 4. Of course, looking beyond 1986, a slowing
in monetary growth would be needed under strategy 3 to avoid a later
acceleration in price increases.
Policy alternatives for the short run
","alternative c"
1983-08-23,16,"(16) While growth in the monetary aggregates in the June-to-
September period may be only a little stronger under alternative A than
alternative B, the easing in bank reserve positions, if sustained through
the fourth quarter, would involve a greater chance as the year progresses
that M1 growth would accelerate, at least a bit, from what is currently
expected to be a moderate August pace and tend to stay above its longer-run
range. An acceleration could reflect both the reduced opportunity cost
of holding NOW accounts as well as any greater than projected expansion
in nominal GNP should an easing of interest rates lead, through a favor-
able impact on attitudes among other things, to greater consumer and
business spending. Growth in M2 and M3 would tend to be somewhat higher
for the year as money market conditions remain easier than under alter-
native B, but they are likely to remain within their longer-run ranges.
","alternative A, alternative B"
1983-11-14,16,"(16) Alternative A involves an easing in bank reserve positions
and money market conditions over the next few weeks--with borrowing from
the discount window falling into the $350-450 million range and the federal
funds rate dropping to around 8-3/4 to 9 percent. Growth of nonborrowed
reserves would likely average around 5 percent at an annual rate over
November and December.
","Alternative A"

involve little change in money market conditions over the intermeeting
period, would bring M2 growth to the middle of its alternative II range by

March, with M1 in the upper part of its range. M1 growth would be expected
to moderate in February and March from the relatively rapid average pace
of December and January, to about a 5 percent annual rate. On a quarterly
average basis, M1 expansion in the first quarter would be around 7-1/4 per-
cent, implying growth in velocity of around 2-1/2 percent, given projected
first-quarter nominal GNP growth. Such a velocity rise would be somewhat
less than in the fourth quarter--which was about 3-1/2 percent--and roughly
in line with predictions of the money demand equations in the Board's
quarterly and monthly models. While M1 growth may slow over the next two
months, growth in the nontransactions component of M2 is expected to pick up
from its depressed January pace and be more in line with growth in income,
thereby sustaining M2 growth at around an 8 percent annual rate.
","alternative B"
1984-03-26,16,"(16) The approach of alternative A would probably lead to
more rapid GNP growth over the spring and summer than in the staff's
current forecast. In such a case, this alternative increases the odds
that a substantial rise of interest rates later this year and into 1985
may be needed to keep money growth rates within their long-run target
bands and/or to forestall greater upward pressures than currently
projected on the average price level.

1984-07-16,16,"(17) Alternative B--which underlies the staff's GNP projection-

growth of that aggregate closer to the midpoint of its longer-run range
by the end of the year. Such June-to-September growth, distributed
fairly evenly over the quarter, would entail a 7-3/4 percent quarterly
average increase in M1. That growth in money may not involve much, if
any, further rise of interest rates over the summer, assuming nominal GNP
grows no faster than the 9-1/2 percent annual rate currently projected
for the third quarter and given the rise of interest rates that has already
taken place.
","Alternative B"
1984-12-17,16,"(16) Alternative C is designed to hold growth of M1 and M2 to
rates close to the midpoints of their tentative long-run ranges and is
expected to involve some tightening of reserve conditions. Borrowing
might rise back toward $800 million, with the federal funds rate returning
to the 9-1/2 to 10 percent area. Nonborrowed and total reserves would
increase at rates of around 10 percent from November to March. Such a
change in reserve conditions at this time would be quite unexpected by
market participants, and both short- and long-term rates would back up
considerably, with Treasury bill rates rising almost a percentage point
to 9 percent or a bit higher. Rates on private instruments might increase
by even more should investor concerns about creditworthiness be revived.
The dollar would probably rise further on foreign exchange markets.

1985-02-12,16,"(16) The specifications of alternative B, which are expected
to involve continuation of about the existing degree of pressure on

a longer period within the ranges of alternative II. Under the speci-
fications of B, M1 growth would slow to around a 7-1/2 percent annual
rate on average over February and March. Such a moderation of M1 is
expected to develop without appreciable firming in money markets as the

upward effects on money demand of the steep decline of interest rates
over recent months abate. Moreover, given the rapid growth of money late
in the fourth quarter and in January, a slowing in growth would still be
consistent with the expected increase in spending on goods and services
in the first quarter. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would increase at
a 9-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter under alternative B, and
velocity would decline at about a 1-1/4 percent annual rate, given the
staff's GNP projection. By March, M1 under this alternative would have
increased by about 8-3/4 percent from the QIV '84 long-run base.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1985-10-01,16,"(16) An easing of reserve pressures would be expected to keep M1
farther above its upper bound than under alternative B and increase the
likelihood that M2 would remain slightly above the upper end of its range
through December. The fall in market rates under alternative A could retard
a movement by the public away from highly liquid monetary assets. Deposits
subject to interest prohibitions or ceilings would become relatively more
attractive, while because of adjustment lags on offering rates, spreads for
super NOWs, MMDAs, and money funds relative to market instruments would
temporarily improve. In contrast, M3 would very likely stay well within its
annual range, moving only slightly more above its midpoint by December, as
reduced reliance by depository institutions on issuance of managed liabilities
partly offsets the greater influx of core deposits.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1986-04-01,16,"(16) Alternative C entails a firming of reserve conditions
characterized by discount window borrowing rising to around $500 million.
The federal funds rate would probably move up to the 7-3/4 to 8 percent
area. Such a tightening is not anticipated by market participants, and
substantial upward rate movements would probably occur. The 3-month bill
rate would rise to above 7 percent. Long-term rates would also back up
considerably for a time, but upward pressures should abate as corporate
bond issuance drops off and as incoming data continue to suggest low
inflation. The foreign exchange value of the dollar would tend to firm
over the short run.
","Alternative C"
1986-08-19,16,"(16) Alternative C assumes a tightening of reserve positions,
with borrowing from the discount window rising to around $500 million and the
federal funds rate backing up to the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent area. Under this
alternative, the slowing in M2 and M3 likely would be sufficient to move growth
of these aggregates to within the 7 to 9 percent three-month range established
at the last meeting. In addition, the tighter reserve conditions of this
alternative would place these aggregates on a trajectory that would better
assure that they would remain well within their annual ranges for the year.
Growth in M1 also would slow substantially by September and into the fourth
quarter as market interest rates backed up. Growth for the year still would
be considerably above the upper end of its range, however, perhaps in the
vicinity of 12 percent.
","Alternative C"
1986-09-23,16,"(16) Alternative C assumes an increase in discount borrowing to
$500 million. Federal funds might return to the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent area.
This tightening of reserve conditions would enhance the odds that M2 and M3
would come in within their ranges for this year. Growth in these aggregates
would be expected to slow to a 7-1/2 percent rate over the rest of the year.
M1 might decelerate significantly, as rates on small time deposits rose
relative to those on NOW accounts. Even so, with the opportunity costs of
holding NOW accounts remaining quite low, growth of M1 over the August-to-
December period might still average around 10 percent at an annual rate,
resulting in growth for the year of nearly 14 percent.
","Alternative C"
1986-11-05,16,"(16) Alternative C contemplates an increase in discount window
borrowing to $500 million. Federal funds would be expected to trade around
the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent area. The tighter reserve conditions of this
alternative would be expected to restrain growth in M2 and M3, raising the
odds that these aggregates would come within their long-term ranges for
interest rates also would act to damp M1 growth, although with opportunity
costs still relatively small this aggregate would continue to expand rapidly,
well in excess of income growth.
","Alternative C"
1987-03-31,16,"(16) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with a
borrowing level of $500 million, which would push the federal funds rate up
to the 6-1/2 percent area. The three-month bill rate would rise about 50
basis points under this alternative and CD rates possibly by more. The
increase in interest rates would tend to relieve downward pressure on the
dollar, at least for a while. Bond rates would rise, as there appears
to be little expectation in the markets of a tightening, although any such
increase would be limited by sentiment that such a move was acting to
contain inflationary pressures, in part through its effect on the dollar.
","alternative C, alternative a"
1987-05-19,16,"(16) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates would retrace
their recent increases. Unless it were accompanied by substantial easing
moves abroad, the exchange value of the dollar would move sharply downward,
heightening inflation concerns. Under these conditions bond yields would be
unlikely to decline much, if at all.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1987-08-18,16,"(16) Alternative C assumes an increase in the reserve path allow-
ance for discount window borrowing to $700 million. Federal funds probably
would trade in a 7 to 7-1/4 percent range and bill rates would move commensu-
rately higher. A near-term firming of monetary policy does not now seem
widely anticipated and long-term rates probably would tend to rise under this
alternative. However, any such backup might be limited if such a policy
action were seen as indicative of continued Federal Reserve commitment to
restraining inflation. The dollar's recent firmness in exchange markets
would be more likely to persist, at least for a time.
","Alternative C"
1987-09-22,16,"(16) Under alternative A, all of the monetary aggregates likely
would accelerate from their pace of recent months, bringing M3 to the lower
bound of its long-run range. Both M2 and M3 would be expected to end the
year growing at rates that fall within, but in the lower portions of, their
tentative ranges for next year. As short-term rates retraced much of their
recent advances, opportunity costs would act as only a minor drag on M2 in
the caning months, especially on its M1 and other liquid components. Con-
sequently, M1 and M2 would expand at rates more in line with income over the
fourth quarter. M3 would be expected to strengthen to a 6-1/4 percent rate
over the August-to-December period as larger core deposit inflows to banks
and thrifts would not be offset completely by smaller issuance of managed
Directive language
","alternative A"
1987-11-03,16,"(16) Under alternative A, the further easing of the funds rate
could help allay investor concerns about immediate financial strains. Other
private rates in money markets would slip off further, although the 3-month
bill rate might rise into the 5-1/2 percent area. Precautionary demands for
liquid monetary assets might unwind more rapidly under this alternative.
But the sharply narrower spreads of market over deposit rates would seem
likely to encourage large inflows into liquid accounts. Growth in OCDs
would be especially affected, with expansion in M1 likely to average 9 per-
cent over September to December. M2 would be expected to increase at a
picked up noticeably from September when inflows had been damped by pre-
vious increases in interest rates.
","alternative A"
1988-02-09,16,"(16) Alternative B contemplates a continuation of reserve
conditions now expected to prevail after the recent slight easing. Although
market participants may be uncertain as to whether a reduction in reserve
pressures has already occurred, the structure of market interest rates
suggests that some easing has already been discounted. With federal funds
around the 6-5/8 percent area, the three-month Treasury bill rate would
likely fluctuate around or a little above its recent 5-5/8 percent level.
This bill rate is unusually low relative to the expected funds rate, but
public supplies of Treasury bills continue to be reduced by Treasury
paydowns. Rates on private money market instruments also would be expected
to remain around current reduced levels prompting another 1/4 percentage
point cut in the prime rate as the spread between the prime and money market
yields still remains wide after this week's reduction. The recent rally in

the long-term credit markets appears to reflect an outlook for sluggish
economic growth, broadly consistent with the staff forecast; consequently,
long-term rates are expected to vary around current levels, absent renewed
substantial downward pressure on the dollar.
","Alternative B"
1988-03-29,16,"(16) Under alternative A, the easing of reserve market condi-
tions would ripple through other financial markets. The 3-month Treasury
bill would drop to below 5-1/2 percent, but declines in longer-term rates
might be small. Absent a weaker economic picture than contemplated under
the staff forecast, market participants may not expect such a policy easing
to be sustained for long. The dollar could come under substantial downward
pressures, particularly if concerns about inflation and external adjustment
","alternative A"
1988-06-29,16,"(16) The policy alternatives presented below include the current
degree of pressure on reserve positions along with somewhat greater and
slightly lesser restraint. Alternative B would continue to specify
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window of $550 million.
Alternative C would specify a borrowing level of $750 million. Under
alternative A, borrowing is assumed to decline only $100 million, to $450
million, reversing the most recent increase and part of the tightening
early in the period. Federal funds are expected to trade in a range
around 7-1/2 percent or a little below under alternative B and would move
up toward the 8 percent area under alternative C and down to 7-1/4 percent
or a bit below under alternative A.
","Alternative B, Alternative C, alternative A, alternative B, alternative C, alternative A"
1988-11-01,16,"(16) With little anticipation of a near-term tightening of
policy remaining in the market, short-term interest rates would climb
about 1/2 percentage point under alternative C. The dollar probably
would reverse some of its recent decline, and long-term interest rates
also would rise. The extent of this rise could be relatively small if
the tightening of policy were interpreted as damping activity and reduc-
ing inflationary risks in an economy that was already seen to be
experiencing more moderate growth.
","alternative C"
1989-12-18,16,"(16) With the further drop in interest rates, growth in M2 would
strengthen under alternative A to a 9 percent annual rate over the Novem-
ber-to-March period, placing this aggregate noticeably above the upper end
of its tentative growth cone. In the absence of a subsequent tightening
of policy, expansion of M2 would be likely to remain quite strong for some
time, especially if the lower interest rates fed through to greater spend-
ing and demand for money than in the staff forecast. Under alternative A,
growth in M3 would firm to a 6 percent rate over the November-to-March
period, a bit above the midpoint of its tentative 1990 range. A decline
in market rates might not boost M3 in line with previous experience, since
higher prices on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities could encourage
the sale of assets by thrifts.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1990-12-18,16,"(16) Some of the acceleration in M2 under alternative B would
show through to M3. Nonetheless, M3 expansion would be held to a 1/2
percent rate from November to March, displaying only slightly less weak-
ness than in recent months and coming in below the one percent lower bound
of the Committee's provisional growth range for 1991. A variety of fac-
tors are expected to continue to limit growth in this aggregate. Thrift
credit is projected to contract further; bank credit expansion, though
likely to pick up after the turn of the year, should remain subdued, espe-
cially if further losses in loan portfolios continue to put pressure on
capital positions. In the near term, banks are likely to use some of the
reserve balances released by the drop in reserve requirements to pay down
managed liabilities and shrink their footings. For a time, this scale
effect should dominate the longer-term impact of the reduced reserve cost
of issuing nonpersonal time deposits and borrowing from own foreign
branches. Finally, the hike in the insurance premium from 12 to 19-1/2
basis points on domestic deposits at commercial banks may marginally deter
bank intermediation and encourage a shifting of large time deposits into
term RPs or offshore. Of course, M3 would be little affected on net by
such shifting since term RPs and term Eurodollars owned by U.S. residents
are included in M3.
","alternative B"
1992-03-31,16,"(16) M2 growth would slacken to a 2-1/2 percent rate over the
March-to-June period under alternative C, bringing this aggregate ap-
preciably below the midpoint of its annual range. Much of the slowing
would be in its M1 component. In the context of a somewhat more uncer-
tain outlook for the recovery, bankers might remain highly cautious
lenders and continue to hold their balance sheets in check; sluggish
bank credit growth and likely runoffs of M3 money funds would imply M3
growth of only 1 percent at an annual rate over the March-to-June

This alternative would stress the Committee's expectation of a resump-

1992-06-30,16,"(16) Alternative I might be selected if the prospects for a
return to more normal money demand and therefore M2 growth were seen as
greater than envisioned by the staff. This range also might be pre-
ferred if recent weakness in M2 were thought to be signalling slower
output growth than in the staff forecast--including a risk to the
recovery itself. In addition, as noted, attempts to hit the lower end
of this range would be more consistent with a strategy that endeavored
to make greater progress in reducing unemployment rates than in the
staff forecast. Depending on how it was presented, choice of this
alternative could signal that the Committee would not be complacent
about undershooting its current range; in these circumstances, pressure
to reexamine the System's stance in reserve markets would be present
with growth below the ranges. Instead, the Committee could choose to
retain the current range because it was so uncertain about money-income
relationships that any change was seen as implying more knowledge of
those relationships and commitment to achieving the new range than it
felt appropriate. In that event, the Committee would need to explain
that shortfalls from the unchanged range might not warrant policy
action. Actions to return M2 to its alternative I range would tend to
move M3 closer to its range; however, since any easing action to boost
M2 growth would have less impact on M3 expansion, there is a greater

sures on quality spreads in the banking sector might be exacerbated by
uncertainty about the circle of candidates subject to early closure. In
capital markets, yields could edge down on balance as the readings that
trickle in over the intermeeting period indicate a modest pace to the
economic expansion and imply further progress toward price stability.
At the same time, concerns about the prospects for fiscal stimulus and
uncertainties about the economic policies of the new administration more
generally, which may not be resolved for some time, will continue to
weigh upon market sentiment.

1993-05-18,16,"(16) The lower interest rates of alternative A would be ex-
pected to provide some added lift to growth of the monetary aggregates.
Banks and thrifts, while continuing to price their deposits unaggres-
sively, likely would not immediately match the downward movement in
market rates. Yields on money market mutual funds, likewise, would lag
the decline in market rates. The lower opportunity costs of deposits
and money funds relative to short-term market rates should provide a
small boost to the aggregates, even though attractive yields would
continue to induce heavy inflows into bond and stock mutual funds. M2
growth over May and June would come in at about a 6 percent rate, with
much of the additional strength resulting from its M1 component. M3
would expand at a 4-1/4 percent rate. Despite the more rapid growth,
both of the broad monetary aggregates would remain well below their
annual ranges in June. M2 growth is projected to post a 2-3/4 percent
pace from June to September, bringing the rate of expansion for the
April to September period to 4 percent. Even with the lower interest
rates and consequent economic stimulus of this alternative later in the
year, M2 would be unlikely to reach the lower end of its annual range by
the fourth quarter.

rate over the February-to-June period under alternative B, up from
only 3/4 percent over January and February, even as growth in nominal
income continues to slow. A resumption of inflows to M2 money market
mutual funds, owing in part to the lessened appeal of bond funds,

tinue to rise in the second quarter under alternative B, but its

1994-12-20,16,"(16) Under alternative C, opportunity costs would tend to
increase as the rise in money market rates outpaced those on M2 com-
ponents. M2 would expand at only a 1/2 percent rate over the Novem-
ber-to-March period, restrained by faster runoffs of M1 and savings
deposits (including MMDAs) than under alternative B. By March, M2
would stand about 1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1994 base, a
little below the bottom of its provisional growth range for 1995. M3
would expand at a 2 percent pace through March, damped by outflows
from M3-type money market mutual funds. Growth in M3 from the fourth
quarter of 1994 to March would be at a 2 percent rate, at the midpoint
of its provisional range for 1995.

1995-05-23,16,"(16) M3 is projected to decelerate appreciably to a 3-3/4
percent pace over the April-September period. With business and
household credit growth running a bit slower than over the first few
months of the year and shifting toward longer-term markets, the growth
likely prompt a slackened pace of issuance of managed liabilities,
including large time deposits, repurchase agreements, and borrowings
from foreign offices. Nonetheless, M3 is projected to remain above
the upper end of its current 0-to-4 percent annual range through
September under alternative B, and even the tighter reserve market
conditions of alternative C would not likely be adequate to bring M3
within its range by September.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1995-12-19,16,"(16) In the staff forecast, bank credit growth edges up in
the next few months from its recent depressed rate, as banks stop
running off securities. With Japanese branches and agencies already
having shifted financing to their home offices or other affiliates,
the runoff of CDs at these institutions should wind down, so that
going forward depository institutions as a whole rely more on liabili-
ties in M3 to finance credit growth. Expansion of M3 picks up to a
alternative B. M2 growth also firms from its unexpectedly weak pace
so far in the fourth quarter. The projected rebound in nominal income
growth supports an acceleration of retail deposits, and the lagged
effects of recent declines in short-term rates and associated reduc-
tions in opportunity costs also buoy money demand. M2 would be just
above the upper end of its provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range in
March, and M3 would be at the upper end of its tentative 2 to 6 per-
cent range.
","alternative B"
1998-12-22,16,"(16) Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are likely to decelerate substantially. The growth
of M2 in the first quarter will probably continue to exceed that of nominal income, in part
reflecting the lingering effects of the decline in market interest rates in the latter part of 1998. As
a result, velocity will decline, but by only about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate, approximately
one-half of the pace that appears to have occurred in the current quarter. The slowing in the
decline in velocity owes in part to a tapering off of the enhanced demands for liquidity that
accompanied the financial turmoil. M3 is projected to grow faster than M2 as bank credit should
continue to expand rapidly, financed in part with wholesale instruments, and as inflows of
institution-only money funds are expected to stay brisk. Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are
projected to expand over the November-to-March period at annual rates of 7-1/2 and 9 percent,
respectively. Under all of the alternatives, M2 and M3 by March would be well above their
provisional ranges.

2001-01-30,16,"(16) If the Committee thought the economy might well be weaker than in the
staff forecast, it may wish to take another substantial easing action by cutting the
federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, as in alternative AN.  As the
recession simulation illustrated, a substantial shortfall in demand would require
prompt and forceful policy action.  Even  if the Committee thought the staff forecast
was the most reasonable po int estimate, it might still favor a 50 basis point easing if it
perceived that the probabilities around that outcom e were skewed toward
considerably softer demand than in that forecast.  With inflation and inflation
expectations likely to remain quiescent for a while, a substantial easing to cushion
downside risks to economic activity is unlikely to boost materially the risk of greater
inflation pressures.  Indeed, a substantial easing might also be viewed as appropria te if
the Committee did not see outsized downside risks to demand but thought price
pressures were unlikely to intensify at an unemployment rate near its current level, as
in the 4 percent NAIRU simulation earlier in this bluebook.  Financial market
participants currently have built in high odds of a ½ percentage point cut in the funds
rate at this meeting.  Although conditions in some segments of financial markets have
improved in recent weeks, developments in the commercial paper and bank loan
markets indicate that suppliers of funds remain quite wary.  Under these
circumstances, the effects of surprising the markets with a smaller easing could be
especially adverse.
","alternative A"
2004-06-29,16,"(16) The Committee might view the largely unanticipated step-up in inflation
in recent months that has yet to be reversed as vitiating its previous conditional
expectation that policy moves could be measured.  If so, a 50-basis-point increase in
the federal funds rate, as in Alternative C, might be favored if Committee members
doubt that inflation will be restrained by slack in the economy to the extent forecast
by the staff, either because of skepticism about the output gap framework or concern
that the economy is closer to potential than estimated by the staff, as in the Less
Room to Grow scenario in the Greenbook.  Alternatively, members might favor this
option if they put greater odds than the staff does on the possibility of a sizable pass-
through of higher energy and import prices to the general price level.  Also, a
relatively large policy move could be viewed as necessary at this point in part to reduce 
the potential for a sustained increase in inflation expectations.  Indeed, the Committee
may be troubled that longer-term inflation expectationseven before their recent
uptickseemed to embed an anticipation that prices would increase at a rate faster
than that consistent with long-run price stability, perhaps indicating that there was
some uncertainty among the public about the Federal Reserves objective.  If the
Committees goal is to keep the bias-adjusted consumer price level unchanged on
average, roughly consistent with measured core PCE inflation of 1 percent, the
simulations reported earlier suggest that a somewhat firmer near-term path of policy
than in the baseline would be desirable.
","Alternative C"
2004-08-10,16,"(16) With market participants interpreting a measured pace as implying at
most 25-basis-point moves, policymakers probably would want to alter that phrase
significantly or drop it from an announcement of Alternative C.  While some
policymakers might prefer not to provide guidance about the likely pace of policy
change, they may be comfortable giving an indirect indication of its probable
direction.  If so, the last sentence of the announcement might read: In current
circumstances, the Committee believes that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if sustained
over the next few quarters, could foster economic growth that is more likely to be above than below its
long-run sustainable pace.  Similarly, with respect to the Committees goal of price stability, such an
unchanged policy stance implies greater risks to the upside than the downside. 5  Given the
explicit conditioning on the stance of policy in this assessment, a reference to the role
of monetary accommodation in the first sentence of the rationale paragraph would be
redundant.  That paragraph might instead begin: The Committee continues to believe that
robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity.  If the
Committee thinks that the soft patch in the economy is probably behind us and that
conditions are in place for a robust snap-back, it might also want to state that output
growth appears poised to resume a stronger pace going forward.  To underscore its concerns
about the effect of energy price increases on the inflation outlook, the Committee
might want to say: Although a portion of the rise in inflation this year appears to have been due
to transitory factors, continuing and substantial increases in energy prices are putting persistent
upward pressure on costs and overall prices.
","Alternative C"
2004-09-21,16,"(16) Adoption of Alternative C would surprise market participants and, given
the precedent of the marked reaction when the considerable period sentence was
modified in January, could prompt significant swings in financial prices.  The path
expected for the funds rate would rotate up, and market participants probably would
become somewhat more chary about risk-taking.  Equity prices, in all likelihood,
would decline.  Interest rates would jump, although the rise in bond yields could be
damped should equity prices fall steeply.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2004-11-10,16,"(16) The announcement of Alternative A would indicate an unchanged target
federal funds rate but otherwise might look fairly similar to the announcement for the
September meeting.  The statement might characterize policy as somewhat
accommodative while the final sentence would underscore the Committees
commitment to both its price stability and sustainable growth objectives.  Given the
actual pause in policy adjustment, the cumulative increase wording employed in
Alternative B would not seem necessary.  Such an announcement would come as a
surprise to market participants.  Both real and nominal yields would likely decline and
stock prices could increase.  However, if investors interpreted the announcement as
portending weaker-than-expected economic activity, the rise in stock prices might be
muted while the drop in yields could be more pronounced.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2004-12-14,16,"(16) If the Committee were concerned that maintenance of current financial
conditions could risk a return to subpar economic performance, it might want to
consider a pause in the tightening cycle at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Recent
data and anecdotal reports suggest that businesses remain unusually cautious in
expanding payrolls.  In addition, the expiration of the partial expensing provision at
year-end could slow investment spending more than in the Greenbook.  Moreover,
household saving rates remain very low by historical standards, and a larger-than-
expected rebound in saving propensities could damp household spending
considerably.  Given these uncertainties, and with 100 basis points of tightening
already in place, the Committee might consider it prudent to stand pat at this meeting
to foster easier financial market conditions and weigh incoming data before
considering the appropriate course for policy in February.
","Alternative A"
2005-02-01,16,"(16) The draft statement offered in Alternative B is quite similar to that released
following the December meeting in its evaluation of recent economic conditions,
assessment of balanced risks to the goals of stable prices and sustainable growth, and
retention of the familiar measured pace language.  Futures market quotes suggest
that investors are confident of quarter-point policy steps at this meeting and the next,
and primary dealers responding to the Desks survey were unanimous in expecting no
change in the Committees assessment of the balance of risks at this meeting.  The
minutes of the December meeting, however, may have led analysts to expect a sign of
heightened worries about the inflation outlook, which is missing from the draft
statement provided in Table 1, and its release probably would be accompanied by an
edging lower of yields, a bit of a rally in equity markets, and a small decline in the
exchange value of the dollar.
","Alternative B"
2005-03-22,16,"(16) Although the risk assessment paragraphs in Alternatives A and C are similar,
the characterizations of the economy and prices in the rationale paragraphs are quite
different.  Under Alternative A, the rationale paragraph would suggest that the
Committee sees the stance of monetary policy as somewhat accommodative and
regards the recent uptick in inflation readings as transitory, with underlying inflation
and inflation expectations remaining well-contained.  Such sentiments, along with the
observation that the firming of policy had cumulated to 175 basis points, would seem
to signal a pause sometime soon.  In contrast, the language for Alternative C would
suggest that output growth is proceeding at a pace that seems likely to eliminate
resource slack in the near term and would note that inflation pressures have
intensified, signaling a pickup in the pace of firming.  Such language may be favored
in order to indicate that the Committee could begin to tighten more forcefully
sometime soon even if it moves 25 basis points at this meeting.
","Alternative A, Alternative C"
2005-05-03,16,"(16) Market participants would not likely miss the hints in the announcement
of Alternative A of a higher likelihood of a pause in June.  Intermediate- and longer-
term interest rates probably would drop appreciably, and equity markets would rally.
The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would decrease along with the
drop in U.S. yields.  These market moves might be more sizable if investors read the
short rates or the relative importance of longer-term yields has been overstated historically because 
in prior episodes they covaried closely with short rates.

statement as evidence that inflation pressures could be less intense than previously
perceived.  In any event, market participants would likely be especially sensitive to
readings on inflation over the upcoming intermeeting period.
","Alternative A"
2005-06-29,16,"(16) The Committee may believe that the 2¼-percentage-point cumulative
tightening over the past year implied by a 25-basis-point move at this meeting would
amount to a substantial reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation
and that, after Thursday, the real federal funds rate may be within a notch or two of
its sustainable level.  As can be seen in Chart 7, a 25-basis-point step next week plus
one more such action would bring the real funds rate close to the lower edge of the
range of model-based estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate.  Particularly if the
Committee is averse to quick reversals in the direction of policy adjustment, it may be
inclined to move relatively slowly after this meeting in order to allow more time to
gauge the effects of recent policy actions and to avoid overshooting with its policy
instrument.  In this case, the FOMC may be attracted to Alternative As combination
of a 25-basis-point hike in the funds rate at this meeting and statement wording that
hints that the Committee could soon pause, at least for a time, in its process of policy
firming.  Members might view such an indication as allowing for a smoother
transition toward a reasonably sustainable policy stance.  And with economic growth
having slowed somewhat in the second quarter and investors concerns about
inflation apparently having diminished significantly in recent weeks, the Committee
may see little risk that such a signal would compromise its credibility regarding the
pursuit of its price stability objective.  If the Committee saw a 2 percent inflation
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 21 of 42
target as appropriate, then, as shown in Chart 5 of the previous section of the
Bluebook, monetary tightening going forward can be considerably more gradual than
it has been over the past year.  Winding down the process of tightening, at least for
now, would also presumably be favored to the extent that members read the net
reduction in, and low level of, long-term yields as a signal that market participants
harbored doubts about the continued robustness of economic expansion.
","Alternative A"
2005-08-09,16,"(16) If the Committee has become significantly more concerned about inflation
pressures of late, it may favor the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate of
Alternative C.  Greater worries about inflation prospects could have been prompted
by the brisk growth in aggregate demand apparently in train in the current quarter,
which could be read as suggesting that asset prices are not exerting sufficient restraint
on spending to keep actual output from overshooting its potential before long.
Moreover, members may see the potential for an intensification of cost pressures
stemming from a variety of sources.  The further rise in far-dated oil futures prices
over the intermeeting period, for example, suggests that business energy costs will
ratchet up somewhat further in coming months.  Also, members may be concerned
about the potential for further acceleration in unit labor costs if their assessment of
the NAIRU is noticeably higher than the staffs estimate of 5 percent or if they judge
that structural productivity growth could be slowing more sharply than estimated by
the staff.  Indeed, the slower growth of productivity in recent quarters as well as the
lower estimates of productivity implied by the annual revisions to the national income
and product accounts might incline policymakers to trim their views of structural
productivity even more than has the staff.  And, even if they had a baseline outlook
for the economy and prices similar to that in the Greenbook forecast, members may
prefer lower inflation than the 2 percent core PCE rate projected by the staff for late
","Alternative C"
2005-09-20,16,"(16) Another possible reason for holding the funds rate unchanged is that a
longer pause in policy firming could be appropriate.  Committee members may be
concerned that the widespread and severe damage to private property and
infrastructure in the Gulf region, the extended displacement of a large population, the
sharp increase in consumer energy prices, and a potential significant drop in consumer
confidence could well exert a more substantial drag on aggregate economic activity
than in the staff forecast.  Such a possibility is illustrated in the Greenbooks
sentiment slump scenario and the scenario based on a pessimistic view of the
effects of Katrina.  Moreover, while the stance of policy may still be accommodative,
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 38
the extent of that accommodation has been reduced significantly by the Committees
actions through August.  Thus, the Committee may feel comfortable awaiting further
Opening Up the Statement
The measured pace language, which has been included in the 
Committees statements for the past eleven meetings, has served to signal to 
market participants that the federal funds rate will be marched up steadily as long 
as policy accommodation remains in place.  The Committee may believe that this 
language has now outlived its usefulness for several reasons, independent of this 
meetings outcome on the stance of policy.  First, the 2½-percentage-point 
increase in the nominal federal funds rate since mid-2004 has placed the real 
federal funds rate near some model-based estimates of its equilibrium (as shown 
in Chart 5).  By that arithmetic, some members might be of the view that policy 
accommodation has been substantially removed and that the Committee should 
halt the process of firming sometime soon.  Second, the devastation in the Gulf 
region probably implies that more uncertainty attends the outlook, and this 
uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved soon, perhaps increasing the attractiveness 
of being more gradual in removing policy accommodation.  Third, the 
possibilities that elevated energy prices, on the one hand, could sap consumer 
confidence or, on the other, unanchor inflation expectations may require more 
nimble adjustments to the stance of policy than consistent with the measured 
pace language.
In prior discussions of statement language, some have expressed a
preference for providing signals about the future direction of policy only in 
unusual situations, if at all.  In that view, guidance about interest rates, which 
seemed useful when significant disinflation was a risk and at the outset of policy 
tightening, is no longer useful when the Committee is unsure about its actions at 
the next few meetings.  The simple expedient, then, would be to drop rows 5 and 
6 and any mention of the extent of policy accommodation in Table 1.
Others have argued, however, that providing information about the future
direction of the federal funds rate helps the public make better-informed 
decisions, enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Moreover, simply 
stating that the Committee was not certain whether the next move in rates would 
be up or down would, on this view, be useful information to market participants.

information on the effects of Hurricane Katrina, as well as of the cumulative
tightening of policy to date, before resuming policy firmingeven if that wait could
be extended.  Such a view could be conveyed to the public by striking sentence 2 from
the draft statement for Alternative A.  The statement could also drop the word
action that now appears in row 5 in order to suggest that appropriate monetary
Opening Up the Statement (cont.)
One way of regaining flexibility about the range of future action while still 
providing such information would be to eliminate the measured pace language 
from the statement and move from the current practice of basing the risk 
assessment on appropriate policy to assuming explicitly that the current stance of 
policy will be kept unchanged for several quarters.  Under such an assumption, 
the assessments of the probabilities of lower or higher economic growth than is 
sustainable and of lower or higher inflation, along with an overall risk assessment 
if needed, can provide guidance about the future direction of policy.  Rows 5 and 
6 of Table 1 in both columns A and B could be replaced with the following 
formula:
The Committees economic outlook is such that, if the federal 
funds rate were maintained at its current level for the next several 
quarters, output growth is [less/as/more] likely to be above 
[as/than] below its sustainable pace.  Inflation over the same period 
is [less/as/more] likely to increase [as to/than] decrease.  As a 
result, the Committee views the near-term risks to its dual 
objectives as [tilted to the downside/balanced/tilted to the upside].  
In any event, the Committee is prepared to take the steps necessary 
to maintain price stability and sustainable economic growth.
If the Committee desires to convey the sense that the current stance of policy is 
unsustainably easy, it could set both toggle switches to their more setting.  
That is, it would tell the public that, if maintained for the next few quarters, a 
nominal funds rate of 3½ percent (under A) or 3¾ percent (under B) would 
likely foster a pickup in resource utilization and inflation.  As both 
measurements would point in the same direction, the overall risk balance 
sentence could be omitted in this case with no harm to clarity.

policy going forward would not necessarily involve near-term tightening, and refer to
remaining policy accommodation in the first sentence in row 6.

","Alternative A"
2005-12-13,16,"(16)   If the Committee takes this view, then it might be inclined to retain some
of the statement language used at its last meeting.  Such a statement could start by
indicating that the economic expansion remains vigorous.  Given the strength seen in
underlying aggregate demand and the possible upward pressures on inflation, the
statement might continue to characterize the stance of policy as accommodative.  The
inflation discussion could note that relatively high levels of resource utilization as
well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  The
reference to the relatively high levels of resource utilization, in contrast to the
concerns about possible increases in resource utilization expressed in Alternative B,
would indicate greater concern about pressures on inflation arising from this source
and might suggest that monetary policy now would be oriented particularly toward
slowing growth in aggregate demand to a pace at or below that of potential output.
The assessment of risks portion of the statement could again indicate that, with
appropriate policy, the risks to both of the Committees dual objectives should be
kept roughly balanced and that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured
","Alternative B"
2006-01-31,16,"(16) Futures markets and surveys suggest that investors are sure of a 25 basis
point policy firming at this meeting and place greater than even odds on another such
move in March.  Therefore, selection of this policy move coupled with the language
of Alternative B likely would not result in substantial changes in financial market
prices.  Short-term interest rates might edge lower and stocks could rally a bit as
market participants strengthen their expectations that the tightening phase may be
drawing to a close.  Offsetting this effect somewhat, implied volatilities on options on
money market futures may step up as the Committee sends a less confident signal
about its future action.
","Alternative B"
2006-03-27,16,"(16) The nominal federal funds rate already lies at the top end of the range of
recommendations from policy rules provided in Charts 6 and 7, and given the
substantial cumulative tightening of monetary policy to date and the long lags in the
effects of policy on the economy, members may be inclined to signal that the firming
cycle has likely drawn to a close, as in Alternative A.  Committee members may
prefer this alternative if they see the current level of core inflation as roughly
consistent with price stability or believe that the staff has overestimated the NAIRU
or understated the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored, as discussed
in alternative simulations in the Greenbook.  This alternative may also be favored if
members are concerned about downside risks to the economy coming from, for
example, a more pronounced cooling in the housing market than anticipated by the
staff.  In that regard, the markets expectation for the funds rate to decline modestly in
tighten too much.
","Alternative A"
2006-05-10,16,"(16) The sizable rise over the intermeeting period in long-term nominal interest
rates (which apparently included a significant pickup in compensation for expected
inflation), the weakening of the exchange value of the dollar, and the rise in some
survey measures of inflation expectations could be read by members as evidence of an
erosion in the publics confidence in the Committees commitment to price stability.
If so, the combination of a half-point action at this meeting and the words presented
in Alternative C might be appealing.  With energy prices having risen sharply further
in recent weeks, the Committee could be concerned that elevated energy and
commodity prices and relatively high levels of resource utilization may begin to leave a
more distinct imprint on core inflation and inflation expectations.  Moreover,
members may believe that core inflation currently is already at or above the upper end
of an acceptable range, inclining them to foster a steeper downward trajectory in
inflation than that forecast in the Greenbook.  In that regard, the alternative
simulation provided earlier suggests that the nominal federal funds rate would need to
reach 5¾ percent by year-end to foster a 1½ percent inflation goal over the next few
","Alternative C"
2006-06-28,16,"(16) Market participants are somewhat more confident that the Committee will
tighten at its August meeting than the wording of Alternative B suggests.  As a result,
investors would trim back their near-term policy expectations, and short-term interest
rates would probably decline slightly.  The policy surprise might add to expected
volatility, as market participants became a little less sure of the predictability of the
Committees behavior.  The downward revision to expectations would tend to lower
longer-term yields, but some of that decline might be offset by a backup in term
premiums.  Stock prices would likely rally some, and downward pressure on the
foreign exchange value of the dollar could emerge.
","Alternative B"
2006-08-08,16,"(16) The rationale presented for Alternative A in the post-meeting statement
could be similar to that for Alternative B, since both alternatives would keep the
federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  However, the assessment of risks could
simply point to the dependence of future policy adjustments on incoming
information.  Against the backdrop of its statements over the previous two years, in
which the Committee either provided explicit rate guidance or pointed to upside
inflation risks, such an announcement would likely suggest to market participants that
the Committee was not predisposed to raising rates or lowering them going forward.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2006-09-20,16,"(16) The rationale for Alternative A could be similar to that for Alternative B,
except that the Committee may wish to note explicitly that recent inflation readings
have been slightly more favorable than those of previous months.  In the risk
assessment, the Committee would mention downside risks to growth and indicate that
future policy adjustments, implicitly in either direction, will depend on the
implications of incoming data for the outlook.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2006-10-24,16,"(16) This Bluebook presents three formal policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, associated with the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A
and B, the Committee would again leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at
this meeting; Alternative A would indicate that the Committee has no clear view as to
the likely future direction of policy, whereas Alternative B would repeat the statement
from September that further policy tightening may prove necessary.  Under
Alternative C, the Committee would increase the target rate 25 basis points at this
meeting and continue to stress upside risks to inflation.  In all three, the Committee
would acknowledge that economic growth appears to have slowed further in the third
quarter, but the characterization of growth going forward varies across the

2007-01-30,16,"(16) In light of the flurry of stronger-than-expected economic data over the
intermeeting period, the rationale paragraph in the statement under Alternative B
could indicate that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.  It could
drop the reference to a substantial cooling of the housing market and note, instead,
that although some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing
market, weakness in residential construction remains a drag on economic growth.
With regard to inflation, the statement could acknowledge that readings on core
inflation have improved modestly in recent months, but reiterate the Committees
concern that inflation pressures remain.  In its assessment of risks, the Committee
could essentially repeat the language from its statement in December.
","Alternative B"
2007-03-20,16,"(16) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives, summarized in Table 1, as
a starting point for the Committees deliberations.  Under Alternative A, the
Committee would lower the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent.
Alternative B would leave the target for the federal funds rate unchanged.  Under
Alternative C, the Committee would tighten policy 25 basis points, bringing the target
to 5½ percent.  The statement associated with Alternative A mentions factors that
suggest upside risks to inflation and retains the phrase some inflation risks remain;
it also mentions factors that suggest downside risks to growth and offers an explicit
assessment that the risks to growth are tilted to the downside.  In addition, Alternative
A replaces the phrase the extent and timing of any additional firming with the more
general future policy adjustments.  Alternative B, too, notes factors that suggest
downside risks to growth as well as factors that suggest upside risks to inflation, but
states explicitly that the risk that inflation will fail to moderate remains the
Committees principal concern.  Alternative B also adopts more symmetric language
regarding future policy adjustments.  Language for Alternative C not only states that
the risk that inflation will fail to moderate remains the Committees predominant
concern, it does not mention downside risks to growth and retains directional
language referring to the extent and timing of any additional firming.  With the
report on consumer prices in February to be released on Friday, after the Bluebook
closes, the rationale portion of Alternative B includes language in brackets that may be
appropriate if inflation is disappointingly high.

2007-05-09,16,"(16) Even if the Committee views the staffs central outlook as broadly
plausible and desirable, members may judge that the risk of persistently weaker
economic growth is unacceptably large.  If so, the Committee might wish to reduce
the chance of a more pronounced economic slowdown by easing policy 25 basis
points as in Alternative A.  The recent disappointing data on home sales and
inventories of new homes for sale may heighten concern that the extent of the
ongoing adjustment in the housing market and associated spillovers to household and
business spending could be greater than currently anticipated.  Moreover, members
might worry that the economic fundamentals supporting the expansion going forward
could be less robust than envisaged by the staff.  In particular, the recent weakness in
business spending may indicate that firms have grown less optimistic about future
returns, which could continue to weigh on investment plans in coming quarters.  This

relative pessimism could also conceivably color firms hiring decisionsespecially if
the recent strength of employment is a lagging phenomenon reflecting labor
hoardingand so damp prospects for households income and consumption.  And
financial conditions might turn less favorable; in particular, long rates may move
significantly higher if monetary policy is not eased as expected, and equity prices could
fall short of the Greenbook projection if corporate earnings slow as anticipated by the
staff.  The possibility that the fundamentals supporting the economic expansion might
prove to be weaker than expected is explored in the Greenbook alternative simulation
Business caution with financial spillovers.

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers
the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B maintains the
target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Alternative C envisions the
Committee tightening by 25 basis points, to bring the target rate to 5½ percent.  As
for the wording of the statement, economic growth appears to have rebounded in the
second quarter from its anemic first-quarter pace.  Accordingly, the reference in the
previous statement indicating that economic growth slowed in the first part of the
year is updated in all three alternatives to indicate that the economy appears to have
expanded at a moderate pace so far this year.  This assessment is intended to smooth

ExtenExad fall Assessing the Implied Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Horizons using 
Interest Rate Caps 
 
The degree of uncertainty around the expected path of the federal funds rate can be assessed 
using implied volatilities derived from interest rate options.  Beginning with the January 
Bluebook, prices on interest rate caps, which are sequences of call options on three-month 
LIBOR, have been used to construct the confidence intervals for the funds rate shown 
through 2012 in Chart 7.1  Until this Bluebook, those estimates have been based solely on 
price quotes for at-the-money options, and following convention, it was assumed that 
interest rates were log-normally distributed.  By construction, the estimated distribution of 
interest rates was skewed somewhat toward higher rates.   
 
Recently, Board staff have analyzed in- and out-of-the-money interest rate caps to obtain 
information on the possible skew in the distribution of short-term interest rates.2  This 
analysis is broadly similar to the construction of the distribution of the expected federal 
funds rate six months ahead derived from options on Eurodollar futures that is shown in 
Chart 1.  Based on interest rate caps, the staff can now calculate risk-neutral, non-parametric 
probability density functions of future short-term rates from the near term to very distant 
horizons and monitor the width and skew of these distributions.   
 
These estimates generally suggest that the assumption that interest rates are log-normally 
distributed results in an underestimation of the weight market participants put on very low 
rates.  Over the last two years, the lower bound of the 90 percent confidence band about six 
years hence based on these density functions has been about 70 basis points below that 
derived from confidence intervals under the log-normal assumption.

inflation data for recent months have been benign, with the twelve-month change in
the core PCE deflator dropping to 2 percent in April for the first time since March of

stance of monetary policy should promote moderate growth over time, but
Alternatives A and C point to increased downside risks to growth.  In light of the
leveling out of non-energy commodity prices over the intermeeting period, each
alternative suggests that elevated energy and commodity prices, along with other
factors, may put upward pressure on inflation, instead of referring to recent increases

alternatives, the rationale paragraph refers to considerable stress in financial markets,
tightening of credit conditions, and the deepening of the housing contraction;
the three easing alternatives also mention the recent softening in labor markets.
Each alternative states that policymakers expect inflation to moderate this year
while emphasizing the need for careful monitoring of inflation developments.
All four alternatives note that the current stance of policy should help promote
moderate growth over time; Alternatives A and B also indicate that these policy
actions should help mitigate the risks to economic activity.  Alternative A states
that downside risks may well remain and that incoming information will determine
whether further action is needed to address those risks.  Alternative B states
that downside risks to growth remain whereas Alternatives C and D reiterate the
January 22 assessment that appreciable downside risks remain; all three of these

probably lead over time to expectations of further easing and encourage
banks to add more to loans and investments than otherwise, financing
them at very short-term in the Federal funds, Euro-dollar, and commercial
paper markets. In these circumstances, as the Federal Reserve provided
the reserves to keep the Federal funds rate down, demand deposits would
also tend to become somewhat stronger than otherwise. Thus, relative
to the alternative A projections, bank credit and deposit expansion,
might show a more noticeable strengthening in December than in November.

more emphasis on monetary and banking aggregates in the directive, it
may wish to consider the following language for the second paragraph.

AND CONDUCIVE TO MODEST AND ORDERLY EXPANSION IN THE MONETARY
AND BANKING AGGREGATES.
","alternative C"
1970-02-10,17,"(17) Under such conditions, banks might be in a position to regain
a substantial amount of CD's, Instead of an attrition running at about
the $100-$300 million per month rate likely under alternative A (depending
on the degree of firmness achieved under the specifications of that
alternative), we would expect banks at least to maintain outstanding CD's
at around the current $10 billion level. And if the bill rate fell to
to add to CD's. Indeed, they might well add substantial amounts if loan
demand remains strong or if they wish to replenish their liquidity and
to start rebuilding investment portfolios at attractive yields. Another
alternative for banks would be to move into CD's at the expense of non-
deposit sources. On balance, a reasonable guess would be that CD's
could rise at a rate of $500 million per month, or even more.
","alternative A"
1970-03-10,17,"(17) The anticipated weakness of the economy through the
second quarter suggests that it will be difficult to generate much more
growth in the money supply than indicated in alternative A without a
substantially lower level of interest rates. At the same time, the
continuing tight position of banks generally suggests that there would
be a sharp expansion in bank credit if market interest rates dropped
well below Regulation Q constraints, and banks thereby had the opportunity
to regain their market position through time deposits. As best we can
estimate the further easing in money market conditions specified in
paragraph (16) might be associated with a March growth rate of 12-15
per cent, annual rate, in total time deposits, and possibly with an
even further rebound in the spring quarter. The money supply might show
only a little more strength, with most of that later in the spring as
lower interest rates make it marginally more attractive to rebuild cash
balances. Mainly because of the rise in time deposits, the adjusted
bank credit proxy would also be stronger than under alternative A,
rising in an 8-11 per cent annual rate range in March and April together.
It is assumed that the additional time deposits obtained by banks would
substitute in part for funds now obtained through nondeposit sources.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1970-08-18,17,"(17) In the easier monetary environment envisaged, banks
would be likely to reduce offering rates on large CD's. Nevertheless,
with market rates reduced, total time deposits would be expected to grow
somewhat more rapidly than under alternative A. As a result of lower
domestic interest rates and strong inflows of funds, banks would probably
reduce Euro-dollar borrowings further, although whether individual banks
will permit such borrowings to fall below their reserve-free base is not
at all clear. Banks would also reduce their reliance on commercial paper
as a source of funds.
","alternative A"
1970-09-15,17,"(17) Attainment of the more rapid growth in the money supply
indicated in the above tables would require a more pronounced easing of
money market conditions than under Alternative A. These easier conditions
might include a Federal funds rate fluctuating in a 5-3/4--6-1/4 per cent
range, member bank borrowings around $300-$400 million and net borrowed
reserves in a $100-$250 million range. Such conditions could well
trigger an immediate cut in the prime rate and reduce the 3-month
Treasury bill rate to 6 per cent or below. Such a development might also
create expectations of a reduction in the Federal Reserve discount rate,
contributing to general downward pressures on interest rates, in both
short- and long-term markets. On the other hand, some partly offsetting
upward interest rate pressure, chiefly in longer maturity ranges,
might develop if there were a heightening of expectations that signifi-
cantly easier credit availability would lead to intensification of
inflationary conditions later on.

1970-12-15,17,"(17) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for
possible use if the Committee decides to set its target for money at
the 6 per cent rate indicated by the revised data to have prevailed
in the three quarters before the auto strike:
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

taining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent
with those objectives.

possible use if the Committee decides to step up its target growth
rate for money to 7 per cent:

with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market
conditions consistent with those objectives.

suggested because of the greater degree of credit market easing likely
to ensue under this policy course.

1971-01-12,17,"(20) Alternative C. This alternative is proposed for
possible use if the Committee decides to seek growth in money over the
first quarter at a faster rate than would be required simply to make
up the fourth quarter shortfall. One possible growth rate under this
alternative--8-1/2 per cent--was noted in paragraph (6C) above.
To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO
PROMOTE EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MORE

Whereas alternative B includes a statement to the effect that ""the
Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets,""
the word ""some"" is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alter-
native. This difference reflects the expectation that interest rates
would decline somewhat more under this alternative--which calls for
""more rapid growth in money""--than under alternative B.

1971-03-09,17,"(17) If short-term rates do not rise over the next few weeks, the
staff would expect long-term market yields to work down, given the present
wide spread of long over short rates, once headway is made in absorbing the
exceptionally large volume of corporate bonds in the immediate offing. In the
corporate and municipal bond market the recent rise in yields has probably
reflected some discounting of potential future rate increases. Thus, a rise in
short-rates of about the magnitude indicated for alternative B might not be
accompanied by any appreciable rise in long rates over the second quarter as a
whole, although an initial market reaction would be likely; money market
tightening of the degree contemplated under alternative C might well bring a
more lasting long-term rate advance.

be growing at around an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate on average in May, but
in subsequent months through the summer the growth rate may move down to
around 7 per cent on average. Growth in M2 may be affected somewhat
sooner by the higher funds rate, and over time the growth rate may diminish
by about a percentage point relative to alternative A. Only a minor slow-
ing in the credit proxy is projected, as CD growth may be sustained, if not
enhanced, as tighter money market conditions lead to anticipatory borrow-
ing by banks.
","Alternative B, alternative A"
1971-06-08,17,"(17) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction
in terms of desired growth rates for the monetary and credit aggregates
(subject to any constraints that might be imposed by developments in
capital markets), and (b) to adopt as targets for the time being the
growth rates discussed earlier in connection with alternative B.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
moderate growth in monetary [DEL: and credit] aggregates over the months
ahead, taking account of [DEL: the current Treasury financing,]
developments in capital markets [DEL: , and uncertainities in foreign
exchange markets]. System open market operations until the
next meeting of the Committee shall be [DEL: aimed initially at]
[DEL: maintianing currently prevailing money market conditions,
and thereafter] conducted with a view to maintaining bank
reserves and money market conditions consistent with the
[DEL: above cited] THOSE objectives.""
It is proposed to use the phrase ""to moderate growth in monetary aggregates
in the months ahead"" as a summary description of the objective for the
aggregates, deleting the words ""and credit"", on the assumption that the
Committee will not view recent rates of growth in the adjusted proxy as
so large as to require moderation.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1971-08-24,17,"(17) Alternative C, as noted earlier, differs from B only with
respect to the indicated operating techniques. This alternative is provided
in the event the FOMC may wish to move in the direction recommended by the
Committee on the Directive. If the public appetite for demand as against
time deposits proves different from that assumed in the alternative B
specifications, for example, the Committee might nevertheless wish to provide
only the quantity of reserves consistent with those projections. In that
event, the market would have to adjust for any resultant reserve excess or
deficiency. This would imply the possibility of significantly larger
changes in money market conditions, however,  and^ the Committee may wish to set
outside limits of acceptable variation in the Federal funds rate--perhaps
a band of plus or minus one percentage point around the 4-3/4 per cent
midpoint of the funds rate range specified under alternative B.
","Alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1971-11-16,17,"(17) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible use
if the Committee decides to place more emphasis on money market conditions
than on the aggregates and wishes to call for maintenance of the conditions
""that have evolved since the discount rate reduction"", subject to a proviso
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to achieve
moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over te months
ahead.] System open market operations until the next meeting of the
Committee shall be conducted with a view to [DEL: achieving bank reserve
and] MAINTAINING THE money market conditions [DEL: consistent with that
objective, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financings.]
that have evolved since the discount rate reduction; provided that
somewhat easier conditions shall be sought if it appears that the
monetary and credit aggregates are falling significantly below
the growth paths expected.""
If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the
money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as
a description of the conditions to be maintained, and for purposes
of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed
earlier in connection with alternative A as the ""expected"" paths.
The proviso clause has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against
significant shortfalls but not excesses, on the assumption that the
Committee would not want money market conditions to be tightened in the
coming period if the aggregates should appear to be expanding on paths
above those projected, which involve no growth over the fourth quarter for
M1 and relatively low growth rates for M2 and the bank credit proxy.
","Alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1972-02-15,17,"(17) For the proviso clause in alternative B, the Committee may
wish to consider a range of fluctuation for the Federal funds rate as large
as 2 percentage points, as recommended by the report of the Committee on the
Directive. If the Committee were to adopt as targets the aggregates of
pattern II, for example, this would mean widening the funds rate range from
more restrictive on either the up or down side, or both, depending on the
extent to which the Committee may wish to emphasize interest rates relative
to aggregate objectives.

","alternative B"
1972-06-19,17,"(17) Deletion of the reference to capital market develop-
ments is proposed for alternatives A and B in view of the recent and
prospective moderation of credit demands in capital markets. However,
the Committee might wish to consider including such a reference in
association with alternative C because of the stronger upward pressures
in long-term markets that could develop under that alternative.

1972-07-18,17,"(17) Alternative A.
""To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: possible] THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments
in capital markets, and international developments, the Com-
mittee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-
ditions that will support [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT FASTER growth
in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.""
","Alternative A"
1972-09-19,17,"(17) Recent investor hesitancy and a still relatively large
overhang of dealer bill positions suggest that credit market conditions
remain quite sensitive to indications of change in monetary policy. A
rise in the Federal funds rate to somewhat above 5 per cent, as contemplated
in alternatives B or C, would very likely lead to further upward adjustments
in short-term rates, with the 3-month bill rate moving up in a 4-3/4--5-1/2
per cent range. Short rate increases would be greater under alternative C
than under B, and the probability of reviving expectations of a discount
rate increase would also be commensurately greater. Long-term market rates
would probably rise somewhat, particularly if a rising funds rate were
viewed as the beginning of a more sustained tightening in monetary policy.
Upward market rate adjustments would, of course, be quite sharp under
alternative D.
Prooosed directives
","alternative C"
1972-10-17,17,"(17) In alternatives A and B, which call, respectively, for
""somewhat more"" and ""more"" moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the
months ahead, it is proposed to add the phrase ""than recorded in the third
quarter."" This addition is proposed in the interest of clarity, since the
long-run monetary growth rates specified under these alternatives, while
below the third-quarter rates, are equal to or above those recorded in
August and September.

in the funds rate, should one be required, is before the end of January. A
rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative B
would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short-term rates generally,
with the 3-month Treasury bill rate in particular moving upward in a
(14) At such market rates, demand for member bank borrowings
would be relatively strong, even with the discount rate at the recently
announced 5 per cent level, and the level of borrowings might be around $1
billion on average. However, as borrowings continue large,many banks will wear
out their welcome at the window and this will add further to pressure on
open market rates and on banks to restrict acquisitions of loans and
(15) Efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates
of alternative C are likely to entail an even greater firming of money
market conditions, with the Federal funds rate probably moving well
above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting. The 3-month bill
rate would likely rise into the 5-3/4--6 per cent area, if not by the
time of the next meeting then by early March when additional cash borrowing
through tax bill offerings may be anticipated. If short-term rates attain
these levels, there may be a rather marked dampening in flows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits, which could eventually call into question
the viability of current Regulation Q ceilings on such deposits.
(16) If the Committee were to opt to restrain growth in
reserves and monetary aggregates with the result that money market
conditions firmed, even-keel considerations would again be a constraint
on the timing of policy actions. Sufficient time has been given for
distribution of the recent long-term bond offering so that it no longer
appears to require special consideration. However, on January 31 the
Treasury will announce terms for refunding $4.8 billion of publicly-held
obligations that mature in mid-February. It is too early to have an
idea as to the nature of the refunding, although it does seem unlikely
at this point that new cash will need to be raised or that the Treasury
will wish to offer another long bond so close to the recent offering.
Thus, a relatively conventional exchange with short- and intermediate-term
options seems most likely.
(17) However that may be, a significant tightening of the
money market between late January and mid-February seems precluded if the
Committee wishes to adhere to previous even-keel standards. Some slight
upward drift in money market rates would not necessarily be ruled out,
depending on the psychological atmosphere around the refunding, but the
great bulk of any tightening, should it be required, would have to be
accomplished within the next two weeks.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1973-02-13,17,"(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to
delete the reference to Treasury financing because the current financ-
ing will be substantially completed by the date of the Committee's
meeting. Retention of the reference to credit market developments is
proposed only for alternative C, the only alternative that contemplates
a significant tightening of the money market. A reference to inter-
national developments is suggested for the three alternatives because
of the possibility that exchange market speculation, if continued,
could have disturbing effects on market psychology generally, alter
cash and liquidity demands, and/or distort the interest rate structure.

alternative C and more under alternative A. Under alternative C, the
funds rate is expected to rise into the upper part of a 10 to 12-1/2
per cent range between now and mid-September. The wider range specified
under this alternative reflects what we presume to be an icreasing diffi-

high market interest rates to savers. We would expect this tendency
to continue even under alternative A, so that M2 growth over the second and

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-06-16,17,"(17) Near-term tightening in the money market of the magnitude
suggested for alternative C would almost certainly lead to a fairly
sharp reaction in other short-term markets and to an upward adjustment
in long-term rates. It could even engender expectations of a rise in
the discount rate from its current 6 per cent level. Some adverse impact
on savings flows to banks and intermediaries could be expected, but short-
term rates--typified perhaps by a 3-month bill rate around 6 3/2 per cent--
would not be likely to rise so high as to sharply curtail such inflows.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1975-09-16,17,"(17) Alternative B contemplates a modest tightening of money
market conditions between now and the next Committee meeting, as
indicated by the 6-3/4 per cent mid-point of a 6-7 per cent Federal
funds rate range. As in the other alternatives, additional tightening
would appear to be necessary later this year and early next year. The
staff has assumed that the Federal funds rate under this alternative
would probably rise to the 7 -8 per cent area by late fall. This
particular funds rate pattern would be consistent with a one-year growth
rate for M1 between QII '75 and QII '76 of 6-3/4 per cent. Given the
downward revision of $1.2 billion in the average level of M1 in the
second quarter of 1975, such a growth rate would result in the same
average level of M1 in the second quarter of 1976 as was implied by the
Proposed directive

1976-01-20,17,"(17) Alternative C assumes that the Federal funds rate is adjusted
upward over the next few weeks to the middle of a 5-6 per cent range. This
approach is most consistent with a reduction in the longer-run growth
ranges. If the FOMC were to seek one-year growth in the aggregates as
indexed by M1 expansion of about 5¼ per cent from QIV '75 to QIV '76, the
staff believes that the funds rate would have to rise further to around 7¼
per cent by summer.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1976-07-19,17,"(17) Increases in bond yields over the balance of the year are
expected to be relatively small. Business and other credit demands on
banks can be expected to strengthen somewhat over the second half as inven-
tory and fixed capital expenditures increase and long-term borrowing slows.
Under alternative B, and especially under C, banks would be likely to reduce
their acquisitions of Treasury securities and to borrow in CD and Eurodollar
markets. Under alternative A, inflows of other deposits should reduce the
need for banks to rely on such sources of funds over the balance of the

""Money Market"" Proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks
to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over
the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear
to be growing at about the rates currently expected.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1977-04-19,17,"(17) Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal funds
rate between now and the next Committee meeting to around 5¼ per cent,
the mid-point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent range. Such a funds rate increase at
this time may be accompanied by a rise in bill rates of roughly the same
magnitude over the next few weeks. The extent of adjustment in bill,
as well as longer-term, rates will depend in large part on the market's
assessment of the interest rate outlook and on the market's technical
condition. At present, dealer positions are relatively low, particularly
in the coupon area, and this would tend to moderate upward interest
rate adjustments. On the other hand, if many market participants
do not expect the Fed to let the money market tighten at this time,
evidence of a tightening could cause a more substantial market reaction.
","Alternative C"
1977-07-19,17,"(17) If the Committee wishes to achieve the midpoints of the
longer-run growth ranges for alternative C--indexed by an M-1 range of
only a little further and would top out at around 6¼ per cent in the first
quarter of 1978. The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates
over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest
rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting.
The funds rate may rise to around 6½ per cent in the first quarter of next
year and probably further to a level of 6¾ per cent by the second quarter.
","alternative C"
1977-08-16,17,"(17) The easing in the money market envisioned under alternative
A may stimulate rather substantial downward adjustments over the short-run
in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates, particularly in the
Treasury securities market where dealers may be expected to make efforts
to cover short positions. The staff would not expect that downward rate
movements could be sustained, however. Given the projected strength in
nominal GNP and money demand between now and mid-1978, interest rates would
probably once again begin rising by early fall--with the funds rate under
this alternative peaking at around 7¼ per cent in the second quarter of
Directive language
","alternative
A"
1978-02-28,17,"(18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise
over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent
range, and the February-March annual rate of growth of M-1 and M-2 would
likely be in 1/2 to 5-1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges, respec-
tively. The 3-month Treasury bill rate would probably rise to about 7
per cent by mid-March, with commensurate adjustments in other short rates.
Member bank borrowings could be expected to rise sharply once again,
increasing pressures for a discount rate increase. At the same time,
the rise in short-term interest rates associated with this alternative
would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets.
","alternative C"
1978-06-20,17,"(17) Projections of the Federal funds rate over the four-
quarter policy period are shown in Appendix I. Under Alternative A,
the Federal funds rate might need to rise to 9 to 10 per cent by fall
to restrain growth in the aggregates to within the longer-run ranges.
Under Alternative B, restraint would be introduced earlier and, as a
result, the level of the funds rate required in late 1978 and early
jections assume a resumption of a downward shift in money demand.1/
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
1979-02-06,17,"(17) The staff believes that if the 13-1/4 per cent annual
rate of growth of nominal GNP projected for the current quarter
develops, it will call forth a substantial increase in M-1 in
February-March. Under alternative II, M-1 is projected to increase
in a range centered on a 7 per cent annual rate, which would put M-1
just below the midpoint of the alternative B long-run path by March.
Even such a resurgence in growth would bring the growth rate of M-1
for the first quarter (quarterly average basis) to only a 3/4 per cent
annual rate, and would imply another substantial increase in V-1,
2/
at about a 12 per cent annual rate, as shown in Appendix II.
","alternative B"
1979-03-20,17,"(17) Under alternative B, bond yields can be expected to fluctuate
in a fairly narrow range. The volume of oncoming supplies in the municipal
market is likely to rise from the recent pace, but the corporate new
issue calendar remains quite modest. Moreover, the Treasury is entering
a period of seasonally light coupon financing activity. It is expected
to raise about $2 billion of new money in early April through sale of a
to borrow only about $1 billion of additional new money in the coupon
market until June. While there appears to be little reason to expect any
significant rise in bond market rates under alternative B, the projected
slowing of deposit flows at thrift institutions suggests that primary
mortgage yields may edge higher in coming weeks.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1979-05-22,17,"(17) Alternative A calls for a decline in the funds rate over
the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9 to 10 per cent range.
Growth in M-1 and M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 1 to 5
and 4½ to 8½ per cent, respectively. An easing action at this time would
be unexpected by the market and hence could induce a sharp decline in
short-term interest rates. On the other hand, market concerns about the
inflationary outlook might moderate the impact of an easing action on
longer-term yields. Similar concerns might also induce some weakness of
the dollar in exchange markets.

1979-07-11,17,"(17) As illustrated by the top panel of the chart on page 14,
growth in measured M-1 at the 4-1/2 percent midpoint of its projected
July-August alternative II range would leave M-1 in the upper half of
its current longer-run range. The lower panel of the chart compares
the projected July-August expansion with the proposed alternative B
longer-run range. In that comparison, by August M-1 would be in the
lower half of the longer-run range. The dotted line in the chart also
shows annual growth rates needed from the actual June level to reach
targeted midpoint levels by the fourth quarter of 1979 under the
current longer-run range and proposed alternative B; these growth rates

1979-11-20,17,"(17) The specifications of alternative C involve slower growth
in the monetary aggregates than alternative B, as indicated in the table
in paragraph (11). Such growth rates would be consistent with expansion
in the monetary base and total reserves over November-December at annual
rates of 7 and 6 percent, respectively. Given the expected demand for
money, this alternative is likely to be associated with either no change
or some rise in market rates. On the assumption that adoption of this
alternative would mean that the Committee desires greater assurance that
growth rates for the aggregates will not be excessive, the upper limit of
the proposed funds rate range has been raised slightly from that of
alternative B. Consistent with such an approach, the nonborrowed reserve
path for this alternative has been constructed on the assumption that
borrowings average a shade under $2 billion, implying growth in nonborrowed
reserves of around 8¾ percent over November and December--considerably
less than the alternative B pace. The funds rate initially would probably
be around 13 percent, or a bit higher, given the present discount rate. If
the discount rate were raised, in light of a continuing relatively wide gap
between the discount and federal funds rates, additional nonborrowed reserves
would have to be provided unless the Committee wished to tolerate further
upward pressures on market rates--a decision that might depend in part
on the behavior at the time of monetary aggregates, total reserves, and
the monetary base.
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative B, alternative B"
1980-01-08,17,"(17) The recent relatively slow growth of M-1 raises the possi-
bility that the record level of interest rates following the October 6
program may have induced another round of one-time shifts out of existing
money balances. Even if any such shift has about run its course,
demands for cash in the first quarter of 1980 may still be fairly weak,
given the less than 5 percent annual rate of increase in nominal GNP that
is projected for that period. Thus, achievement of the 6 percent annual
growth rate for M-1 over the first quarter in alternative A--which appears to
involve increases of about 8 and 3 percent in the monetary base and total
reserves, respectively--may be accompanied by relatively substantial
declines of interest rates from current levels.
","alternative A"
1980-02-04,17,"(17) The easing of money and credit demands in the second
quarter, when the economy is projected to weaken more substantially than
in the first, enhances the probability of some decline of interest rates
at that time, particularly if the Committee were to opt for the slight
acceleration in M-1A growth over the March to June period to the 5½ percent
annual rate proposed in alternative B. Such growth would bring M-1A by
June to around the mid-point of a 3½ to 6½ percent target band for 1980.
The charts on the next two pages show actual growth rates in all of the
monetary aggregates through January, and projected growth rates based on
the proposed short-run alternatives, in relation to longer-run targets for
of longer-run alternative II.1/
","alternative B"
1980-03-18,17,"(17) The immediate decline in money market rates that could
develop under alternative A might be viewed by the markets as inconsistent
with the new anti-inflation program. Under that interpretation, the
dollar might weaken on foreign exchange markets; in addition, any
tendency of the bond markets to rally would be limited by continued
inflationary expectations. The short-term rate decline under this alterna-
tive over the next few weeks is not likely to be large enough to make any
significant difference for thrift deposit flows, and mortgage markets would
continue taut.
","alternative A"
1980-04-22,17,"(17) Alternative C would probably require growth in total
reserves at about a 4 percent annual rate. Assuming an initial level of
borrowings of around $2 billion, gradually declining over the quarter to
$1 to $11 billion, nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 16 percent
annual rate from March to June. This alternative, however, is more likely
to induce borrowing under the new temporary seasonal credit program, thereby
requiring a downward adjustment in the nonborrowed reserves path.
","Alternative C"
1980-07-09,17,"(17) Of the three short-run alternatives, alternative B would
probably have the least effect on market rates of interest over the forth-
coming intermeeting period. Even under this alternative, however, there
might be some further upward pressure on interest rates if the market
comes to feel that monetary policy will have to begin restraining money
growth or that fiscal policy will be turning more expansionary. In any
event, Treasury borrowing needs appear rather substantial over the months
ahead. Mortgage rates are likely to decline only a bit further, particu-
larly if short rates stabilize or back up some and thrift institutions
become concerned about the cost and magnitude of future deposit inflows.
Looking toward the fall of the year, it appears more likely that interest
rates would be under some upward pressure, as nominal GNP growth-and
accompanying money and credit demands-accelerates. If, however, the
public's transactions demand for money remains on the low side relative
to GNP, upward interest rate pressures could be quite minimal.
","alternative B"
1980-12-18,17,"(17) Under alternative B, the federal funds rate might be expected
to drop over the forthcoming intermeeting period to around 17 percent, and
probably by more later in the quarter, unless the economy proves to be
stronger than expected. A 17 percent funds rate would imply borrowing in
a range of $1¼ to $1 billion, given the present discount rate structure. A
drop in the funds rate to this level would be accompanied by declines of 2
percentage points or so in very short rates. Intermediate- and longer-term
market rates would drop substantially initially, partly as short positions
are covered. Rate declines may be more limited over the longer run, as
markets face adverse expectational pressures associated with sharp increases
that may be published in the consumer price index and with discussion of a
deficit-expanding tax cut. Even before such a tax cut becomes a reality,
debt markets will be burdened with heavy federal financing requirements--
expected to run between $20 and $25 billion in the first quarter. The long-
term bond markets will, in addition, be called upon to absorb a massive
backlog of corporate and municipal offerings that have been awaiting a down-
turn in rates.
","alternative B"
1981-02-02,17,"(17) The aggregate specifications of alternative A would appear
to involve growth in total reserves at a 1/1½ percent annual rate from January
to March, and, as noted earlier, only a small decline, if any, in the funds
rate from the recent trading range of 17 to 19 percent. While an average
level of borrowing at the discount window of about $1¼ billion might be
associated with attainment of the alternative A specifications, borrowing
demands have been erratic recently--with the funds rate first staying high
as borrowing declined and then falling as borrowing rose. Over the next
two months total reserve growth under alternative B would be only percent
at an annual rate and reserves would decline at a 3 percent annual rate
under alternative C. Under both alternatives relatively more reserves
would be expected to be provided through borrowing at the discount window,
given the current discount rate structure and assuming that these alterna-
tives involve some upward short-term interest rate pressure. Under
alternative 3, borrowing might be $1½ billion, or a little less, and under
alternative C $1¾ billion or a little more.
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative B, alternative C, alternative C"
1982-02-01,17,"(17) The alternative B specifications would entail little change
in total reserves over the period from January to March. Assuming adjustment
borrowing of around $1 billion, nonborrowed reserves would decline at a
in the intermeeting period would likely fluctuate in a 13½ to 14½ percent
range.1/ Demands for short-term credit are likely to remain quite strong
over the balance of the quarter, with businesses continuing to avoid the
bond market at the relatively high rate levels likely to prevail over the
near-term under this alternative.
","alternative B"
1982-08-24,17,"(17) In the fourth quarter of the year, interest rates may be
under upward pressure as compared with levels anticipated between now and
September in either alternative A or B. Nominal GNP growth is expected to
be maintained at close to the third-quarter rate in part because of lagged
effects of the recent tax cut. And in the degree that the quantity of
money demanded is also increased from the lagged effects of recent short-
term rate declines there will be a greater likelihood that a rebound in
short-term rates would result from efforts to constrain money growth to
the upper end of the longer-run M1 range, with the odds on a rebound
greater under alternative A than alternative B. To the extent that the
Committee is willing to tolerate growth for the year above the 5-1/2 per-
cent limit--say, at around 6 percent--the chances of a rate rebound would
be diminished. The table below shows fourth quarter M1 growth rates for
alternative 1982 M1 outcomes, given the two current short-term policy
alternatives. In any event growth in M2 and M3 for the year seems likely
to be fractionally above the Committee's ranges.

Directive language
Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the
directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on June 30 -
July 1 are shown in strike-through form. Deletion of the second
qualifying sentence is proposed since it no longer seems relevant.
However, the first qualifying sentence still appears to be germane,
particularly in light of the current strength of M2.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from June to September
at annual rates of about [DEL:5] ____ percent and about 9 ____ percent
respectively. Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable depending
on evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to
exceptional liquidity demands and changes in financial asset holdings.
[DEL: It was also noted that seasonal uncertainties, together with increased
social security payments and the initial impact of the tax cut on cash
balances, might lead toa temporary bulge in the monetary aggregates,
particularly-M1.] The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if
it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the
monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before
the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate
persistently outside a range of [DEL: 10 to 15] ____ TO ____ percent.
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B"
1982-10-05,17,"(17) Alternative A, which targets M1 growth at a 5 percent and
M2 at a 9-1/2 percent annual rate from September to December, would probably
accommodate an easing in money market conditions over the months ahead.
The funds rate might fall to around 9 to 9-1/2 percent, with total reserves
rising at an 8 percent annual rate during the final three months of the
year. At the current discount rate, adjustment (plus seasonal) borrowing
would fall to frictional levels of $150 million or less, and nonborrowed
reserves would expand at a 15 percent annual rate. The market would come
to expect a further drop in the discount rate.
","Alternative A"
1982-12-20,17,"(17) Alternative C involves slower growth in the monetary
aggregates than alternatives A or B, with M2 growth specified at 10 percent
over the first quarter. This would probably require restraining total
reserve growth to about a 4 percent annual rate, and nonborrowed reserve
growth by even more to a one percent rate. Borrowing would probably be
around $700 million.
","Alternative C"
1983-03-28,17,"(17) Short-term interest rates may decline considerably under
alternative A, as market fears of any near-term tightening are allayed
and current dealer financing costs drop along with the funds rate. The
short-term rates would lead to a further decline in the bank prime rate.
Longer-term rates may also decline, but the declines may be limited by
a resultant step-up in corporate bond offerings.
","alternative A"
1983-05-24,17,"(17) M2 growth under alternative B is anticipated to be around
a 9 percent annual rate over May and June on average. Growth in the non-
transactions component of that aggregate is expected to pick up, after
having been depressed in April by IRA-Keogh transfers. Growth in M3 is
likely to be held down by CD run-offs at banks, as loan demand--particu-
larly from businesses--remains soft, and by declines in the assets of
institution-only money market funds, though at a slower pace than in
recent months.
","alternative B"
1983-08-23,17,"(17) Alternative C contemplates a near-term tightening in
money market conditions with a view to gaining greater assurance that
all of the aggregates, including Ml, would end 1983 within their longer-
run ranges. The federal funds rate under alternative C might trade in
the 10 to 10-1/2 per cent range through the end of the quarter. Discount
window borrowing would tend toward the area of $l-1/4 billion at the
current 8-1/2 per cent discount rate, raising questions about the level
of that rate. Assuming no discount rate change, nonborrowed reserves
might decline at about a 6 per cent annual rate from July to September.
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1983-12-19,17,"(17) Alternative B--which involves continuation of prevailing
bank reserve and money market conditions-contemplates growth in M2 and
M1 that would place these aggregates at around the midpoints of their
tentative longer-run ranges by March. The specified M2 growth of 8 percent
at an annual rate for the November-to-March period would be consistent with
an expected pick-up in M1 growth from the pace of recent months offset by a
slowing in expansion of nontransaction deposits; the latter may have been
boosted to a small extent in October and November by the effects of deposit

rate deregulation. Expansion of M3 is likely to slow somewhat over the
November-to-March period from its average pace since summer, perhaps in-
creasing at a rate a bit below the top of the FOMC's tentative longer-run
range. Credit growth at banks and particularly at thrifts is likely to be
slower in the first quarter than over recent months, working to limit demands
for managed liabilities by depository institutions.
","Alternative B"
1984-01-30,17,"(17) Borrowing at the discount window under alternative B would
be expected to range around $650 million, and federal funds to remain in
the 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent area. However, with contemporaneous reserve
requirements being instituted on February 2, reserve paths will have to
take account of transitional and more permanent adaptations by banks in their
reserve management strategies that could affect, among other things, patterns
of borrowing and excess reserves. Reserve paths in the initial stage of CRR
implementation would probably need to allow for higher than average excess
reserves. By March, however, excess reserves may be closer to ""normal,"" and
on that assumption growth in total reserves over the next two months is
likely to be around 5 percent under alternative B. Nonborrowed reserve
growth, assuming borrowing settles down around $650 million, would increase
at a 6 percent annual rate.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1984-03-26,17,"(17) Alternative C involves a more restrictive policy than
either A or B--slowing M1 growth, for example, over the March-to-June
period to about 5 percent at an annual rate, which would place it at
about the middle of its longer-run range by mid-year. M2 growth would
remain relatively restrained and this aggregate would stay in the lower
part of its long-run range. Discount window borrowing might rise to
around $1-1/2 billion over the intermeeting period, with nonborrowed
reserves falling at a 4 percent annual rate.
","Alternative C"
1984-07-16,17,"(18) The deceleration of M1 growth under alternative B is
not expected to be accompanied by any significant slowing of M2 from its
rate of growth of the previous three months. Growth of the latter
aggregate is likely to be sustained, given the projected reasonably
strong growth in personal income and assuming little change in the
personal savings rate. Somewhat more rapid expansion in the nontrans-
actions component is expected, partly reflecting a lagged response of
the public to the increased rate attractiveness of time deposits and
MMDAs relative to demand deposits and regular NOW accounts. However,
expansion of M3 over the summer might well slow from its unusually
rapid second-quarter pace. Banks may have less need to issue CDs as
merger-related financing demands are reduced, and in any event the
recent tightening of markets and widening of yield spreads against
banks might encourage a somewhat less aggressive posture by banks in
credit markets. Even so, with the economy and underlying credit demands
expected to be fairly strong, M3 growth would probably be high relative
to its long-run range.
","alternative B"
1984-12-17,17,"(17) Proposed language for the operational paragraph, with
alternatives, is shown below. The language in brackets is proposed
should the Committee wish to provide flexibility on the up side for
growth in M1 in light of the currently estimated shortfall over the
fourth quarter relative to the FOMC's original expectation for that
period, as was done in the November directive. The bracketed language
would seem to be more relevant to alternatives B or C, since alternative
A contains a growth rate for M1 from November to March that, as de-
scribed in paragraph (14), already takes more account of the shortfall.
In the implementation of policy in the short run, the
Ccmmittee seeks to reduce somewhat (alt. A)/MAINTAIN (alt. B)/
INCREASE SOMEWHAT (alt. C) existing pressures on reserve positions.
This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M1, M2, and
M3 at annual rates of around [DEL: 7-1/2 and 9] ____, ____, and ____ percent,
RESPECTIVELY, during the period from [DEL: September to December] NOVEMBER
TO MARCH. [DEL: M1 is expected to grow over the period at an annual rate
of around 3 percent, less than anticipated earlierin view of the
decline in October. In light of that decline, more rapid growth of

Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of
substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of significant
strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures. The
Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the
Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives
and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting
is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently
outside a range of [DEL: 7 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent.

A"
1985-02-12,17,"(17) A less rapid expansion in the nontransactions components
of M2 and M3 is also expected to contribute to a slowdown in growth in the
broader monetary aggregates under alternative B. Weakness in inflows to
MMMFs is already evident in the most recent data, as yields on these
assets have declined into fairly close alignment with the lower level
of market interest rates; a similar pattern for MMDAs can be expected as
their offering rates continue to drop in response to previous declines in
other yields. As more normal rate alignments are restored, M2 growth
should slow considerably. However, M2 velocity in the first quarter
would decline at around a 4 percent annual rate under alternative B, owing
mostly to the surge in growth of this aggregate around year-end. M3 growth
is expected to be held down by continued moderate bank CD issuance as
well as weakness in institution-only money funds.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1985-03-26,17,"(17) Under alternative C, the 5 percent pace of M1 growth from
March to June would keep this aggregate below the upper limit of the
band. And the slower growth specified for M2 and M3 would place both of
these aggregates within their respective long-run cones in June. Such a
deceleration of money growth would likely involve a significant tighten-
ing of reserve conditions. Borrowing might increase to around $750 mil-
lion, and the federal funds rate would probably rise to around 9-1/2
percent. Nonborrowed and total reserves would increase at 4-1/2 and 7
percent annual rates, respectively.
","alternative C"
1985-08-20,17,"(17) Alternative A involves an easing of pressures on bank
reserve positions, either through a reduction in borrowings to the $100
to $200 million area or by a drop in the discount rate of, say, 1/2
percentage point with a smaller or no accompanying decline in borrowing.
The federal funds rate would drop toward 7 percent, and the decline in
the dollar on foreign exchange markets would accelerate. Long- and short-
term interest rates would retrace their recent rise and probably fall
still further, although the drop in long-term rates may be damped by
the implications for inflation and for foreign interest in U.S. securities
of a substantial weakening of the dollar.
","Alternative A"
1985-10-01,17,"(17) Alternative C assumes some tightening of reserve conditions
consistent with a marked slowing of M1 growth over the next three months
to around a 5-1/2 percent annual rate and with enough moderation of M2 growth
possibly to move just within the target range for the year. Borrowing is
assumed to average $650 to $750 million, with federal funds moving up to
around 8-1/2 percent. Such a firming of policy would tend to surprise
markets. The 3-month bill rate might rise to around 7-3/4 percent, and
bond yields would also show a substantial increase, particularly during
the Treasury financing periods. Private interest rates may rise somewhat
more than comparable Treasury yields because of market concerns about the
health of certain sectors and financial institutions. Some upward pressure
on the exchange value of the dollar may also be expected, partly as the
efficacy of intervention operations in that context is brought into
question. However, more favorable investor attitudes toward the dollar
would be tempered if expectations about U.S. economic activity worsened
in the wake of higher interest rates.
Directive language
","Alternative C"
1986-02-11,17,"(17) Given recent behavior of the aggregates, alternatives A and
B are reasonably consistent with the short-run ranges from November to March
adopted at the last meeting-7 to 9 percent annual rate of growth for M1 and
than A relative to those ranges. The differences in the alternatives in
that context would be reflected in the degree of near-term bank reserve
pressures--with alternative B assuming unchanged pressures and alternative A
some easing--and implications for the trajectory of money growth over the
months ahead relative to longer-run ranges. In the tightening alternative C,
both M1 and M2 would be expected to fall short of the December meeting ranges.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1986-04-01,17,"(17) M1 growth under the money market and reserve conditions
of alternative C would be expected to slow over the March to June period,
bringing this aggregate to within its long-run range by June. However,
M2 would remain noticeably below the lower end of its long-run range,
though within its parallel band. Moreover, if growth of M2 within its
longer-run range for the year is to be attained, the higher level of
rates is likely to prove unsustainable, particularly if it worked to
restrain economic expansion significantly.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1987-03-31,17,"(17) A rise in interest rates would limit the extent of the pick-
up in M2--as opportunity costs of holding M2 balances widened. Given the
weakness of this aggregate in the first quarter, which may have reflected
shifts in portfolio preferences, alternative C would tend to bring M2
farther below the lower end of its long-run range over the second quarter.
Slower expansion of assets at banks and thrifts would act to restrain M3
growth to along the lower end of its long-run range. Growth in its M1
component would be expected to remain subdued but still be above that of
Directive language
","alternative C"
1987-08-18,17,"(17) The backup in short-term market rates under alternative C,
together with lagging returns on deposits, would widen opportunity costs of
holding liquid monetary assets. Expansion of M2 over August and September
would be expected to average 5-1/4 percent, bringing growth from the fourth
quarter through September to around 4 percent. Given the continuing effects
of the rise in interest rates, this aggregate would be unlikely to accelerate
much in the fourth quarter. The 6-3/4 percent growth anticipated for M3 over
the last two months of this quarter would imply that growth of this aggregate
from the fourth quarter base to September would be around 1/4 percentage
point below the lower limit of its 1987 range. Even so, this aggregate
could climb to the lower end of its range in the fourth quarter, assuming
continued moderate expansion of assets at depository institutions. M1
might expand at only a 3 percent rate from June to September under this
alternative, with growth for the year decelerating further to 6-1/4 percent
by September, and dropping noticeably below 6 percent for the year.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1987-11-03,17,"(17) Under alternative A, long-term bond yields would likely
continue to decline as market perceptions of impending weakness in the
economy tended to work against a revival of inflation concerns. However,
should the dollar fall precipitously on foreign exchange markets or the
further easing of policy be seen at some point as imparting substantial
strength to the outlook for the economy or prices, any drop in long-term
yields might be quite limited. While downward pressure on the dollar
could well intensify under this alternative, foreign central banks might
be more likely to ease monetary policies as the outlook for their export
industries weakens further.
","alternative A"
1987-12-15,17,"(17) The higher interest rates of alternative C can be expected to
prevent M2 from accelerating much from its recent pace. M3 growth could
slow somewhat, especially as money funds experienced outflows when mar-
ket rates rose. In March, M2 would be well below, and M3 somewhat
above, the lower bounds of their tentative 1988 ranges. Given its rela-
tively greater interest sensitivity, M1 would probably grow at only a 2
percent rate through March, well below its average growth to date this
Directive language
","alternative C"
1988-02-09,17,"(17) Under the specifications of alternative B, M2 would be
expected to grow in February and March at nearly a 7 percent annual rate, a
little above the average pace of December and January. On a quarterly
average basis, growth would accelerate from 4 percent in the fourth quarter
to 6-1/4 percent in the current quarter as the response of demand to the
drop in interest rates since October more than offsets the effects of slower
income growth. Consequently, M2 velocity would decline at around a 1 per-
cent rate--the first drop in more than a year. From its fourth-quarter
base, M2 by March would advance at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate, the midpoint
of its tentative long-run range. Within M2, rate relationships would tend
to increase the attractiveness of the more liquid interest-earning com-
ponents owing to the stickier adjustment of their offering rates following
the recent declines in market rates. From the fourth quarter, M1 by March
would rise at a 5-3/4 percent rate.
","alternative B"
1988-11-01,17,"(17) Under alternative C, M2 would expand at only a 2 percent
rate over the remainder of the year. This aggregate would be well below
the lower end of its provisional range at the beginning of 1989 and
given the lagged effect of the change in interest rates, growth would
remain quite damped for a while. Wider opportunity costs would reduce
inflows to retail accounts, and M1 balances would contract. M3 still
would continue to strengthen under this alternative--the pickup, though,
being limited by rate-induced outflows from money funds--and enter 1989
well within its tentative range.
Directive Language
","alternative C"
1989-08-22,17,"(17) Alternative C, by widening opportunity costs on liquid
balances, would tend to retard M2 growth to a 4-1/2 percent rate in Sep-
tember. If rates remained at the higher level associated with this
alternative, little pickup in M2 growth would be anticipated in the fourth
quarter, despite the waning impact of the effects of the thrift resolu-
tion. For the year, M2 likely would grow at a 3-3/4 percent rate. The
lower interest rates of alternative A could boost M2 growth to a 7-1/2
percent rate in September, and, with comparable growth in the fourth
quarter, to 4-3/4 percent for the year. By contrast, with both M3 and
debt much less responsive to variations in short-term rates, their annual
growth rates are unlikely to differ appreciably from those consistent with
the flat interest rates in the staff forecast.
Directive Language:
","Alternative C, alternative A"
1989-12-18,17,"(17) Alternative C would restrain M2 growth to around the upper
bound of its 1990 growth cone by March, putting it on a track toward the
middle of its tentative range; such a move would seem to increase the odds
on more noticeable progress toward price stability, with assistance from a
stronger dollar, albeit with greater risk of an economic downturn. The
accompanying slowdown in M3--to an expected 5 percent annual rate over the
November-to-March period--would cause this aggregate to drift downward in
the lower half of its tentative 1990 growth range. A tightening of policy
would come as a surprise to market participants, and short-term interest
rates would rise by more than the 50 basis point increase in the federal
funds rate. Bond rates initially would rise, though this increase might
be retraced if markets came to see the move as part of a longer-term
strategy to restrain spending and prices. An aspect of this restraint
would be a transition period that involved a weaker outlook for profits,
downward pressure on various asset prices, and an intensification of
strains in certain vulnerable areas of the financial system, with
implications for intermediaries and other lenders.
Directive Language
","Alternative C"
1991-03-26,17,"(17) Under alternative A, M2 would strengthen to a 6-1/2 percent
rate over the March-to-June period. The pickup would be concentrated in
retail liquid accounts as their opportunity costs fell further. By June,
this aggregate would be well into the upper half of its annual range. M3
would expand at a 4 percent rate over this period, buoyed by larger
inflows to money funds and by some spillover of the strength in M2.
","alternative A"
1991-12-17,17,"(17) The lower short-term interest rates associated with
alternative A would put M2 on a path that would carry it toward the
middle portion of its range later in 1992. This impetus would be
supplied in the first months of the year by lower opportunity costs of
holding money, and later by the boost to income flows from the decline
in interest rates. From November to March, M2 is projected to turn in a
be wholly concentrated in liquid deposits, which should respond to the
narrowing of their opportunity costs. While deposit rates will be
reduced further--perhaps appreciably at some institutions, if lower
market rates jolt them into reassessing long-standing rates on NOW
accounts and passbook savings--they are not likely to drop enough to
eliminate the additional stimulus to money growth of the lower interest
rates in alternative A. The induced pickup of inflows to liquid depos-
its should more than offset greater outflows from small time deposits
and M2-MMMF shares into capital market instruments with increasingly
attractive relative returns. The faster M2 growth under alternative A
will show through to M3, though in muted form, since bank and thrift
credit growth will accelerate by less than M2 in the short run.
Directive Language
","alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1992-11-17,17,"(17) Under alternative B, the growth of M2 is projected to
slow somewhat from its pace of the last two months. Special factors are
continuing to boost M2 growth in November but will partly reverse there-
after, pulling average growth over the five month forecast horizon back
to an underlying rate of about 2 percent. On a quarterly average
basis, the near-term pickup in M2 puts that aggregate on a growth tra-
jectory somewhat below that for nominal GDP in the fourth quarter but
sweep accounts as other checkable rather than large time
deposits adds about $4 billion to M2 from October to December but has
no further effect. M1 growth is slowing, but the lagged effects of
previous reductions in short-term market interest rates still show
clearly in the projected near double-digit expansion of the narrow
aggregates. With currency and total reserves projected at 7-3/4 and 6
percent, respectively, over these five months, the monetary base would
increase at an 8 percent rate.
about 3 percentage points below it in the first quarter of 1993. This
upward tilt to M2 velocity over the two quarters reflects a continuation
of those forces that have been boosting velocity for some time--the
ongoing process of balance-sheet restructuring and deleveraging that
makes investors less willing to acquire monetary assets and depository
institutions less willing to compete aggressively for funds.
","alternative B"
1993-05-18,17,"(17) Under alternative C, the higher money market interest
rates and opportunity costs would restrain the monetary aggregates. The
restraint on the aggregates could be limited to the degree that capital
losses on bond and stock funds prompt investors to shift back into
deposits, but on balance the tighter monetary stance should act to slow
monetary growth. M2 would expand at only a 5-1/2 percent rate over May
and June, and M3 at a 3-3/4 percent pace. The moderate upward trajec-
tory of M2 expected under unchanged interest rates later in the year
would be trimmed, with growth from June to September likely at only a
range. Maintenance of the money market conditions of alternative C
probably would induce M3 to contract on the year.
Directive language
","alternative C, alternative C"
1994-03-22,17,"(17) The pickup in M2 is projected to show through to M3.
Under alternative B, this aggregate would expand at a 1-1/2 percent
pace over the February-to-June period. Bank credit is forecast to
grow at the moderate pace of recent months, but less should be funded
through non-M3 sources. Moreover, the drag on M3 from large outflows
of institution-only money market mutual funds would end and small
inflows resume as money market rates decline some. Under alternative
C, M3 would pick up by less, expanding at a 1-1/4 percent rate over
February to June, restrained by some further outflows from M3-type
money market funds. By June, M3 would stand 1/4 percent at an annual
rate above its fourth-quarter base under alternative C, only a little
above the lower end of its annual growth cone.

1995-05-23,17,"(17) M2 growth, by contrast, is projected to edge up slight-
ly from that of the previous four months, to a 2-1/2 percent pace over
April through September; this aggregate would remain in the lower half
of its l-to-5 percent annual range under alternative B. Although
slower growth of nominal income over the second and third quarters
will damp the demand for money, opportunity costs of holding M2 assets
have leveled off and begun to fall; as the depressing effects of
earlier increases in opportunity costs diminish, M2 should grow more
closely in line with income. M2 velocity is projected to continue
(Footnote continues on next page)
to rise over the second and third quarters, but at only a 1-1/2 per-
cent average annual rate--far more slowly than the 5 percent increase
over the previous four quarters. The projected growth rate of M2
averages just a bit below predictions of the standard staff model over
the second and third quarters--consistent with the recent small pre-
diction errors of the model and the staff's judgment that deposit
rates will run below what historical patterns would suggest. Flows
into stock and bond mutual funds are expected to continue at around
the modest pace experienced over the first four months of the year,
and M2+ is forecast to expand at about a 4 percent rate over the
April-September period, bringing its growth from the fourth quarter
of 1994 to 3-1/2 percent.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
projected to fall somewhat over the April-to-September period; the
monetary base is nevertheless expected to expand at about a 7-1/4
percent annual rate, supported by continued strong net shipments of
currency abroad.
Directive Language
","alternative B"
1995-09-26,17,"(17) The broad monetary aggregates are expected to grow over
the remainder of this year somewhat more rapidly than forecasted in
the last bluebook. The additional projected strength primarily owes
to the recent decline in market interest rates, both short- and long-
term, which has further narrowed the opportunity costs of holding
retail money balances.4 Under alternative B, M2 is projected to
grow at a 5-3/4 percent rate over the final three months of the year.
M3 is foreseen as expanding at a 6 percent rate, somewhat faster than
the staff's projection of bank credit expansion, reflecting the an-
ticipated ongoing shift from nondeposit to deposit sources of funding.
In the fourth quarter, the velocities of both monetary aggregates
would continue to decline, albeit at a reduced pace. M2 in the fourth
quarter would be quite near the top of its 1 to 5 percent annual
growth cone, while M3 would be well above its 2 to 6 percent annual
growth range. (A table showing the growth rates of the monetary
aggregates over the balance of the year under each of the alternatives
is attached.)

(9) The Greenbook forecast assumes no significant macro-
economic effects from any temporary disruptions incurred in the
process of determining the longer-run stance of fiscal policy. As
core consumer inflation staying at about 3 percent. Despite the lack
of a downward tilt to the inflation projection, the Committee still
might favor the unchanged stance of policy in alternative B if it
viewed the benefits of further disinflation as insufficient to justify
a more restrictive policy stance that pushed the economy below its
potential. The case for alternative B would be even stronger if the
Committee viewed the staff inflation forecast as too pessimistic--
either because spending would be weaker or because the price-output
relationship would be more favorable than the staff assessment.
Moreover, uncertainties about the economic outlook might seem par-
ticularly large, both because of the fiscal situation and because of
conflicting signals about spending and production. Such circumstances
could reinforce the desire to stand pat, awaiting clarification of the
(10) Earlier expectations of the possibility of easing at the
November FOMC meeting have largely been erased and, thus, the choice
of alternative B should have little impact on market interest rates.
The dollar would trade on foreign exchange markets around its current
level. Although market attention over the intermeeting period is
likely to remain focused on the budget deliberations, evidence of
persistent strength in private final demands along the lines of the
staff forecast might cause markets to begin to question their expecta-
tions about the path of interest rates going forward, and intermedi-
ate- and long-term rates could edge higher.
(11) The choice of easing under alternative A might be
favored if it were thought that some information about spending--for
example, soft industrial commodity prices and a sluggish manufacturing
sector or slowing growth of broad money and credit--was suggesting a
weakening in aggregate demand not yet evident in more general statis-
tics. These indicators might be signalling that real interest rates
already have been on the high side, and these rates could be rising
further, especially at the short end of the maturity spectrum, in
light of the recent decline in inflation and, most likely, inflation
expectations. In effect, the downward slope to the near-term yield
curve and narrow spread of the entire curve could be signalling that
real short-term rates are above those consistent with moderate growth,
especially in the face of impending fiscal restraint.
(12) The cut in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points
under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than now expected
in the market. Consequently, it would show through to other money
market interest rates, and banks would trim 1/2 percentage point off
the prime rate. The dollar would be expected to weaken on foreign
exchange markets as interest rates on dollar-denominated assets fell
in relation to those on other major currencies. The sustainability of
any decline in bond rates would depend on whether market participants
similarly saw the easing to be called for or rather viewed it to be
premature and unsustainable, as might become the case if indicators in
the period just ahead were broadly in line with the staff forecast.
(13) The choice of alternative C might be favored to the
extent that the Committee wished to have greater assurance that infla-
tion would continue to edge down. A more restrictive policy to
accomplish this objective might be seen as all the more needed in
light of recent strength in broad measures of output and labor input.
Furthermore, intermediate- and long-term interest rates have declined
substantially in recent months, potentially providing considerable
further impetus to spending.
(14) A move to tighten policy by 50 basis points as under
alternative C would especially surprise market participants, who con-
tinue to hold the view, supported by statements from some Committee
members, that the next policy move will be to ease. Money market
rates would rise by at least the 50 basis point increase in the fed-
eral funds rate. The dollar would tend to strengthen on foreign
exchange markets, and intermediate- and long-term interest rates would
retrace some of their recent declines as a higher path for real short-
term rates came to be built into market expectations.
(15) The table below presents expected growth of money and
debt under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. In
credit markets, supply conditions are expected to remain generally
favorable. However, the likely cutback in business lending by Japa-
nese banks and possible tendency for consumer lenders to become more
selective suggest that credit may become less freely available for
some borrowers. Nonetheless, borrowing by nonfederal sectors is
expected to firm a little from the subdued pace of recent months. For
businesses, strong cash flow and some slowing in the pace of inventory
accumulation will act to hold down financing needs, although this
effect will be offset by the scheduled completion of some large merg-
ers and associated share retirements in coming months. In the house-
hold sector, debt growth will be sustained in the near term in financ-
ing further healthy advances in durable goods outlays and fairly
robust housing activity. Total nonfederal debt is projected to expand
at below a 5 percent annual rate over late 1995 and early 1996. Fed-
eral borrowing will be light in the months immediately ahead, even
absent a spending lapse or debt-ceiling crisis, before strengthening
late in the winter. Taken together, total nonfinancial sector debt is
projected to grow 5-1/4 percent in 1995, around the middle of its
monitoring range, and to maintain that pace early in 1996.

(16) The broad monetary aggregates, especially M2, are
expected to strengthen after October. Moderate nominal income growth
and fairly narrow opportunity costs will tend to buoy expansion in
household demand for M2, helping to return growth in this aggregate to
the 4-1/2 percent area over the October-to-March period under alterna-
tive B. The rebound in M2 growth, combined with still-brisk issuance
of large time deposits to fund bank credit, would result in about
velocity would continue to decline over the fourth quarter of this
year and the first quarter of next year, albeit at a slower pace. The
velocity of M2, in contrast, should edge up over these two quarters,
reversing part of its unexpectedly large third-quarter decline. Mean-
while, M1 is projected to remain on a downward trajectory, owing to
the further spread of retail sweeps. For the year 1995, the staff
projects M2 to rise 4-1/4 percent, in the upper portion of its 1-to-5
percent range, and M3 to advance 6-1/2 percent, a little above its 2-
to-6 percent range. In March of 1996, both aggregates would be near
the upper ends of their tentative ranges for next year.
Contingencies Regarding a Treasury Default
(17) While a Treasury default on November 15 seems extremely
unlikely, given the financing flexibility apparently available to the
Secretary of the Treasury, the threat of default may linger for some
time. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the financial market conse-
quences of the inability of the U.S. Treasury to meet its obligations.
Payments on principal, interest, and a variety of other obligations
would be delayed for an unknown length of time, creating liquidity
strains for many banks and their customers. Strains could be com-
pounded by frictions in pricing, trading, and financing of matured
securities and overdue interest coupons. If trading conventions were
established to minimize those frictions, and if the Treasury could
clarify that interest would continue to accrue after maturity,
liquidity in the market for these instruments could be maintained to
some extent,.likely mitigating price changes. Nonetheless, with no
experience to guide judgments about these effects, sizable price
movements are conceivable--and, in any case, markets are likely to be
quite skittish. Treasury securities are the benchmark for pricing
many financial instruments and widely used as collateral, and, conse-
quently, the potential exists for spillover effects to other markets.

2004-06-29,17,"(17) In contrast to the language proposed for Alternative B, the
announcement accompanying a 50-basis-point hike could indicate that incoming
inflation data are somewhat elevated, and long-term inflation expectations have shown some tendency
to edge higher, as part of the rationale for the action.  As in the other alternatives, the
Committee presumably would choose under this alternative to state that the risks to
growth were balanced if its outlook for real GDP is roughly in line with the
Greenbook.  In principle, it could also retain an assessment that the risks to price
stability were balanced in view of the restraining effects of the relatively large policy
move.  However, if the Committee were sufficiently worried about inflation to select
such an aggressive policy at this time, it might well see the risks to inflation as now
skewed to the upside.  With regard to the final sentence of the existing risk
assessment, a 50-basis-point move would seem to call for deletion of the measured
language.

2004-08-10,17,"(17) Unless the employment report for July turns out to be exceptionally
strong, market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of a 50-basis-
point move and the announcement proposed under Alternative C.  The assessment of
upside risks to growth and inflation and the deletion of the measured pace  language
would reinforce the sense that the trajectory of policy would be steeper than
previously anticipated.  Market interest rates would likely increase sharply, while stock
prices would drop and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would rise.

The announcement of this policy choice would surprise investors, and real and
nominal interest rates would likely decline, especially at shorter maturities, putting
downward pressure on the dollar.  Stock prices might rise, although the sense that
aggregate demand might be weaker than investors had perceived could lead them to
revise down their outlook for profits, tending to offset the positive effect of lower
interest rates on equity prices.

2005-02-01,17,"(17) If the Committee believes that a more rapid return to a neutral policy stance
is needed to prevent output overshooting its potential and putting upward pressures
on inflation down the road, it may choose one or all of the components included in
the statement under Alternative C.  A 50 basis point increase in the target funds rate
at this meeting might be selected if members believe that a more gradual tightening,
along the lines of the Greenbook assumption or the expectations of market
participants, could promote excessive risk-taking, unsustainable spending, and an
increase in inflation.  Private forecasters continue to anticipate a higher rate of
inflation than the staff, and the Committee may share such a forecast under the policy
paths implied by market prices or assumed in the Greenbook.  Members may place
high odds on aggregate demand being stronger than in the staff forecast because they
believe that the saving rate will stay persistently low or that investment spending will
not slip with the end of the partial expensing tax provisions.  Similarly, a less

optimistic outlook for aggregate supply and the attendant consequences for inflation
might incline the Committee to pick up the pace of policy firming.7
","Alternative C"
2005-03-22,17,"(17) Market participants would be caught off guard by the 50 basis point
tightening of Alternative C.   Moreover, investors could infer from the concerns
expressed about inflation and the removal of the measured-pace language that further
half-point policy tightenings could well be forthcoming.  Interest rates would likely
rise sharply across the yield curve, while stock prices would decline in response to
both the rise in rates and an associated marking down of prospects for earnings
growth.  The rise in longer-term yields would be tempered to the extent that investors
scaled down their longer-term inflation expectations.  The market reaction to the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 37
language of Alternative C would be somewhat attenuated if the Committee boosted
rates at this meeting by only a quarter point.  Even in this case, however, the language
would presumably be read as suggesting that a more rapid removal of policy
accommodation was likely in the futurethat is, 50 basis point moves could well be
in the cards.  The market reaction to adoption of Alternative A is more difficult to
gauge, but the mention of cumulative firming, upbeat assessment of inflation
prospects, and the characterization of the stance of policy as only somewhat
accommodative in the rationale paragraph should tend to put some downward
pressure on yields.  Some observers might interpret the absence of the measured-pace
language as an indication of increased odds of a pause at upcoming meetings.  On net,
interest rates would probably drop and stock prices would likely move up following
the announcement.

2005-05-03,17,"(17) Should the Committee be particularly concerned that underlying inflation
pressures may be intensifying, it might be attracted to the 50-basis-point increase in
the federal funds rate of Alternative C.  Members may be more inclined than the
staff to assign signal, rather than noise, to the jump in the March CPI.  Also, prices
of far-dated crude oil futures contracts have remained elevated over the period since
the last Greenbook, which could be seen as implying little likelihood of a significant
unwinding of the previous run-up in energy costs.  As discussed in an alternative
scenario in the Greenbook, firms might pass on to their customers more of the
higher energy costs than in the baseline forecast.  Moreover, actual productivity
growth appears to have slowed over recent quarters, and Committee members
might be concerned that structural labor productivity will decelerate by more than
incorporated in the staff projection.  Taken together, higher energy prices and
slower underlying productivity growth may be viewed as an especially adverse supply
shock that lowers output in a manner that should be accepted rather than resisted.
Abstracting from such gloom about aggregate supply, last summers episode, as well
as broader economic experience, suggests that soft patches crop up from time to
time and do not necessarily threaten robust expansion of aggregate demand over a
longer period.  If the Committee believes that economic growth is likely to remain
solid, it could move to check elevated inflation pressures by more vigorous policy
action at this meeting.  The words of Alternative C (from row 2 down) might have
an appeal even if the Committee chose to firm 25 basis points at this meeting.  A
C-lite approach would convey a sense that the Committee wished to ensure that
the market understood that future policy options spanned a wider range than the
current statement might appear to some to allow.  As long as references to the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 40
accommodative stance of policy remain elsewhere in the statement, market
participants would interpret that flexibility as introducing a tilt toward a firmer,
rather than an easier, funds rate.  Removing all forward-looking guidance would
require excising characterizations of the degree of accommodation as well as the
measured pace language.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2005-06-29,17,"(17) The draft statement associated with Alternative A could be explicit that
The Committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has
been substantially reduced.  Presuming that the FOMC would again wish to indicate
that robust underlying productivity growth was supporting the economic expansion,
the announcement could follow that indication with Nonetheless, growth in
spending slowed somewhat in the spring while again acknowledging that labor
market conditions apparently continue to improve gradually.  With regard to prices,
the statement could accentuate the positive by indicating that Readings on inflation
have been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have
declined.  Finally, the FOMC could indicate that remaining policy accommodation
can likely be removed at a measured pace.
","Alternative A"
2005-08-09,17,"(17) The Committee could consider a number of modifications to its statement
in conjunction with the selection of Alternative C.  For instance, the FOMC might
wish to delete the reference to robust underlying growth in productivity.  Although
the staff continues to forecast solid growth of structural productivity, the Committees
confidence on this score may be diminishing and hence it might not wish to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 35
characterize the pace of underlying productivity growth so explicitly.  The statement
could highlight the strength of the economy by stating that Aggregate spending
appears to be expanding briskly despite high energy prices.  It could acknowledge
recent price developments while registering some concern about inflation prospects
by noting that Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-
term inflation expectations seem well contained, but pressures on business costs and
inflation appear to be increasing.  As discussed in the June Bluebook, the Committee
might also take this opportunity to eliminate the forward-looking language from the
statement, dropping both the risk assessment and the last two sentences referring to
the measured pace of tightening and to the Committees commitment to respond to
economic developments as needed to maintain price stability.
","Alternative C"
2005-12-13,17,"(17) Release of the statement for Alternative C would lead market participants to
boost noticeably their expectations for policy tightening.  As noted previously,
investors appear to have put some odds on the Committee dropping or modifying the
accommodation and measured pace phrases at this meeting as a prelude to
winding up this tightening phase.  Moreover, the concerns expressed about the
relatively high levels of resource utilization would come as a surprise to investors.
Regarding near-term expectations, the retention of the measured pace language
could lead investors not only to conclude that a quarter-point move in January was
virtually certain but also to mark up appreciably the odds on a policy tightening in
March.  And, beyond that point, the anticipated path for policy would probably

steepen as well.  Reflecting the change in policy expectations, short- and intermediate-
term interest rates would rise, stock prices decline, and the dollar appreciate.

","Alternative C"
2006-01-31,17,"(17) If the Committee believes that appreciable further policy firming will likely
be needed to address upside risks to inflationwhich include the potential pass-
through of higher prices of oil and other commodities and a lower foreign exchange
value of the dollarit may prefer to associate a ¼ percentage point increase in the
target funds rate at this meeting with the language in Alternative C.  A firmer tone
might also seem appropriate in light of the longer-run scenarios discussed earlier.  To
achieve a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, model-based optimal policy
paths, along with several policy rules shown in Charts 8 and 9, point to a need to raise
the funds rate above 4½ percent fairly soon.8  Even if a target funds rate above
term pressures on inflation.  In addition, the moderation in spending growth in the
staff forecast depends in part on some cooling of house price appreciation, which is
not yet a foregone conclusion, and projecting a more restrictive stance of policy may
be appropriate until such a trend is better established.

uncertainty about the policy path obtained from model-based simulations of future 
economic shocks and on options quotes, as discussed in the box.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 42
New Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules 
 
This Bluebook introduces two new exhibits related to policy rules.  First, Chart 8 depicts the 
implications of estimated policy rules, together with information from futures and options 
prices.  In the top left panel, the dashed line denotes the path implied by a rule that relates 
the federal funds rate to its own lagged values, to the current four-quarter average core PCE 
inflation rate, and to the current and lagged output gap (known as an outcome-based rule 
because it relies on observed macroeconomic variables).  This empirical specification was 
chosen using a formal statistical procedure that balances simplicity of the specification with 
goodness-of-fit over the sample period 1988Q1 through 2005Q4.  Dynamic simulation of 
the FRB/US model was then used to determine the predicted funds rate path that this rule 
implies over the Greenbook horizon.1  
 
The chart also depicts the range of uncertainty for the outcome-based rule associated with 
the incidence of shocks that might occur over the forecast period.  For that purpose, 
stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model were performed using the estimated 
distribution of shocks over the post-1987 period to every equation of the model, except the 
policy rule.  The dark green region shows the 70 percent confidence interval while the light 
green region denotes the 90 percent confidence interval. 
 
The dotted line in the left panel portrays the path prescribed by a forecast-based rule, 
estimated using Greenbook forecasts for the two-quarter-ahead four-quarter-average core 
PCE inflation rate and the one-quarter-ahead and one-quarter lag of the output gap, along 
with two lags of the funds rate.  This specification was chosen by a procedure similar to that 
for the outcome-based rule.  Relative to the outcome-based rule, this rule prescribes a path 
that is tighter by about ¼ percentage point during 2006 and easier by a similar amount 
during 2007.2   
 
The right panel of Chart 8 provides information from futures and options markets.  
Expectations for the federal funds rate derived from quotes on federal funds and Eurodollar 
futures are shown as a dotted line in the right panel.  The expected funds rate has a mild 
humped shape over the next two years.  The confidence bands reflect uncertainty as 
computed from options prices.  Note that financial markets have built in somewhat less 
uncertainty than is suggested by the stochastic simulations of the outcome-based rule. 
 
Finally, Chart 9 reports on prescriptions from simple policy rules that have been included in  
Bluebooks since January 2004.  Using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, these rule 
prescriptions are now shown for the entire Greenbook horizon.  With an inflation objective 
of 1½ percent, the baseline and aggressive Taylor rules prescribe funds rate paths that are 
lower than the Greenbook assumption, whereas the first-difference rule implies a markedly 
tighter path during 2007.

For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staffs estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (t), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead (t+2|t and t+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
( t ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap (*ty y *1| 1|t t t ty y+ + ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +   ), and the assumed value 
f policymakers long-run inflation objective (o * ).
For periods prior to the current quarter, rule prescriptions are computed using the staffs current 
estimates of the output gap and inflation rate.  Prospective prescriptions are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule will be followed henceforth, starting 
at this FOMC meeting.  To reflect the relative timing of this meeting within the current quarter, this 
quarters prescription is a weighted average of the value computed from current staff projections of the 
output gap and inflation rate and the value obtained from the FRB/US model simulations described 
above.  Finally, for the forecast-based rule and the first-difference rule, it should be noted that 
prescriptions near the end of the Greenbook horizon also depend on the extended Greenbook baseline.

Time-varying Sensitivity of Interest Rates to Macroeconomic News
The response of U.S. Treasury yields to new information is unlikely to be constant 
over time.  One statistical approach to capture variation is to augment a regression of two-
year yields on economic-data surprises with a common time-varying coefficient.  This yields 
a sensitivity index, for which a value of one is neutral and values above one indicate that the 
market is more sensitive than average to the news contained in economic-data releases.  The 
sensitivity index, plotted in the figure below, has moved in a wide range over the last fifteen 
years.
The estimated sensitivity was higher on average during the first half of the 1990s than 
in subsequent years, although one marked exception was the year prior to the start of the 
current tightening cycle.  Sensitivity peaked at nearly twice its average level in the spring of 
2005 when market participants awaited the shift in the economic outlook that would trigger 
the onset of policy tightening.  The sensitivity then unwound abruptly when the measured-
pace language was introduced and policy tightening began and is now at an historically low 
level.  All this has occurred despite the message in recent FOMC minutes indicating that 
the future path for the funds rate would depend increasingly on economic developments.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 37
changes the last sentence of the risk assessments paragraph to state that future policy
action will be determined by the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by
incoming information, which might help to remind investors that the future path for
policy is uncertain and will depend on macroeconomic data.  Indeed, members may
be sufficiently concerned about the apparent tendency of financial market participants
to await guidance from policy makers rather than respond to the likely policy
implications of news on the economy to desire such an emphasis under any of the
policy alternatives.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative A"
2006-05-10,17,"(17) The rationale portion of the policy statement associated with Alternative C
could temper the expectation of a moderation in growth with the observation that
data confirming a slowing in growth have been sparse.  As in March, the inflation
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 41
paragraph could cite limited energy-price pass-through and productivity gains as
having helped to hold inflation in check, but would not indicate that the Committee
expected core inflation to remain contained.  Reasserting that inflation expectations
are contained might be problematic, and, as in Alternative B, rising inflation
expectations could be cited as a factor that could add to inflation pressures.  In light
of the size of the policy move, the Committee might want to declare that the risks to
its dual objectives are balanced.
","Alternative C, Alternative B"
2006-06-28,17,"(17) The Committee might instead desire a more forceful policy response to the
deterioration in the inflation outlook and find some appeal in the 50 basis point
tightening of Alternative C.  Although measures of inflation expectations have edged
lower on balance in recent weeks, they have risen since earlier this year, potentially
adding momentum to actual inflation.  Moreover, resource utilization appears to be
relatively high, and some policymakers have noted that inflation is already above a
range they see as consistent with price stability.  In these circumstances, the
Committee might be concerned by the risk that the recently higher readings on
inflation could get embedded in inflation expectations along the lines of the rising
inflation expectations alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  The Committee may
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 41
also favor a more sizable move now so as to make more rapid progress toward
moving inflation lower.  In the alternative policy simulation presented earlier, the
pursuit of a 1½ percent inflation target requires additional tightening in the near term,
especially so if inflation deviations receive a higher relative weight in the FOMCs
objective function.  If policymakers believed that additional firming, beyond a 50 basis
point policy move at this meeting, probably would be necessary, they may find it
appropriate to indicate a fairly high likelihood that further tightening was in train.
Such an indication may be particularly appealing if firmer financial conditions were
judged to be desirable to make satisfactory progress toward the Committees
","Alternative C"
2006-08-08,17,"(17) As in Alternative B, shorter-term interest rates would fall a little in response
to an announcement along the lines of Alternative A.  However, longer-term yields
might edge higher if market participants became concerned that the Committee was
underestimating inflation risks or was willing to tolerate somewhat higher rates of
inflation going forward than earlier anticipated.
","Alternative B, Alternative A"
2006-10-24,17,"(17) If the Committee judges that the news since its decision to hold the funds
target unchanged in September has not significantly altered the outlook for inflation
and activity, it might be attracted to Alternative B.  A combination of below-trend
growth and an edging lower in core inflation, as in the staff forecast, may be viewed as
the best attainable outcome.  With the real federal funds rate around the upper end of
the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium value as noted earlier, the
Committee might judge the current stance of policy as broadly consistent with
achieving this result.  Moreover, from a risk-management perspective, modest policy
restraint may be viewed as appropriately weighing the competing risks to inflation and
economic growth.  The possibility that inflation expectations could begin to drift
higher and the tightness of the labor market, as evidenced by data on labor
compensation and reports of difficulties in filing certain positions, may both be
viewed as pointing to upside risks to costs and prices in the Greenbook projection.
Despite those upside inflation risks, the Committee may want to refrain from
tightening in light of the downside risks to economic growth, including the possibility

expectations, and the cumulative effects

2006-12-12,17,"(17) In contrast, the Committee may now see it as unlikely that inflation will
decline at an acceptable pace should the current stance of policy be maintained and
hence judge it necessary to take further policy action, as in the 25 basis point firming
of Alternative C.  In particular, members may believe that the tightness in labor
markets means that inflation may fail to decline, and could even rise, as illustrated in
the Greater wage acceleration scenario presented in the Greenbook.  In addition,

the recent easing of financial conditions could impart significant stimulus to aggregate
demand, augmenting pressure on resources.  Also, some members may judge that
long-term inflation expectations are higher than would be consistent with an
appreciable decline in inflation from recent rates and that monetary policy needs to
tighten to help foster a reduction in these expectations.  Even if members think that
the staffs forecast for core inflation to edge gradually lower is reasonable, they may
consider the extent and pace of that expected decline, in which core PCE inflation is
projected to remain above 2 percent through 2008, to be unacceptable, and hence see
further policy firming as necessary.  In the medium-term strategies presented earlier,
the optimal policy path associated with an inflation objective of 1½ percent involves
raising the federal funds rate to about 6 percent over the next year.

dominant risk.  Consequently, implementation of Alternative B is unlikely to elicit
significant market reaction.

Greenbook-consistent estimate of its equilibrium value (Chart 5), suggesting that the
current stance of policy likely would be consistent with closing the small estimated
output gap over the next several years.  Moreover, the current target for the funds rate
is very close to prescriptions for near-term policy from the optimal policy path

Assessment of 
Risk
The Committee judges that the risks to 
growth are tilted to the downside, even 
after this policy action.  However, 
upside risks to inflation remain. Future 
policy adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.
In these circumstances, the Committees 
principal policy concern remains the 
risk that inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.
In these circumstances, the 
Committees predominant policy 
concern remains the risk that inflation 
will fail to moderate as expected.  The 
extent and timing of any additional 
firming that may be needed to address 
this risk will depend on the evolution 
of the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.

simulations of the FRB/US model for a 2 percent inflation goal (Chart 6).  If the
Committee sees the combination of gradual convergence to potential output and a
given current conditions, it might favor no change in policy, as in Alternative B.  In
that regard, the central tendency of the forecasts submitted by the Governors and
Reserve Bank presidents around the time of the January FOMC meeting suggested
that the Committee was more optimistic than the staff about potential output,
perhaps implying that keeping the funds rate constant is likely to generate both brisker
growth and a larger decline in core inflation than the staff projects.  Although
members may think that dislocations in the subprime mortgage market will reduce
funding for home purchases in that sector, tending to deepen the slide in housing
construction, they may also be of the view that the drop in market yields in recent
weeks will mean lower mortgage rates for prime borrowers going forward, perhaps
spurring an earlier recovery in construction and sales of new homes.  Given these
potentially offsetting forces, the Committee may be inclined to wait for more
information on consumer spending and housing demand before adjusting the stance
of policy.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative B"
2007-05-09,17,"(17) The rationale for Alternative A would note that, although the economy
seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace, the weakness in housing and capital
spending implies a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than
anticipated.  Given the moderation in inflation in March, the Committee might wish
to switch the ordering of the clauses in the second sentence of the inflation paragraph
to suggest a slightly more benign outlook for inflation.  Even so, with opposing risks
to activity and inflation, the statement would indicate that the Committee has no clear
predilection concerning the likely future direction of policy and that policy
adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.
","Alternative A"
2007-06-27,17,"(17) If the Committee continues to view the current policy stance as likely to
foster a return of output to potential and sustain the recent moderation of inflation, as
in the staff forecast, then it may wish to choose Alternative B, under which the
federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent.  In the staff analysis underlying the
Greenbook forecast, the real federal funds rate is seen as near its equilibrium value
(Chart 6), suggesting that the current stance of policy is likely to reduce pressures on
resources over time.  Additionally, the current target for the funds rate is very close to
prescriptions for near-term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a
While financial conditions tightened substantially over the intermeeting period,
Committee members may view this development as merely bringing forward an
adjustment they had anticipated would occur before long, suggesting that no policy
offset is necessary.  The Committee might also judge that maintaining its current
policy stance for the time being would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks that
weakness in housing could eventually have a more pronounced effect on overall
economic activity and that the recent moderation in inflation could prove temporary.

2007-08-07,17,"(17) This Bluebook presents three options, summarized in Table 1, for the
Committees consideration.  Alternative A would lower the target federal funds rate

across the three options:  Alternatives A and B refer explicitly or implicitly to recent

Overall economic activity seems likely 
to continue to expand at a moderate 
pace over coming quarters.  However, 
increased weakness in the housing 
sector, along with reduced availability 
and higher cost of credit to some 
households and businesses, has raised 
the risk that economic activity might 
grow less than anticipated.
Economic growth was moderate 
during the first half of this year.  The

rebound.  All three alternatives reiterate the view that the economy is likely to expand
at a moderate rate in coming quarters.  With regard to recent financial developments,
Alternative A cites tighter credit conditions for some borrowers as a source of greater
downside risk to growth, Alternative B notes the change in credit conditions without
explicitly stating that it is a cause of increased risk, and Alternative C is silent.  Data
received during the intermeeting period confirmed that core inflation has been fairly
low in recent months but also indicate that core inflation has not extended the decline
that occurred earlier.  Accordingly, all the alternatives refer to relatively subdued
readings on core inflation in recent months rather than repeating the June language
that core inflation improved modestly in recent months.  The alternatives differ in
their assessment of the severity of the upside risks to the outlook for inflation.  As
always, the Committee could combine elements from different alternatives.

2007-12-11,17,"(17)  If the Committee judges that tighter financial conditions, higher oil prices,
and soft incoming data point to a weaker economic outlook than previously
anticipated, then it may deem a more accommodative stance of policy to be
appropriate and ease policy 25 basis points, as in Alternative B.  The real federal
funds rate is nearly half a percentage point above its downwardly revised Greenbook-
consistent equilibrium value and a touch above the upper end of the range of model-
based estimates (Chart 5), suggesting that a reduction in the target funds rate may be
required to keep output near its potential.  Several policy rules (Chart 7) also suggest
that further policy easing would be appropriate.  Moreover, members might be
concerned about the risk of possible further deterioration in financial conditions,
particularly in the run-up to year-end, or about the potential for significant spillovers
from the housing sector to the broader economy.  If so, they may judge that a policy
easing at this meeting might help insure against such developments.  At the same
time, the Committee may believe that the risks to inflation associated with a 25 basis
point reduction in the target federal funds rate are modest, given recent readings on
core inflation and the current outlook for prices.

Alternative B.  The staff forecasts assumes that the funds rate is cut to 3 percent
at this meeting and then maintained at that rate through 2009; with that stance of
policy, the unemployment rate remains about ½ percentage point above the staffs
estimate of the NAIRU while core inflation edges just below 2 percent at the end of
next year.  Members might consider this combination of outcomes to be about the
best feasible under current circumstances, reflecting the extent to which recent data
have pointed towards a noticeable worsening of the short-run tradeoff between
economic activity and inflation.  Even if Committee members are somewhat more
optimistic than the staff regarding the modal outlook for economic activity, they may
view this policy action as appropriate for mitigating the downside risks to growth
that were emphasized in the January 22 FOMC statement.  Indeed, since investors
uncertainty about the economic outlook is apparently contributing to elevated credit
spreads and dampened consumer and business spending, a substantial easing move
at this meeting could bolster confidence that policymakers will act as needed to foster
sustained growth and reduce the likelihood of adverse macroeconomic developments
such as the Greenbooks Recession scenario.  However, policymakers may prefer
at this stage not to take out further insurance by easing more than 50 basis points,
given the possibility that such a move could induce an upward shift in the distribution
of inflation outcomes over coming quarters, as illustrated by the Gradual Reversal
scenario in the box on Risk Management Strategies.  Nonetheless, by explicitly
noting that downside risks remain, the Committee would suggest the possibility that
substantial further easing could be needed in response to incoming information.

firmer than those currently prevailing as described in paragraph (12) above.
These firmer conditions might include a Federal funds rate generally in a

1970-09-15,18,"(18) The adjusted credit proxy is expected to grow some-
what more rapidly, along with the more rapid growth in money supply,
as compared with alternative A. Money supply growth is not expected to
become more rapid until October, although the exact lags over the near-
term in public and bank responses to monetary policy changes are con-
jectural. Net inflows of time deposits to banks are likely to become
larger as market interest rates decline--making CD's viable throughout
the maturity range. However, since business loan demands are expected
to be moderate, we would expect banks to drop their CD offering rates
in line with declines in other market interest rates. As CD's become
a more certain source of funds, banks may become more willing to let
commercial paper run off and to reduce Euro-dollar borrowings. Thus,
the upward effect on the adjusted bank credit proxy of the rather
marked lowering of market interest rates expected under this alterna-
tive might not be extremely sharp, and will likely depend in part on the
extent to which businesses switch from open market to bank borrowing
and on the extent to which banks and dealers take speculative positions
in securities.

proposed for possible use if the Committee decides that the shortfall
in January from the path associated with its earlier first-quarter
target growth rate (which in itself allowed for a make-up of the short-
fall that occurred in the fourth quarter) is to be made up in the re-
maining part of the first quarter.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

increase, given transactions needs associated with staff GNP projections,
an opportunity cost of holding money lower on average in the second quarter
than in the first, and the probablity that expectations of rising interest
rates (and falling capital values) would become more pervasive in an expanding
economic situation. Growth in M2 would be expected to moderate from the first
quarter pace, even under alternative A, however, as the initial asset ad-
justment by the public to the sharp drop of late 1970 and early 1971 in market
rates relative to time deposit offering rates runs it course.
(12) The demand for bank credit is expected to be fairly strong
over the coming months under any of the alternatives. Growth in outstanding
business loans at banks may not be as rapid as in February, but it is likely to
be fairly sizable, sustained as the second quarter progresses by some switching
of borrowers from relatively high cost capital market financing to relatively
low cost bank loans. In consequence, banks may not be as active in the market
for State and local government securities as they had been in the latter part
of 1970 and early 1971. They are likely to continue seeking CD funds on a
modest scale under prevailing market conditions and to reduce Euro-dollar
borrowings at about the recent pace. If money market conditions tighten--as
may be required under alternatives B and C--expectations of rising short-
term interest rates will give banks an added incentive to issue CD's in the
near-term, especially longer-term CD's, offsetting in part expected slower growth
under these conditions in demand and other time deposits.
(13) An effort to move onto growth paths for aggregates in the
second quarter slower than shown for alternative A--given staff assumptions
as to the strength of economic recovery and attendent credit demands--seems
likely to require a rise in the Federal funds rate from current levels during
the next four weeks. The money market conditions now estimated to be con-
sistent with alternative A through C are shown in the table below, using the
second quarter annual rate of growth in M1 as a convenient index of the col-
lection of monetary aggregates. Difference in money market conditions of these
dimensions would be expected to have only relatively minor effects on growth
rates for the aggregates in March.

Alternative A 3-1/2 250-350 + 50 to -150 9%
Alternative B 3-3/4--4-1/4 400-500 -150 to -300 7%
Alternative C 4-1/4--4-3/4 500-600 -250 to -400 6%
(14) Weekly paths for key monetary aggregates are shown in the
table on the next page.
(15) Treasury financing plans will be an influence on interest rates
over the next few weeks. A total of around $5 billion of new securities could
be announced between now and the next meeting of the Committee, but the exact
timing of announcements is quite uncertain. depending in part on the progress
of debt ceiling legislation. The cash is likely to be raised through bills
and also possibly a short note, with the latter announced, if at all, in late
March or early April.
(16) This additional supply in the short-term area may be no
more than a modest offset to downward pressure on short rates from maturing

tax bills, from continued foreign demand for bills, from reinvestment of the
proceeds of the extremely large volume of long-term corporate bond offerings,
and from paydowns of Federal agency debt. Thus, it is possible that bill
rates will decline somewhat further, though maintenance of a Federal funds
rate around 3-1/2 per cent would dampen further rate declines. If the Federal
funds rate is moved up, bill rates are likely to rise. How rapidly the bill
rate moves up would depend for the most part on the attitudes of market
participants--how soon they come to believe a rise in the funds rate would
stick and whether they come to think that it would presage a further rise.
Under alternative B money market specifications, a 3-month bill rate in a
(17) If short-term rates do not rise over the next few weeks, the
staff would expect long-term market yields to work down, given the present
wide spread of long over short rates, once headway is made in absorbing the
exceptionally large volume of corporate bonds in the immediate offing. In the
corporate and municipal bond market the recent rise in yields has probably
reflected some discounting of potential future rate increases. Thus, a rise in
short-rates of about the magnitude indicated for alternative B might not be
accompanied by any appreciable rise in long rates over the second quarter as a
whole, although an initial market reaction would be likely; money market
tightening of the degree contemplated under alternative C might well bring a
more lasting long-term rate advance.
(18) It is recognized that the Committee could regard the second
quarter projections of the aggregatesasproblematical at this juncture and could
be more concerned over the policy implications of the recent firming that has
taken place in bond markets. If in these circumstances the Committee would
wish to promote somewhat easier over-all credit conditions, including near-
term declines in long-term rates, it could consider a policy alternative--
such as Alternative D--that would call for some further easing of money
market conditions. A Federal funds rate consistently around 3--3-1/4 per
cent would encourage lower dealer loan rates and would lead to a further drop
in short-term market rates and perhaps the prime rate. The 3-month bill rate
might fluctuate around 3 per cent. Such developments would tend in time to
bring long-term rates down, as a widened spread of long- over short-term rates
provided greater encouragement to private borrowers to take advantage of the
lower short-term financing rates. Indications of a continuing easing trend
in monetary policy would also make dealers more willing holders of, and under-
writers more aggressive bidders for, long-term debt.

1971-05-11,18,"(18) The 3- onth bill rate would be likely to rise under
alternative B, perhaps to around 4-1/2 per cent, or somewhat higher if
expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate should develop.
Should expectations of a discount rate move become pervasive, it may also
tend to keep bond yields under upward pressure. Apart from the effects of
such expectations, the recent run-up in bond yields has anticipated a good
part of the firming in day-to-day money rates of the magnitude contemplated
in this alternative.
","alternative B"
1971-06-08,18,"(18) Alternative C. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides to adopt as targets the growth rates dis-
cussed earlier in connection with alternative C, and to instruct the Desk
to move to the money market conditions noted in paragraph (9) in connec-
tion with that alternative.
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to
moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregate over

This language has been formulated in a manner which the staff believes
would underscore the Committee's determination to slow the growth rates
in the aggregates.

1971-08-24,18,"(18) If the Committee adopts alternative C it may want to instruct
the Manager to make his operating decisions on the basis of available
evidence regarding the relationship between the actual supply of reserves
and the supply considered to be best calculated to promote growth in the
monetary and credit aggregates at the desired rates. In addition, the
Manager might be given leeway to adjust the target paths for total and non-
borrowed reserves to take account of deviations in U.S. Government deposits
and in deposit^ distribution between reserve city and country banks from original pro-
jections. The Manager might also be advised that in making day-to-day
operating decisions he should refer particularly to information on non-
borrowed reserves, but should also take into account data on member bank
borrowings for what they indicate about both the behavior of total reserves
and the degree of tension in the banking system. Similarly, he might be
instructed to use information on the cost of reserves--as reflected primarily
in the Federal funds rate--as a supplementary and early indicator of the
effective supply of reserves in the market.

monetary aggregates. It could involve the same initial specification as
A, but the reaction to specification misses would be different. For
instance, if the Committee adopts this alternative, it presumably will want
the Desk to be more sensitive to movements away from the paths in the
aggregates and to adjust the Federal funds rate promptly, and perhaps
more aggressively, in response to such deviations. As in alternative A,
the Committee may wish to indicate a greater willingness to countenance
overshoots in the aggregates than shortfalls.
","Alternative B, alternative B, alternative A"
1971-12-14,18,"(18) Alternative A. If the Committee wishes to formulate the
directive in terms of money market conditions subject to a proviso clause,
for purposes of the proviso clause it could employ the growth rates of
either alternative A or B--e.g., 6 or 7 per cent, respectively, for M1
in the first quarter. If the Committee favors the alternative A growth
rates, it might adopt the following language.
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote
somewhat greater growth in monetary and credit aggregates over
the months ahead.] System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to

MEETING; [DEL: consistent with that objective] PROVIDED THAT OPERATIONS
SHALL BE MODIFIED IF IT APPEARS THAT THE MONETARY AND CREDIT
AGGREGATES ARE DEVIATING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE GROWTH PATHS
The primary instruction calls for maintaining ""about the money market con-
ditions that have prevailed on average since the preceding meeting"" because
the mid-points of the ranges for money market conditions noted in paragraph
(11) for the alternative A growth rates are closer to the average level of
money market conditions since the November 16 meeting than they are to
easier conditions recently prevailing. If the Committee would prefer to
have the aggregates grow along the alternative B paths, it might modify
the above language to call for ""maintaining money market conditions consis-
tent with the recent reduction in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates"".

natives are in the descriptions of desired growth in monetary aggre-
gates. In alternative A the words ""at somewhat faster rates than in
recent months"" are designed to place an accent on the objective under
this alternative of achieving some pick-up from the average rates of
May and June. In B the term ""moderate"" is suggested in place of the
previous ""somewhat slower"" to avoid any implication that the Committee
seeks a continued slowing of monetary growth from the rates recently
achieved. As indicated, it is proposed to retain the phrase ""somewhat
slower"" in alternative C.

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
Alternative A

in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE
EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support moderate
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.""
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1973-01-16,18,"(18) Alternative A indicates more expansive paths for the
reserve and monetary aggregates which are not likely to entail any
significant change in money market conditions from those recently pre-
vailing; this alternative, therefore, has the greatest probability of
minimizing conflicts between even-keel considerations and monetary
objectives. The funds rate under such conditions is likely to be most
frequently in the 5-3/8--5-7/8 per cent area. If the funds rate were to
remain near the upper end of that band, the 3-month bill rate probably
would be within a 5-1/4--5-1/2 per cent range over the next several weeks.
Upward bill rate pressures could be moderated in the near-term, however,
by demands for bills from State and local governments who have just
received their January revenue-sharing distribution. In addition, apart
from additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions, the next sizable
bill offering is not expected until early March, as noted earlier.
","Alternative A"
1973-05-15,18,"(18) The 6 month comparison works quite well for M1, since
the long-term target range specified under alternative B (5--5-1/2 per
cent) and the short-run range of tolerance encompass the 5-1/4 per cent
growth rate experience in the past 6 months; the ranges specified under
A and C are, respectively, somewhat above and somewhat below the 6-month
pace. For the bank credit proxy, actual growth over the past 6 months
exceeds both the long-run target and near-term expectations under all
three alternatives. For RPD and M2 , the situation is a little more compli-
cated, but for the most part the previous 6-month rates of expansion are
above specifications in the three alternatives (with some exceptions in
alternative A).
","alternative B, alternative A"
1973-08-21,18,"(18) Other key assumptions in the monetary relationships pre-
sented are: (a) continued strength in business loan demand on banks;
(b) some reduction in demand for consumer and mortgage credit; (c) con-
tinued active demand by banks for large CD funds, though perhaps less
aggressive demand than in the past four months taken as a whole;
(d) greater bank reluctance to participate in the securities market, par-
ticularly under alternative C, in view of the wide spread of their bor-
rowing costs over their return on portfolio. On balance, bank credit--as
measured by the proxy--is expected to rise by around a 15--16 per cent
annual rate in the August-September period, buoyed in part by a projected
rise in U.S. Treasury deposits at commercial banks. Growth is likely to be
considerably less rapid in the fourth quarter as credit demands fade some-
what, inflows of consumer-type time deposits abate, and Treasury deposits
at banks decline.
","alternative C"
1974-04-15,18,"(18) In intermediate- and long-term debt markets, demands
are likely to remain strong over the weeks ahead. Corporate and State
and local government bond offerings remain quite high, despite recent
postponements. Also, the Treasury refunding will probably involve
marketing securities with mainly intermediate-term maturities. Given
the volume of private and governmental securities in prospect, bond yields
could rise considerably further under alternative C. High-grade corporate
issues, which are already above their summer highs, could approach their
Treasury bond is already above the earlier peak). Under alternative B,
further upward adjustments in bond yields are likely to be comparatively
modest, given the increases that already have occurred and the stabilizing
tendencies that we would expect in short-term markets.
","alternative C, alternative B"
1974-05-21,18,"(18) Restraining M1 growth to a 5½ per cent annual rate over
the second and third quarters--as under alternative B-- would be
expected to put somewhat more pressure on the money market, with the
Federal funds rate rising to around 12 per cent between now and the
next Committee meeting. The 3-month bill rate would likely move up into
an 8½--9½ per cent range over the next few weeks, and other market rates
would also adjust upward. This rise in rates would be needed to hold
the rise in money demands to a pace consistent with a 5½ per cent growth
rate for M1 in the second and third quarters, in view of the larger
increase in prices and nominal GNP. now projected. This relationship
between money growth and interest rates makes no allowance for the
possibility that liquidity preference may increase if confidence in
financial markets continues to weaken.
","alternative B"
1975-02-19,18,"(18) Presented below are four alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. In all four alternatives, it is proposed to
delete the reference to Treasury financing--because the quarterly financing
announced on January 22 has been completed--and the Board's action on
reserve requirements.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1977-04-19,18,"(18) The immediate tightening of the money market contemplated
under alternative C would also more quickly set in train the market and
institutional responses described in paragraph (14). Inflows of time
and savings deposits would begin to slow in the weeks ahead as the bill
rate moved close to and perhaps above the passbook ceiling rate. Large
commercial banks could be expected to become more aggressive in the market
for CD's and nondeposit sources of funds. And thrift institutions would
begin re-evaluating their mortgage market participation.
","alternative C"
1977-07-19,18,"(18) Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market
conditions between now and the next Committee meeting. Interest rates
may tend to decline rather substantially as the funds rate begins to drop,
particularly in the intermediate-term Treasury area where dealers have a
net short position. But assuming that incoming economic news does not
cast doubt on the fundamental strength of the economy, interest rate declines
may be limited over the next month or so as corporations and State and local
governments increase market borrowing in anticipation of higher interest
rates later on and as the market focuses on the Treasury's large fall cash
","Alternative A"
1977-10-17,18,"(18) The easing in money market conditions over the next few
weeks under alternative A would be consistent with a shift to somewhat
higher longer-run growth ranges than those of alternative B. A decline
in the funds rate would have to be soon reversed, though, given the
staff's GNP projections. We would expect the funds rate to rise to
around 7-1/4 per cent by the second quarter of 1978 under this alternative.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative B"
1977-12-19,18,"(18) An easing in the Federal funds rate to 6 per cent, as
envisioned under alternative A, could stimulate a substantial downward
adjustment in short-term market rates. However, the lower level of
rates could not be maintained for long if growth in the aggregates
is to be held within the Committee's longer-run ranges. Thus,
interest rates would soon need to begin rising, and would reach levels
next year higher than those necessary under alternatives B and C.
Under alternative A, M-1 is likely to expand at a 6¼ per cent average
rate of growth over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of
in the second and third quarters of 1978 to about a 4 per cent annual
rate. The projected Federal funds rate pattern to achieve such a
slowdown calls for an increase to around 8¼ per cent in the third
quarter of 1978. Such rate levels would likely warrant consideration
of adjustments to Regulation Q ceilings by next summer.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative A"
1978-01-17,18,"(18) An easing in money market conditions over the next few
weeks under alternative A, which calls for a Federal funds rate of
about 6-1/4 per cent, would come as a considerable surprise so soon
after the Board's recent discount rate action. Recent interest rate
increases would be reversed, although perhaps not entirely in long-term
markets if the rate decline was considered to be temporary. The decline
in short-term rates, however, would tend to soften the dollar in inter-
national exchange markets.
","alternative A"
1978-02-28,18,"(19) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated
under alternative C would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub-
ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would
increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates. Lending
policies of banks and thrift institutions would become more restrictive.
There would be increased pressure on Government support programs in the
mortgage area. The Home Loan Bank System would be expected to turn more
and more to the market to raise cash to support advances to savings and
loan associations, and mortgage bankers would increase takedowns of
existing FNMA commitments while also aggressively seeking new commit-
ments. In such an environment, the increase in short-term rates would
probably be rather promptly transmitted to the intermediate- and long-
term sectors of the market, where Government security dealers still have
a long position of moderate size in Treasury coupon issues.
","alternative C"
1978-04-18,18,"(18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would
rise over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7½ per
cent range. M-1 growth would likely be in a 5½ to 9½ per cent annual
rate range over April and May and M-2 growth in a 6 to 10 per cent
range. Under these circumstances, private short-term rates would
probably rise about percentage point, while Treasury bill rates
may increase somewhat less because of sizable bill paydowns. The
prime rate would also be likely to increase, particularly since
loan demands are expected to remain strong, and bond yields should
continue to move up somewhat. With the rise in market rates, member
bank borrowing from Federal Reserve Banks would expand sharply from
recently reduced levels, increasing pressures for a discount rate
advance. The rise in short-term rates under alternative C may provide
some support for the dollar in international exchange markets.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1978-12-19,18,"(18) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would
rise by mid-January to the midpoint of a 9¾ to 10½ per cent range.
M-1 growth would likely be in a 2 to 7 per cent annual rate range over
December-January, and M-1+ and M-2, respectively, in a ½ to 4½ and
rates of interest would further slow the growth of deposits subject
to fixed rate ceilings, induce more aggressive offerings of MMC's
and large denomination time deposits, and a tightening of bank lending
terms--with the prime loan rate moving up to 11¾ or 12 per cent.
Long-term yields would also probably move up, but the light financing
calendar and further evidence of the System's determination to con-
strain monetary growth would tend to limit such movement.
","alternative B"
1979-02-06,18,"(18) Under alternative II, M-2 is expected to expand at
a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range in February-March, considerably
more rapidly than in the previous three months, but growth at the
M-2 up to the low end of the range specified under alternative B.
The acceleration of this aggregate reflects the expected strengthening
of both M-1 and the interest-bearing component of M-2, with much of
the strength in the latter likely to result from a slowing of re-
cent unusually rapid savings account withdrawals.
","alternative B"
1979-03-20,18,"(18) Under alternative C, the Federal funds rate would rise
to the midpoint of a 10-1/4 to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and
M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 3-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent
and 3 to 7 per cent, respectively. A tightening action at this time,
while widely discussed by financial market participants in recent weeks,
does not appear to have been fully discounted, and thus market interest
rates would be expected to move up rather significantly in both long-
and short-term markets, with the increases greatest in the short-term
","alternative C"
1979-07-11,18,"(18) The staff expects M-2 to expand in a 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 per-
cent annual rate range in July-August under alternative II. As shown in
the upper panel of the chart on page 16, M-2 in June was at a level
slightly below the midpoint of its longer-run range. Growth at the
midpoint of the alternative II range would bring M-2 to about the mid-
point of its current (and also proposed alternative B) longer-run
growth range by August.
","alternative B"
1979-11-20,18,"(18) Adoption of alternative C would probably lead to some
rebound in market interest rates, as expectations that interest rates had
already peaked were disappointed. Pressures on thrift institutions would
be somewhat more intense than under alternative B, mortgage rates would
probably rise a little further, and the bank prime rate would also be under
further upward pressure. Any increase of interest rates might be quite modest
in magnitude and short-lived, however, if business news were adverse.
Nevertheless, the higher rate levels than under alternative B would tend
to hold down money demanded in early 1980, implying a decline of
interest rates early in the new year if the Committee wishes to provide
the reserves needed to keep M-1 in the first quarter of next year on the
midpoint of its longer-run growth path--assumed for these purposes to be
a 6 percent rate of growth.1/
","alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1980-01-08,18,"(18) The federal funds rate may drop to, or conceivably below,
the bottom of the 10½ to 15½ percent range specified for alternative A
over the next few weeks, and the 3-month bill rate could be in a 9 to 10
percent area. If the discount rate were not changed from the present
$200 to $300 million, and nonborrowed reserves would expand by about 15
percent over the quarter. Of course, if the discount rate were reduced
significantly under the circumstances, member bank borrowing would be
somewhat higher.
","alternative A"
1980-04-22,18,"(18) Alternative A calls for more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates than B and C, and entails almost an 11 percent annual rate of
increase in M-IA over the next two months. As indicated in the charts, M-1A
and M-1B would be somewhat above their long-run midpoint paths by June,
implying less rapid growth of the narrow money stock (and higher interest
rates) in the second half of 1980 than the other two alternatives.
","Alternative A"
1980-05-20,18,"(18) To attain the aggregates of alternative B over the May-
June period, total reserves would have to increase at a 5 percent annual
rate. With borrowing at frictional levels, as in alternative A, nonborrowed
reserves would increase at a 28 percent rate. For both alternatives A
and B, it should be pointed out that if growth of money stock deposits
and related required reserves over the weeks immediately ahead runs below
target, attainment of the nonborrowed reserve path in the short-run would
involve adding to banks' excess reserves (since there are practically no
borrowings to be paid off). This would generate downward pressure on
interest rates, of course, and possibly very substantial downward pressures,
particularly on the funds rate, if banks are not very willing to hold excess
reserves at relatively high interest rate levels. Thus, the lower limits
of the funds rate ranges could rather promptly become the operative guides
for open market operations.
Directive language
","alternative B, alternative A"
1980-07-09,18,"(18) The specifications of alternative B call for a considerable
slowing in M-2 from its May-June pace. MMMF growth, while remaining large,
is expected to slacken from its recent exceptionally rapid rate as previous
market yield declines are reflected in returns posted by the funds. Not
all of this slowdown is expected to be reflected in gains for the depository
institutions, although the 30-month small saver certificate is projected
to grow strongly. With domestic bank loan demands remaining weak, CD and
Eurodollar borrowing will continue to decline, and there will probably be
further advances from U.S. banks to their foreign branches in response
to relatively strong credit demands in Eurodollar markets.
","alternative B"
1981-07-06,18,"(18) Alternative A was designed to return M1-B to the lower
end of its longer-run range by September. This requires a 10 percent
annual rate of growth, which would, if continued, result in a fourth-
quarter average level in line with the midpoint of the 1981 range. Assuming
a fairly smooth month-by-month trajectory, the quarterly average growth of
M1-B under alternative A would be 4 percent at an annual rate, as compared
to a projected third-quarter growth of nominal GNP of about 7½ percent.
M2 would be expected to accelerate from the relatively slow growth rates
of the past two months, reflecting not only the faster growth of M1-B but
also some strengthening of the nontransactions component. To achieve the
specified monetary growth, total reserves might have to expand at a 13
percent annual rate from June to August.

1981-12-21,18,"(18) The alternative B specifications would require expansion in
total reserves at a 2 percent pace from December to March.1 / Assuming
adjustment borrowing in the $450 million area, nonborrowed reserves would
increase at a 1-1/2 percent rate and, at the present discount rate, the
federal funds rate in the intermeeting period would likely fluctuate up
in a 12 to 13 percent range. The 3-month Treasury bill could be expected
to trade in the 11 to 11-1/2 percent area, as sizable first quarter
Treasury financing demands make themselves felt in an environment in which
the money market shows no sign of easing.
","alternative B"
1982-06-30,18,"(18) Alternative A, which targets faster growth in M1 than
alternative B, could well produce a fairly substantial decline in money
market rates. An increase in total reserves on the order of 6 ¼ percent
from June to September would be consistent with the 5 ½ percent growth
rate specified for M1 during the quarter. The federal funds rate likely
would decline to a zone somewhat above the present discount rate, with
adjustment borrowing falling into the $300 to $500 million range. Assuming
borrowing were to average about $400 million, growth of nonborrowed reserves
would be 12 percent.
","Alternative A, alternative B"
1983-03-28,18,"(18) Alternative C is assumed to involve a rise in the federal
funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, and an increase in the level of
borrowing to the $500 to $700 million range. Short-term interest rates
would rise somewhat further, since the market would not appear to have
fully discounted such a tightening. The 3-month bill rate could rise to
around 9 percent and large CDs would probably be offered at 9½ percent
or higher, exerting upward pressure on the prime rate. Longer-term rates
would also rise, and the spread of the mortgage rate over the bond rate
may also widen, as lenders contemplated the cost impacts of rising deposit
rates, especially with such a large proportion of their deposits in the
form of MMDAs and MMCs. Higher U.S. interest rates would probably lead
to further upward pressure on dollar exchange rates.
Directive language
","Alternative C"
1983-05-24,18,"(18) Alternative A envisions an easing in bank reserve positions
that would help move the broader aggregates more in the direction of the
short-run path expected at the last Committee meeting, but at the same time
would probably cause M1 to move even further above the Committee's
previously held expectations for the second quarter. The alternative
envisions a drop in borrowing to near minimal levels--perhaps $100 million,
which would bring the federal funds rate down to around 8 percent. A
similar easing of money market conditions could be attained with a drop
in the discount rate to 8 percent, and borrowing to about $200 million.
","Alternative A"
1983-07-12,18,"(18) The specifications of Alternative A contemplate no further
tightening of money market conditions over the next few months. A federal
funds rate range of 6 to 10 percent is shown for this alternative, the
same as in the directive adopted at the last meeting. However, a federal
funds rate in the upper half of that range--around 9 percent or a little
higher--would be contemplated. Recent experience with borrowing at the
discount window would suggest that borrowing would tend to be in the
$450 to 600 million range. From June to September, nonborrowed and total
reserves would be expected to expand at annual rates of about 5½ and 4
percent, respectively.
","Alternative A"
1983-08-23,18,"(18) The size and speed of the tightening in money market
conditions contemplated under alternative C is probably not currently
anticipated in the market. As a result, interest rates in both short-
and long-term markets would be likely to rise appreciably. Bond issuance
by corporations and state and local governments is already quite low com-
pared to earlier in the year, but it could drop off even more. In the
mortgage market rates on conventional fixed rate mortgages would climb
above 14 per cent, with pressure on these rates accentuated by effects of
rising MMDA costs on the willingness of thrifts to extend mortgage loans.
The dollar would come under considerable upward pressure on foreign ex-
change markets, especially if foreign central banks continued to demonstrate
a reluctance to raise their domestic interest rates.
","alternative C"
1983-11-14,18,"(18) The extent of easing in money market conditions contem-
plated under alternative A would probably result in a sizable decline
in other short-term interest rates, with the 3-month Treasury bill falling
into the 8 to 8-1/2 percent area, and a decline in the dollar on foreign
exchange markets. The reaction of bond yields may be more muted, espe-
cially if incoming data indicated not only continued strength in economic
activity but also a very substantial pickup in money stock growth.
","alternative A"
1984-01-30,18,"(18) Interest rates under alternative B would be expected to
fluctuate in a narrow range around current levels over the intermeeting
period. The recent drop in short and long-term rates is not likely to carry
further, given the continued growth expected in the monetary aggregates and
expansion in credit demands at slightly more than the fourth-quarter pace.
Treasury credit demands are likely to be larger this quarter than in the
fourth, offsetting some tendency for private borrowing to slow. State and
local government bond issuance is expected to be at a relatively reduced
pace, given the legislative uncertainty about the status of some types of
revenue bonds. The increase in household mortgage and consumer installment
debt also is likely to moderate along with the slower growth of consumer
durables purchases and the relatively flat pattern of housing starts and
expenditures. Corporate borrowing, on the other hand, may be greater than
in the fourth quarter as internal fund generation levels off while spending
for capital and inventories continues to rise.
","alternative B"
1986-02-11,18,"(18) The specifications of alternative B envision a continua-
tion of discount window borrowing in a range of $300 to $400 million, with
federal funds likely to trade around 7-3/4 percent or a little higher.

Growth in M1 would be expected to pick up to near a 7 percent annual rate in

","alternative B"
1987-02-10,18,"(18) The specifications of alternative B involve maintaining a
reserve path allowance for borrowing at the discount window of $300 million.
The federal funds rate would be expected to range around 6 percent, as it
has in recent days. With funds trading consistently in this area, the three-
month Treasury bill rate might edge back down toward 5-1/2 percent. Bond
rates would be expected to continue to fluctuate around current levels as
incoming economic indicators are likely to point to continued moderate
economic expansion. The dollar could well come under some renewed downward
pressure--given persistent large current account deficits.
","alternative B"
1987-11-03,18,"(18) Alternative C calls for a slight firming of reserve pres-
sures, indexed by an increase in borrowing of only $100 million, and a rise
in the federal funds rate to 7-1/4 percent. The small increase in reserve
pressures under this alternative would better guard against substantial
further weakness in the exchange value of the dollar, but would leave bor-
rowing and the federal funds rate a bit below levels prior to the stock
market crash. Even so, the choice of alternative C before any dollar
decline were generally linked with renewed inflation concerns would risk
further disquieting domestic financial markets. A downward movement of
prices in private credit and equity markets would be likely, although if
the tightening were seen as contributing to economic weakness or damping
any incipient inflation, the rally in the Treasury bond market could be
extended. The 3-month Treasury bill rate could move into the 6-1/2 per-
cent area, with private short-term rates also rising appreciably. Growth
in the aggregates under alternative C would be retarded a little over the
rest of the quarter by the renewed upward movement in opportunity costs
on monetary assets. M2 growth would be expected to be around a 5-3/4
percent rate over September to December, though its M1 component still
would register growth around 7-1/2 percent given its October bulge. Both
aggregates would be entering the new year on fairly slow underlying growth
paths. The restraining effect on M3 would be muted as business credit
demands shifted more to banks and other short-term sources in response to
less attractive long-term financing.
Directive language
","Alternative C, alternative C, alternative C"
1988-02-09,18,"(18) M3, under alternative B, would advance at a 6 percent annual
rate from November to March as growth over February and March strengthens
somewhat from the 5 percent average of December and January. By March, M3
would be 6-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also near the center
of the tentative range. Inflows to core deposits at banks and thrifts are
likely to fall short of credit demands, leading both types of institutions
to issue a moderate volume of managed liabilities in M3. Credit growth at
banks is expected to slow somewhat in February and March from its
exceptional January pace, which was boosted by a resurgence of security
lending. Overall credit growth is forecast to increase slightly over coming
months, reflecting primarily a pickup in borrowing by the federal government
from its recent reduced pace. A continued wide financing gap along with a
quickening pace of corporate acquisitions and restructurings are expected to
give rise to sizable business credit demands. In addition to heavier
borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market, businesses are
expected to tap the bond markets to avail themselves of reduced long-term
borrowing costs. By March domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to be
around 9 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also in the middle of its
tentative range.
","alternative B"
1988-06-29,18,"(18) Market rates appear to have incorporated the recent firming of
policy, which would be retained under alternative B, and most rates should
remain near current levels over the near term. However, the prime rate may
be raised in response to recent increases in funding costs. And, the Trea-
sury bill rate could move up toward 6-3/4 percent, a more typical alignment
with the funds rate, as the Treasury resumes net issuance of bills to cover
larger financing needs. Over time, yields on long-term bonds and mortgages
could retrace some of their recent declines should incoming data fail to
show any significant easing of price pressures. A back-up in yields would
be reinforced if the dollar came under some downward pressure, for example,
because incoming data suggested a less rapid pace of reduction in external
","alternative B"
1990-12-18,18,"(18) Selection of alternative A would provide added impetus to
M2 growth but would affect M3 and credit expansion only a little, at least
over the next few months. Opportunity costs on retail balances would fall
further, lifting M2 growth to a projected 5 percent rate over the November
to March period. By March, M2 would be near the midpoint of the pro-
visional range for next year. With banks slightly more inclined to lend,
M3 growth would be stimulated a bit: Its expected 1 percent rate of
growth from November to March would place this aggregate at the lower
bound of its tentative annual range.
Directive Language
","alternative A"
1991-02-05,18,"(18) As noted above, the provisional ranges of alternative I
would seem to be broadly consistent the money and debt paths embodied in
the staff economic forecast. This alternative already represents a
reduction from the ranges of 1990 for M2 and debt. Should the Committee
wish to signal an even stronger commitment to an anti-inflation policy,
alternative II would reduce the ranges a further 1/2 percentage point.
The lower ceilings under this long-run alternative would call for a
prompter tightening of policy should the rebound in economic activity and
associated inflation outcome prove stronger than now anticipated by the
staff and carry through to more rapid money growth. The upper bounds of
this alternative also would inhibit a very vigorous easing in response to
an unexpectedly weak economy. At the same time, the reduced floors for
money growth would indicate a willingness of the Committee to tolerate
rather slow monetary expansion.
","alternative a, alternative a"
1991-03-26,18,"(18) The tighter money market conditions of alternative C would
slow M2 from the pace of December to March, holding this aggregate down to
the midpoint of its 1991 range by June. M3 growth over the three months
would moderate to a 3 percent rate, with some risk that expansion could be
even more damped if there were an appreciable adverse reaction in bank
capital and funding markets.
Directive Language
","alternative C"
1992-06-30,18,"(18) Alternative II would tend to be favored if it were
thought that the same forces acting to depress broad money in 1992 were
going to persist through next year. In the staff projections, M2 would
be squarely in the lower half of this reduced range over 1993 and M3
would be a little above the lower end of its range. Thus, this lower
range would accommodate the staff forecast of an economy that was ex-
panding at a pace slightly above its potential growth rate and infla-
tionary pressures that were continuing to abate. While encompassing
more scope for downward shifts in money demand, this alternative also
would embody less room for an acceleration in M2 growth that might
threaten progress toward price stability and greater scope for a rise in
interest rates were that needed to preserve the downtrend in inflation
or to seek an even faster deceleration than in the staff forecast.
","alternative a"
2000-06-27,18,"(18) If the Committee is not sure that inflation pressures will intensify going
forward, then it might want to consider leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged at
this meeting, as under alternative B. Economic growth in the second quarter appears to
have slowed to a rate roughly consistent with its potential even though the full effects of the
earlier rise in interest rates and flattening of equity prices have not yet worked their way
through the pipeline. Moreover, as noted, market participants have interpreted the incoming
data as suggesting that very little further tightening might be necessary to contain inflation.
In these circumstances, the Committee might wish to wait for more evidence on the likely
extent of the slowdown in aggregate demand before taking further action. In addition, the
Committee may be less convinced than the staff that the economy is producing beyond the
level of its potential. Recent data are giving conflicting signals about the acceleration of labor
compensation, and, in any case, the growth of structural productivity has picked up. In view
of the resulting uncertainty regarding unit labor costs, the Committee may have significant
doubts that an upswing of inflation is in train. Judging by survey evidence, longer-term
inflation expectations have not been particularly sensitive to short-run fluctuations in
measured inflation. As a result, the Committee might anticipate that those expectations will
not rise much in the near term, even if the incoming data tend to confirm the staffs forecast,
and might view the costs of waiting for additional information as rather low.
","alternative B"
2001-01-30,18,"(18) The Committee may choose the unchanged federal funds rate of
alternative B if it is dissatisfied with recent rates of core inflation  and wants to
establish a downward trajectory for inflation, as in the price stability scenario in the
second section of this bluebook.  The rationale for this policy choice would be
strengthened if the Committee saw the recent slowdown in the  growth of aggregate
demand as likely to be more temporary than does the staff and thus the recent policy
easing as probably sufficient to counter the sluggishness in the econom y that emerged
recently.  Regard less of the balance of risks statement, leaving the funds rate
unchanged would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and would
spark a sell-off in asset markets as participants reassessed the economic outlook and
the Committees posture.  The backup in interest rates and drop in equity prices
would prompt still more caution on the part of loan officers and investors.
","alternative B"
2004-06-29,18,"(18) The combination of policy action and explanation proposed under
Alternative C would come as a considerable shock to market participants.  Most
investors appear to view the Committees measured language, in the context of the
recent data as well as comments from policymakers, as essentially ruling out such an
opening move and accordingly have positioned for a 25-basis-point increase.  The
accompanying indication that the inflation risks were tilted to the upside would
reinforce the sense that the trajectory of policy tightening would be significantly
steeper than previously anticipated.  In all likelihood under this alternative, market
interest rates would rise across the yield curve, stock prices would drop sharply, and
the foreign exchange value of the dollar would increase.
","Alternative C"
2004-08-10,18,"(18) If the Committee favors only a modest firming in policy at this time but
wishes to move away from the measured pace language before long, it might wish
to combine the 25-basis-point firming action and rationale of Alternative B
with the conditional assessment of upside risks proposed for Alternative C.
That assessment would imply a need for continued policy tightening and thus could
facilitate dropping the measured pace language, perhaps even at this meeting.  If that
language were dropped on Tuesday, the market reaction to the announcement of
conditional upside risks could be fairly sharp, approaching that expected under
Alternative C, as market participants would probably conclude that the FOMC no
longer believed that policy tightening was likely to be gradual.  But if the measured
pace wording were retained for this meeting, the response might be rather muted,
with perhaps a small rise in market yields and a modest decline in equity prices.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
An Update
Attached is an exhibit that details the market reaction to this mornings
employment report and a revised version of table 1 from the Bluebook.  As shown in
the top panel of the market reaction exhibit, interest rates and policy expectations
registered substantial increases following the release of the employment report.  As of
structure.  Treasury inflation-indexed yields rose nearly as much as comparable-
maturity nominal yields, suggesting that much of the market response was attributable
to an upward revision in the markets outlook for real economic activity.  The
November federal funds futures contract ticked up a half basis point, putting the
implied probability of a quarter-point tightening at the upcoming meeting at 90
percent.  Further-ahead futures rates were marked up as much as 20 basis points, as
investors evidently concluded that a more vigorous expansion would likely be
accompanied by more rapid policy tightening than they had previously expected.
The bottom left panel of the exhibit displays the option-implied probability
distribution for the employment report outcome based on the economic derivatives
auction held at 8:00 a.m. today.  As noted by the vertical line, the reported increase of
sizable market reaction.  But, as noted at the right, the market reaction was sizable
even controlling for the magnitude of the surprise.  For example, the response of the
ten-year Treasury yielddenoted by the blue squarewas larger than would have
been predicted based upon a historical event-study regression (shown by the thin
black line) but was quite close to the regression line based on experience over the last
year (the red line) during which markets have appeared especially sensitive to news
bearing on labor market conditions.
In view of the sizable employment gains reported for October and the upward
revisions for the prior two months, as well as comments from several members, the
staff has revised Bluebook table 1.  The revised table eliminates alternative A and
incorporates a new variation on alternative B that is labeled alternative B.  The new
alternative does not hint that the Committee is entertaining the possibility of a pause.
As a result, the language of alternative B incorporates only minimal changes to the
wording of the September FOMC statement.  Alternatives B and C in the revised
table are slightly revised for clarity, with material struck out in rows three and four.

2005-02-01,18,"(18) Even if the Committee prefers a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting, it
may wish to couple such a move with some of the changes in the announcement
listed under Alternative C in Table 1.  For instance, to suggest greater uncertainty
about the pace of structural productivity growth, the announcement could simply
speak of the underlying growth in productivity as helping to support economic
activity, without characterizing productivity growth as robust.  To signal a relatively
greater concern about the inflation outlook, the Committee could note in the rationale
paragraph that labor market conditions continue to improve, without indicating that
the improvement was gradual, and also mention that rising business costs have the
potential to put upward pressure on prices.  The Committee could also drop the
measured pace language, although, in the absence of other changes in the balance-
of-risks framework, that would place a greater burden on the rationale paragraph to
guide market participants expectations for policy, at least until release of the minutes
three weeks later.  If the Committee did choose to firm 50 basis points at this
meeting, the draft language in Table 1 would serve to clarify that the larger move was
not intended to presage a pause.
","Alternative C"
2005-05-03,18,"(18) As indicated in Table 1, the Committee could consider a number of
alterations to its statement in association with the selection of Alternative C to
convey a heightened concern about inflation prospects.  For example, the
Committee could strike the reference to robust underlying growth in productivity
in the second sentence.  In addition, it could choose not to focus on the apparent
recent slowing in output growth and simply note that output continues to grow at a
pace sufficient to eliminate any remaining resource slack.  With regard to inflation,
the Committee would probably wish to delete the sentence in the previous
announcement that The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through
to core consumer prices.  Given the conditioning assumption of appropriate
monetary policy, the Committee could retain its assessment that the risks to
attainment of sustainable growth and price stability are balanced.  However, if the
Committee wanted to gain flexibility to tighten policy at a faster pace in the future, it
presumably would delete the risk assessment and the sentence expressing its belief
that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.
(The characterization that policy is accommodative elsewhere in the statement
would remain as the sole signal of the direction of future action.)  Even after these
deletions, the Committee might wish to underscore that its future actions would
depend on evolving economic outcomes by indicating, with a nod to its dual
objectives, that The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as
needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic
growth and price stability.

","Alternative C"
2005-06-29,18,"(18) Market participants continue to expect that the path of the intended federal
funds rate will flatten out somewhat in the second half of the year, but market
commentary and survey evidence suggest that investors do not anticipate that the
FOMC will overtly signal any such development next week.  Accordingly, a statement
employing the draft wording shown in Alternative A would likely produce a
noticeable downward shift in money market futures quotes, a rally in bond and equity
markets, and some depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The
extent of the rally, however, would likely be limited by the clear implication that some
further tightening was still likely in prospect.  Policy uncertainty arguably could
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 42
increase a little, as market participants might become a little less sure as to the timing
and magnitude of remaining policy actions.
","Alternative A"
2005-08-09,18,"(18) Market participants would no doubt be taken aback by the combination of a
suggested for Alternative C.  Investors might infer that policy firming in the current
cycle would likely bring the funds rate appreciably above 4¼ percent, the peak funds
rate that seems to be currently incorporated in market prices.  Moreover, with the
elimination of the measured-pace language, market participants might come to believe
that at least some of that rate gap could be covered in additional 50-basis-point
strides.  With the expected policy path pushed sharply upward and little forward-
looking guidance provided by the FOMC, investors uncertainty regarding the future
path of policy would likely increase.  In all likelihood, the upward revision to policy
expectations would trigger a sell-off in fixed-income and equity markets and a rise in
the foreign-exchange value of the dollar, although the increase in long-term yields and
appreciation of the dollar could be limited if the drop in share prices were especially
sharp.  If the FOMC were particularly concerned about inflation pressures but was
not prepared to hike rates 50 basis points at this meeting, it could couple a quarter-
point move with some of the changes in the statement suggested for Alternative C.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 35
Such a pairing would temper the surprise to market participants, but it would
probably still lead them to mark up significantly their expectations of policy firming.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2006-01-31,18,"(18) Under Alternative C, the wording proposed for the inflation outlook, line 3,
would indicate slightly greater concern about the potential for increases in resource
utilization as well as energy and other cost pressures to boost underlying inflation.
The assessment of risks could be quite similar to that announced following the
December meeting, including a statement that some further measured policy firming
is likely to be needed to maintain balanced risks to price stability and sustainable
growth.  Markets would probably see the language under Alternative C as indicating a
greater probability of future policy tightening than they had expected.  Short- and
intermediate-term interest rates would likely rise with the revisions to the markets
expected path for the funds rate.  The stock market might fall back a little, but longer-
term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would not
change much.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2006-05-10,18,"(18) The policy action and statement associated with Alternative C would catch
market participants unawares.  Real bond yields could jump up noticeably; the rise in
nominal yields would be somewhat less if inflation expectations declinedbut that
would depend on the extent to which investors took the action as an assertion of the
Committees anti-inflation resolve.  The recent tendency toward weakness in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be checked, and stock prices would
decline.  Given the size of the policy surprise, volatility, both actual and implied, could
","Alternative C"
2006-06-28,18,"(18) The rationale paragraph under Alternative C could place more emphasis on
the recent unwelcome pickup in inflation while noting that productivity gains and
contained inflation expectations are restraining inflation.  To signal that further
tightening is likely, the risk assessment could indicate that additional policy action may
be needed to reduce core inflation to a more desirable level.  So that the Committee
would not become locked into additional tightening even if there were additional
elevated monthly readings on core inflation, the assessment could specify that the
reduction in core inflation was sought in the medium term and repeat that the extent
and timing of firming would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.
","Alternative C"
2006-08-08,18,"(18) The Committee may judge instead that an additional 25 basis point increase
in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in Alternative C, is needed to bring the
risks to the outlook for inflation and economic growth into better balance.  A firming
at this meeting might be appropriate if the staffs inflation forecast were seen as likely
and generally acceptable but the Committee wished to have slightly greater assurance
that inflation would diminish in coming quarters.  Members might worry that inflation
pressures could turn out to be a little greater than projected in the Greenbook.  The
economy has proved quite resilient in the face of higher oil prices and tighter
monetary policy over the past two years, and members may see economic growth as
most likely to rebound from its sharply slower pace in the second quarter.  In light of
the recent upside surprises in price data, raising the federal funds rate at this meeting
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 39
might also seem desirable as a signal of the Committees resolve to foster a decline in
inflation.  Even with the firming action under this alternative, the Committee may
judge that significant upside risks to inflation remain.  However, some members may
see the slowing in the expansion of aggregate demand of late as suggesting that the
downside risks to growth have increased since the last meeting.  The Committee
might see Alternative C as bringing the risks to the attainment of its growth and price
stability objectives roughly in balance and believe that, after implementation of such a
policy choice, an easing and a tightening of policy are about equally probable.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2006-09-20,18,"(18) If the FOMC expected stronger growth or higher inflation than the staff, or
if it saw the Greenbook forecast as credible but was unhappy with the forecast path
for inflation, it might wish to take another firming step at this meeting, as in
Alternative C.   The Committees concerns about the inflation outlook may have
been exacerbated by recent compensation and productivity data.  Moreover, in the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 36
staff projection, core PCE inflation is projected to remain a bit above 2 percent until
late 2008an outcome that would mark five consecutive years of elevated core
inflation relative to the objectives cited by a number of members of the Committee.
Overall inflation likewise is forecast to remain relatively high until 2008.  Given this
forecast, members may believe that acceptable progress toward price stability will
likely involve a somewhat firmer stance of monetary policy over coming quarters than
assumed by the staff.  Even if the Committee found the rate of decline in inflation
forecast in the Greenbook to be generally acceptable, it might wish to firm policy
another step at this meeting to provide more assurance that inflation was headed
","Alternative C"
2006-12-12,18,"(18) The description of the prospects for growth in the statement associated
with Alternative C could be identical to that suggested for Alternative B.  However, in
the inflation paragraph, rather than listing the various factors contributing to the
expected moderation in inflation, the Committee could indicate that Inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that
moderation are uncertain.  The discussion of inflation could conclude by stating that
In these circumstances, the Committee believed that an additional firming of policy
was appropriate to foster the achievement of price stability.  And if, despite the
firming in policy, the Committee remained concerned that inflation would not
moderate as desired, it could underscore its commitment to price stability by
modifying the first sentence of the risk assessment to note that Although the
Committee both seeks and expects a gradual reduction in inflation, it continues to
view the risks to that outcome as to the upside.
","Alternative C, Alternative B"
2007-01-30,18,"(18) In light of the improvement in the outlook for inflation during the
intermeeting period and the persistence of downside risks arising from the substantial
cooling of the housing market, the Committee may now judge that the risks to the
attainment of its dual objectives are roughly balanced, as in Alternative A.  Removing
the bias toward further tightening would leave the Committee better positioned to
respond to the adverse effects of a possible further deterioration in residential
construction or spillovers to consumer spending, along the lines of the more
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 38
extensive housing correction alternative Greenbook scenario.  Even absent such
concerns, the expected path for inflation is somewhat lower than in December,
implying that the real federal funds rate is poised to edge highera development that
the Committee may view as reducing the likelihood of policy tightening in the near
term.  Furthermore, the Committee might see core inflation as declining faster than in
the staff forecast because, for instance, it perceives less tightness in labor markets than
the staff (a possibility suggested by the lower NAIRU alternative Greenbook
scenario), or because it is more optimistic about the disinflationary impetus from
lower energy and other commodity prices and the stronger foreign exchange value of
the dollar.
","Alternative A"
2007-03-20,18,"(18) The language associated with Alternative B could point to gains in personal
income and consumer spending as helping to sustain output in the face of weakness
in housing and business investment.  If the Committees view on inflation has not
changed appreciably of late, it could choose to repeat the backward-looking language
that readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months along
with the forward-looking language that inflation pressures seem likely to moderate
over time and the qualification that high resource utilization could sustain inflation
pressures.   The assessment of risk language for Alternative B contains no explicit
judgment about the balance of risks.  However, by stating that the risk that inflation
will fail to moderate as expected remains its principal policy concern, the Committee
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 41
would implicitly acknowledge risks to growth.  The proposed wording in Alternative
B replaces the reference to additional firming that was in the January statement with
a balanced characterization of future policy adjustments, thereby removing the
presumption that the next change in policy will be a tightening and providing greater
policy flexibility going forward.
","Alternative B, Alternative B, Alternative

2007-06-27,18,"(18) The draft statement accompanying Alternative B reiterates the view that the
economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Following
benign inflation readings, the draft language drops both the characterization of the
level of core inflation as somewhat elevated and the prediction that inflation seems
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 42
likely to moderate from its current level.  Instead, the statement acknowledges the
recent favorable information while expressing the view that the high level of resource
utilization has the potential to sustain price pressures.  This language would be
intended to indicate that incoming data point to a slowing in core inflation but, given
that monthly inflation readings are noisy, to suggest that the Committee is awaiting
more data before being satisfied that the moderation in inflation will be sustained.
The statement would conclude by indicating that the Committees predominant policy
concern remains the upside risk to inflation, with the language modified for
consistency with the inflation paragraph.
","Alternative B"
2007-08-07,18,"(18) If the Committee continues to view the current stance of policy as likely to
foster sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation, then it may wish
to choose Alternative B, under which its target for the federal funds rate would
remain at 5¼ percent for the time being.  The real federal funds rate is close to its
Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value (Chart 5), supporting a view that the current
stance of policy is likely to promote a gradual easing of pressures on resources.
Additionally, the current target for the funds rate remains close to prescriptions for
near-term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation
goal (Chart 6) and some of the policy rules shown in Chart 7.  The Committee might
agree with the staffs assessment that recent developments in financial markets are
unlikely to impose substantial restraint on aggregate demand, given that credit remains
readily available to most households and businesses.  The Committee might also agree
with the staffs view that, after a relatively brief interruption as the markets reassess
credit risk, normal flows of credit probably will resume, though with risk spreads
above the unusually low levels seen in the past few years.  Even if the Committee is
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 43
less sanguine than the staff, members might decide that more concrete information
about the economic effect of less readily available credit would be needed to warrant a
change in the stance of monetary policy.  Moreover, the Committee might judge that
maintaining its current policy stance would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks
to its dual objectives:  On the one hand, weakness in housing and strains in credit
markets could have a more pronounced effect on overall economic activity than
foreseen in the staff forecast; on the other, the moderation in inflation may not be

2007-10-30,18,"(18) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Alternative A lowers the target federal funds
rate 25 basis points to 4½ percent, while Alternatives B and C leave the target rate
unchanged at 4¾ percent.  In the rationale paragraph, all three alternatives recognize
that economic growth was solid in the third quarter.  (The advance report for third-
quarter GDP growth will be published on October 31, the second day of the FOMC
meeting.  The staff and most private sector forecasters expect that output grew
significantly faster than potential last quarter.  If third-quarter growth turns out to be
considerably above or below expectations, strong or moderate perhaps could be
substituted for solid.)  All three alternatives also acknowledge that strains in
financial markets have eased somewhat on balance and suggest that the Committee
expects some slowing of the pace of economic expansion in the near term.
Alternative A alludes to the possibility that the tightening of credit conditions since
earlier this year could restrain economic growth, and Alternative B makes that point
more directly.  Because recent inflation readings have continued to be relatively
benign but have not shown signs of further moderation, Alternatives A and B
maintain the language regarding inflation used in the September statement.  In
contrast, Alternative C states that the high level of resource utilization and recent
increases in energy prices may put renewed upward pressures on both overall and
core inflation.  While considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains,
the three alternatives assume that the Committee is prepared to resume the practice of
assessing the balance of risks to growth and inflation.  Alternatives A and C
characterize the downside risks to growth as roughly balancing the upside risks to

Risk Management Strategies
Simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks  
 for monetary policy.  However, such rules are generally  
 specified in terms of the modal forecast and hence  
 abstract from risk management considerations.  In this  
 box, we gauge the benefits and costs of alternative  
 policy strategies using the version of the FRB/US model
 in which expectations of the private sector are formed  
 based on past economic data.  As a point of reference, 
suppose that the Greenbook outlook is the best feasible  under current circumstances, at least in the absence of  uncertainty.
Now consider the Recession scenario presented in  
 the Greenbook alternative simulations.  When monetary 
 policy is determined by the Bluebooks Outcome-Based  
 Rule (dotted lines), the federal funds rate declines  
 gradually in response to incoming data, reaching a trough 
 of about ¾ percent in late 2009 before returning to the 
 Greenbook baseline a few years later.  With this policy, 
 the unemployment rate rises a bit above 6 percent next 
 year and takes about five years to return to the NAIRU, 
 while core PCE inflation falls well below the assumed  
long-run inflation goal of 1¾ percent.
If policymakers could instantly be sure that such a   recession was already in train, they might well cut the  
 funds rate target immediately to a rate below 1 percent 
in order to reduce the severity of the downturn.  In reality, 
 of course, economic turning points are notoriously difficult 
 to predict or even to identify contemporaneously.  Thus, 
 policymakers might prefer to take out some insurance by 
 easing the stance of policy even before the onset of 
 recession was fully evident.
Such an approach is illustrated by the Risk Management  
path (solid lines), in which the funds rate target is   
reduced to 1½ percent for two quarters and thereafter  follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.    This policy has visible effects in stabilizing economic   activity and inflation:  The unemployment rate at the peak 
 of the recession is about ¼ percentage point lower than 
 in the absence of insurance, and the inflation rate stays 
 noticeably closer to the assumed long-run inflation goal  
 of 1¾ percent.

It is also important to gauge the costs that would be  
incurred in following such a risk management strategy  
if in fact no recession occurs.  For this purpose, suppose 
that economic conditions unfold as in the Greenbook 
baseline (dotted lines) but that policymakers have  
taken out some insurance against the risk of recession  
by lowering the target funds rate to 1½ percent for  
two quarters.
In the Prompt Reversal case (solid lines), the strength  
of economic activity is assumed to be recognized  
quickly and the policy insurance is then removed;  
indeed, policy is tightened somewhat further to offset  
the effects of the initial policy stimulus, and thereafter 
follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.   
In this case, the funds rate target rises almost a percentage 
point above the Greenbook baseline path by the end  
of this year.  With this policy path, core inflation  
remains very close to the Greenbook baseline while  
the unemployment rate only deviates temporarily.
In contrast, in the case of Gradual Reversal (dashed lines), 
the strength of economic activity is assumed to become 
evident only over a longer period, and hence the policy  
insurance is removed over the course of a year rather  
than in a single quarter; that is, after the first two  
quarters, the funds rate is adjusted according to the  
empirical outcome-based rule, which responds only 
gradually to incoming data.  This path of policy  
generates persistent deviations of unemployment and 
inflation from the Greenbook baseline; even at the end  
of 2012, core inflation remains nearly a quarter point  
above the assumed long-run inflation goal of 1¾ percent.

this policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote
moderate growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity but notes
that downside risks to growth remain and emphasizesas in the January 22
statementthat the Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to address
those risks.

Preliminary Corrections for Money Supply Bias in 1970
For some time it has been apparent that current measure of
monetary growth were being distorted, as bank float increased more than,
deposits at large banks.l/ In 1969, the money supply s-rLes was, re-
vised upward to take account of bills payable and London checks, but
this revision only partially corrected the series for the downward bias
arising from international transfers. To attempt to measure the remain-
ing bias, the staff has obtained additional information from several
sources in preparation for a revision of the money supply series this
fall. While this information is not yet complete, some rough estimates
have been made of monthly average corrections that may be appropriate
for 1970.
Effects on growth rates as currently measured
Table 1 compares growth rates in M as current measured and
as corrected for the estimated bias. The corrected growth rate. indicate
expansion over the first half of 1970 at a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate,
compared to 4 per cent for the published series, and for the first eight
months of the year at 5.9 per cent, as compared with 5 per cent for
the published series. As had been anticipated, the largest adjustment
is for the second quarter. However, the second quarter adjustment will
be larger than the 1 percentage point previously indicated in the Blue
Book of June 19.
In the third quarter the growth rate will probably be lower
by about 1 percentage point after correction for bias. This level of
the money supply in the third quarter will be higher than published aft -
bias correction. But the effect of tne sources of bias on the rate of
growth depends on how the amount of bias is changing relative to the
change in private demand deposits; for the rate f ~L. :o 'e biased
downward, the amount of bias would have to be e pu:lng a- a faster rate
than private demand deposits. In fact, during the third quarter the
amount of bias in the published figures is expected to decline, thus
leading to a fairly significant overstatement in the actual rate of growth
when measured by the figures as presently published. The expected decline
in bias in the published figures is in large part attributable to termina-
tion of use of ""guerilla"" drafts at three major New York City banks, as
explained below.
Estimates of bias
Table 2 provides monthly average estimates of four sources of
bias. Edge Act Corporations and agencies of foreign banks are not repre-
sented in commercial banking statistics from which the money supply series
is constituted, so their demand deposits are not included at present. Yet
these institutions are responsible for a very large daily volume of Euro-
dollar and foreign exchange transactions which clear through their major
New York City correspondents. New York banks account for these trans-
actions by crediting cash items in process of collection and debiting due
to banks. Deduction of these cash items from the money supply is in-
appropriate so long as the demand deposits of Edge Corporations (which
to a great extent represent official checks written in repayment of Euro-
dollar borrowings by their parent) and agencies are excluded.
Edge Corporations submit daily deposit reports to the New York
FRB in the same form as those provided by member banks. Hence, their
demand deposits other than interbank can be added to the money supply as
an offset to the cash items generated by these institutions. Such deposits
consist mainly of checks written but not yet cleared, judging from their
parallel movement with New York City bank cash items over European holiday
periods. Transactions of Edge Corporations are responsible for the largest
portion of the estimated current bias in money supply statistics. This
source of bias increased in the first half of 1970, but it has declined
slightly since mid-year.
The basis for correcting bias associated with the foreign
agencies is much less satisfactory, although it is known that the effect
of agency transactions is similar to that for Edge Corporations. The only
information available from agencies currently is in month-end condition
reports to the New York State Banking Commisioner. These single-date
reports lack standardized depcsit figures, making it difficult to estimate
their contribution to money supply bias directly from the deposits that
give rise to it. However, our investigation suggests that figures on ""due
from U.S. banks and trust companies"", as reported by the agencies, is a
suitable proxy for the agency cash items submitted to New York City banks
for collection. Table 1 reflects totals for 25 foreign agencies operating
in New York. This single-date, indirect measure of agency activity leaves
considerable room for error in the bias correction, but it. appears to he
the best retrospective information available. It is estimated that agency
transactions declined in importance in the first quarter, but rose above
year-end levels by mid-year. As explained below, it is planned to obtain
more representative data directly from the agencies to carry the money
supply series forward after revision.
The other major component of bias included in these estimates
is the so-called ""guerilla draft"". This accounting device was utilized
by a few large banks from late 1969 until recently to obtain reserve bene-
fits under both Regulations D and M. Such transfers involved ""guerilla""
or clearing house checks drawn by foreign agencies at the request of a
U.S. bank but which do not appear on the books of a foreign agency.
They had the effect of generating cash items at New York banks which
collected the drafts without any corresponding debits to demand deposits
included in the money supply. This practice resulted in downward bias
in both levels and rates of growth of the money supply throughout the
first half of 1970, but its termination recently will reduce the amount
of bias in third quarter estimates significantly.
The smallest component of measurable bias, as indicated by
figures on Table 2, is the net effect of transactions through the
relatively new Clearing House International Payments System (CHIPS).
A large volume of international transactions are now cleared by major
New York banks through CHIPS by means of electronic equipment tied into
a clearing house computer. Until recently it was by no means certain
that these clearings were introducing only small errors into money
supply measurement. The problem for money supply statistics evolved
from changes in statistical reporting with the advent of this computer
clearing system. Some banks, but not all, began reporting payments and
receipts through CHIPS as due to and due from banks, respectively, where
formerly they reported officers checks and cash items. Other banks main
tained their former reporting practice. Depending on the pairing of
banks with mixed reporting methods, money supply data could be overstated
or understated by such transactions. CHIPS began operation in April,
with the volume of payments increasing to several billion dollars
currently. The clearing house has provided daily data on these trans-
actions which indicate very little net effect up to now. The staff is
currently negotiating with other regulatory agencies to achieve standard-
ized reporting. This will eliminate distortions from this source.
On balance, the total measurable downward bias in the level
of the money supply is estimated to have increased from about $3 billion
at the end of 1969 to about $4-1/2 billion at mid-year. Since June, the
total bias has been reduced about $500 million, reflecting mainly termina-
tion of the use of guerilla drafts in response to Mr. Hayes' August 13
letter to New York City banks. No information is yet available for banks
outside New York on the possible use--if any--of this or similar devices
that might affect the money supply.
Plans for money supply revision
The bias corrections discussed above are still too rough to
publish. Moreover, it would be desirable to extend these corrections
back as far as the adjustments appear significant to avoid a break in
series. It would also be desirable to obtain better information on
foreign agency transactions for purposes of carrying the corrected
series forward. These tasks, as well as the annual benchmark and season-
al factor revision, have been given a high priority by the staff, and a
major revision incorporating all of these elements will be published this
fall, probably around the end of October.
Appendix -4-
It should be noted that the proposed corrections for trans-
actions of Edge Act Corporations and foreign agencies will require con-
tinued attention as the money supply series is carried forward. This
situation will change when Euro-dollar and foreign exchange transactions
are converted from clearing house to Federal funds settlement. Such
Federal funds settlement will eliminate the cash items bias discussed
above. However, implementation of such a system will require close
cooperation between the Federal Reserve, commercial banks, and other
institutions involved in international transactions.

","alternative A"
1971-02-09,19,"(19) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides that past shortfalls are to be made up
over a period extending through the second quarter, and that the target
for growth of M1 in the first and second quarters should be set at 7
per cent. The Committee might choose such an approach in order to avoid
the type of ""whipsawing' of money market conditions that paragraph (9)
suggests would be required to achieve annual rates of growth for M1 of
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money
market conditions consistent with those objectives [DEL: taking
account of the forthcoming Treasury financing].""
As will be noted, the language of alternative B differs from that of
alternative A only in the omission of the clause (following the reference
to the narrowly defined money stock) reading ""making up the shortfall
from the desired growth path that has developed."" Such a clause might
be considered unnecessary in this alternative in light of the extended
period over which the shortfall is to be made up.
","Alternative B, alternative B, alternative A"
1971-05-11,19,"(19) Alternative C presents the staff's best estimate as of
this moment of the money market conditions required to rapidly move M 1
back to the growth path previously desired by the Committee for the second
quarter, and assuming M1 growth at a 6 per cent rate in the third quarter.
A wide and high range of 6 to 8 per cent for the funds rate is presented,
partly to allow for the sharp increase in interest rates that might be
required to dampen money demand over a short period of time. For instance
in May and June, growth in M1 would have to be reduced to a 2-1/2 per cent
annual rate under this alternative. The higher interest rates likely to be
associated with this M1 behavior would have a considerable dampening effect
on growth in time deposits other than large CD's, and growth in M2 would be
further constrained, with about a 7-1/2 per cent rate expected for the second
quarter. Growth in the credit proxy would likely be quite small. Even
though banks are assumed to bid more aggressively for large CD's and perhaps
non-deposit funds as growth in demand deposits and consumer-type time
deposits diminish, bank credit would be expected to rise by only a 2-1/2
per cent annual rate over the second quarter under this alternative.

if the Committee decides to call for maintaining about the money market
conditions that have recently been attained, subject to a proviso clause.

achieve more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over
the months ahead, taking account of developments in capital

TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE CURRENT TREASURY FINANCING AND OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN CAPITAL MARKETS, IF IT APPEARS THAT THE
MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING
THE GROWTH PATHS EXPECTED.""
If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money
market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as a description
of ""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause to adopt
the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alternative A
been
as the ""expected"" paths. The proviso clause has/formulated in one-way terms,
guarding against excesses but not shortfalls, on the assumption that the
Committee would not want money market conditions to be eased in the coming
period if the aggregates should fall short of the indicated paths. The
proposed language contemplates that in making operating decisions under the
proviso clause the Manager would take account of both the current Treasury
financing and developments in capital markets.

possible use if the Committee decides to continue to formulate the primary
instruction in terms of aggregates, and to seek the growth rates over the
months ahead discussed earlier in connection with alternative B-including
first-quarter rates of 7 and 8-1/2 per cent for M1 and M2, respectively. This
s the same language as that in the directive adopted at the November
meeting except that the reference to ""credit"" aggregates is deleted. The
deletion is proposed because the credit proxy is not expected to grow more
rapidly on balance in the months ahead than in the fourth quarter.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
somewhat greater growth in monetary [DEL: and credit] aggregates over

ing bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that

1973-01-16,19,"(19) Long-term interest rates may not rise very much under
alternative A, but would probably show greater upward adjustments, at
least in the short-run, under alternatives B and C. Demands on bond
markets can be expected to be generally moderate this month and next.
The near-term forward calendar of new corporate and municipal issues
is relatively modest in size, although there are indications that the
volume could build up in the spring. Mortgage market demands, though
remaining large in volume, appear to have crested. Pressures on long-
term rates are thus most likely to come from the supply side, as.banks
and other institutional investors find that their inflows of funds are
dropping off or becoming significantly more expensive--conditions most
likely to develop under alternatives B and C. Bank interest in secur-
ities and mortgages is likely to be lessened in any event as business
loan demands continue strong, partly to help businesses finance the
anticipated acceleration in the rate of inventory accumulation.

the differences in specified future movement of the aggregates relative to

developments is included in alternative C since the relatively sharp tightening
of money market conditions contemplated could lead to undesirably rapid
adjustments in credit markets generally.

1974-04-15,19,"(19) Under alternative A, savings inflows to thrift institutions
would be expected to recover to close to their first-quarter pace, as
receding market rates provide less competition for savings funds. At
banks, deposits inflows--both demand and consumer-type time and savings--
would probably be well sustained. As a result, credit demands could be
financed without banks adding to pressures on credit markets through
aggressive issuance of large CD's or reductions in portfolio liquidity.
Proposed directive language
","alternative A"
1974-05-21,19,"(19) To achieve the even greater restraint on monetary ex-
pansion called for under alternative C, the Federal funds rate would be
expected to rise to around 13 per cent over the next few weeks. The
time and savings deposits experience at banks and thrift institutions
would be expected to deteriorate further--with deposit flows at thrift
institutions probably negative as the Treasury bill rate adjusted
sharply upward, perhaps to near 10 per cent.

1976-01-20,19,"(19) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in
terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and
are intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
discussed in the preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed in
the event that the Committee wishes to continue to formulate its instructions
in terms of money market conditions and wishes to maintain the conditions
now prevailing. No special reference to the Treasury's quarterly financing
to be announced on January 27 is proposed because Treasury financings have
been, and for some time will continue to be, frequent.

","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1977-04-19,19,"(19) If the growth in M1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period is
to be constrained to around the mid-point of the 3½-5½ per cent longer-
run range of alternative C, further firming in money market conditions
would probably be required as the year progresses. Pressures on financial
institutions would, of course, intensify. The staff expects that the
Federal funds rate would have to rise to about 6¼ per cent in the third
quarter and 7¼ per cent by early 1978.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1977-07-19,19,"(19) We would expect the funds rate to begin rising in the fall
under alternative A if growth in the aggregates is to remain around the
midpoints of the longer-run ranges for this alternative. Given the degree
of near-term ease assumed, the funds rate by spring may have to be at or
slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative B in order
to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated
rate. Meanwhile, however, for most of the one-year period ahead, short-
term rates would have been lower than under alternative B, with consequent
relatively easier credit and liquidity conditions at banks and other
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative B"
1978-01-17,19,"(19) Even though this alternative is consistent with a shift
to higher long-term growth ranges for the aggregates, the decline in
the funds rate would soon have to be reversed in order to keep the aggre-
gates within the longer-run ranges of alternative A. The funds rate
would probably have to begin rising late in the first quarter and
reach a high of 7-3/4 per cent by fall. The delayed rise in short-
term rates would postpone the need for a change in deposit rate
Directive language
","alternative A"
1978-02-28,19,"(20) The near-term increase in interest rates under alterna-
tive C would work toward a reduction in growth of the aggregates over
the longer run. However, given the projected strength of money demand,
a further increase in interest rates would be required in order to limit
M-1 expansion to the mid-point of the 4 to 6 per cent alternative C range
over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period. The staff would expect the funds rate
under this alternative to average 7-3/4 per cent in the second quarter
and to rise to 8-1/4 per cent by fall.
","alternative C"
1978-04-18,19,"(19) The near-term increase in interest rates under
alternative C would be a step toward reducing the longer-run rate
of growth of the monetary aggregates, but further upward adjustments
in interest rates over the coming year would be required to limit M-1
growth to the mid-point of its 4 to 6 per cent longer-run range.
The funds rate would probably have to rise to 9 per cent by late
this year.
","alternative C"
1978-07-18,19,"(19) Interest rates on longer term securities are also
likely to be little changed under alternative B. Corporate
bond offerings are expected to increase in July, but the forward
calendar for August is seasonally light. In the municipal sector,
new bond issuance is anticipated to fall further over the summer,
as the normal seasonal lull is reinforced by a continued lack of
advance refunding operations, recently discouraged by changes in
IRS regulations and the previous rise in bond yields. Over the
intermeeting period, the Treasury is likely to obtain a sizable
amount of new cash in conjunction with a regular issue of two-year
technical position, however, with security dealers carrying large
net short positions in coupon issues. As bond yields remain little
changed, while thrift deposit flows are sustained at around current
levels, mortgage rates are also likely to stay fairly stable.
I/ The terms of this refunding are to be announced in late July.
The staff expects the Treasury to sell $6 to $6 billion of new
securities in this operation, rolling over $4k billion of
publicly-held debt issues maturing on August 15, and raising
about $14 to $2 billion of new money.
","alternative B"
1978-12-19,19,"(19) If M-1, as expected, expands at a 4 per cent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, the longer-run growth range for this
aggregate implies an M-1 growth over the first three quarters of 1979
at a 2¾ per cent annual rate.1/ Assuming the staff's current GNP
projections and some downward shift in money demand, the staff believes
that such growth in M-1 is generally consistent with the Federal funds
rate ranges shown in Appendix I. Reflecting monetary restraint already
in train, the midpoint of alternative A would call for no further rise
in the funds rate over the longer-run policy period. The alternative
B pattern contemplates that an increase in the funds rate to a little
over 10 per cent in the intermeeting period would be maintained through
the first quarter of 1979. This additional restraint on monetary
expansion would imply that the funds rate could be lower than the
alternative A path by next summer, while still achieving the same
growth in the aggregates over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.
However, if the expected downward drift in money demand does not occur,
higher interest rates than indicated by either Federal funds path would
be required to achieve the desired growth in the aggregates.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative
B, alternative A"
1979-07-11,19,"(19) Virtually all of the expected slowing in M-2 in July-
August, relative to May-June, reflects the more modest growth of M-1.
Growth of the interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to remain
strong, accounted for mainly by continued sizable bank issuance of
MMCs. Inflows of funds to banks through MMCs are expected to remain
large, since the staff is projecting that the 6-month bill rate under
alternative II will remain near or above 9 percent and thus that no
significant differential will emerge in ceiling rates on these instru-
ments favoring thrift institutions. As in other recent months, large-
denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute to growth
in M-2 as banks continue to supplement their demand and small denomination
time deposits growth with Eurodollars and RPs.

","Alternative B, Alternative B"
1979-11-20,19,"(19) Provision of reserves needed to attain the specifications
for the monetary aggregates presented under alternative A would appear
to involve an easing in money market conditions. The growth in the
monetary base and total reserves over November and December implied by
that alternative--at 7¾ and 7½ percent, annual rates, respectively--are
only slightly more rapid than under alternative B. However, growth in
nonborrowed reserves, at over a 20 percent annual rate, would be con-
siderably more rapid. Such growth is consistent with an initial decline
in the funds rate to around 12 percent and a drop in member bank borrowing
to around $1 billion or so, given the prevailing 12 percent discount rate.
The funds rate range proposed for this alternative is 10½ to 15½ percent,
involving a reduction in the lower limit as compared with alternative B.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative B"
1980-02-04,19,"(19) Alternative A would call for a more rapid increase in money
targets for the current and next quarter, implying a step-up in M-1A growth
from January to March to about a 5½ percent rate, with more rapid expansion
in the second quarter. The monetary base and total reserves over the next
two months might be expected to grow at annual rates of 6 and 1 percent
respectively under such a policy. This somewhat greater reserve supply
would tend to be associated with some downward pressure on money market
rates, with the federal funds rate possibly declining to the 13 percent
area over the next few weeks. With an unchanged discount rate, the lower
funds rate might be consistent with member bank borrowing of around
$1 billion. On that assumption nonborrowed reserves would expand at
about a 2 percent annual rate over the last two months of the current
","Alternative A"
1980-04-22,19,"(19) To achieve alternative A targets, total reserves might have
to expand at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the March to June period. Assuming
member bank borrowings of around $1 billion in the next few weeks, and
gradually declining over the quarter to $1 to $1¼ billion, nonborrowed
reserves would rise by a 22½ percent annual rate. Such growth of
reserves probably would be associated with a fairly substantial drop in the
federal funds rate in the intermeeting period, perhaps into the lower half
of the 12 to 19 percent range suggested for this alternative.
","alternative A"
1980-07-09,19,"(19) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under
alternative B, total reserves would have to expand at about an 8¼ percent
annual rate from June to September. Assuming a level of member bank
borrowings (excluding special borrowings) of about $50 to $100 million,
nonborrowed reserves would expand at about an 8 percent.annual rate.
","alternative B"
1980-12-18,19,"(19) To attain the somewhat higher monetary targets of alterna-
tive A total reserves would have to increase at a 2¾ percent, at an annual
rate, between November and March and by a 3½ percent rate in the two-month
December-January period. The federal funds rate may fall to around 16
percent in the intermeeting period, and, given the present discount rate
structure, borrowing could be in a range around $1 billion. Other
short-term rates may drop 3 percentage points or so, tending to
lessen the financing and cash flow difficulties of many businesses
and households. The reduction in deposit costs at thrift institutions,
while substantial, would still leave them facing severe earnings pressures
over the next several months. Even though short rates drop more under
this alternative than under alternative B, long rates may be little
different, particularly if inflationary expectations remain high--as they
may if a substantial easing in short rates occur well before signs of a
weakening in price pressures or before there are clear signs of a significant
drop-off in economic activity.
","alternative B"
1982-02-01,19,"(19) Alternative C, which calls for growth of M1 at about a
in total reserves over the balance of the quarter at about a 2 percent
annual rate. Assuming a decline in adjustment borrowing from recent levels
to about $1 billion, nonborrowed reserves would rise at 2 percent rate.
A federal funds rate of about 13 percent would be implied. The 3-month
bill rate would likely decline from present levels to around 12 percent
or a bit lower as expectations of further monetary ease tend to develop.
Bond yields may edge down from current levels, inducing a pick-up in bond
issuance from recent depressed levels.

","alternative A, alternative B"
1983-03-28,19,"(19) Given below are two alternative drafts for the operational
paragraph of the directive. The first retains the general approach adopted
at the February meeting, but with the language updated to take account of
developments since that time, with M3 now apparently just above the upper
limit of its long-run range, and M2 starting just above its range. The
second is proposed in the event the Committee decides to return to specifi-
cation of numerical objectives for the monetary aggregates. This alternative
also includes language in brackets that might be considered, depending
on how or whether the Committee wishes to condition the Desk's response
to incoming data on the aggregates.
Alternative I - Existing Language
For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain
the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions. Lesser re-
straint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of
growth in the monetary aggregates [DEL: to or below] RELATIVE TO the paths
implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions
relating to the introduction of new accounts. The Chairman may call
for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic
Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve
paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be
associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range
of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.
Alternative II - Language Incorporating Numerical Objectives for Second
In the short run, the Committee seeks restraint on reserves
consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3
to annual rates of about ____ and ____ percent respectively. The
Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of about
____ percent would be consistent with its objectives for the broader
aggregates. [The Committee agreed that somewhat faster monetary
growth would be tolerated if it appeared to be associated with
continuing distortions from growth of the new deposit accounts or
unusual demands for liquidity.] [Lesser restraint on reserves would
be acceptable in the context of a more pronounced slowing in the
growth of the aggregates.] The Chairman may call for Committee
consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations
that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths
during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated
with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ to
____ percent.
","alternative
a"
1983-05-24,19,"(19) The approach of alternative A, particularly if it also
involved a cut in the discount rate, could lead to fairly sizable declines
in short-term interest rates, partly because it would tend to confirm that
the Committee was discounting the recent behavior of M1. A 3-month bill
rate around 7½-7¾ percent might be anticipated, and the prime loan rate
should come down another notch. A moderate decline in long-term rates is
also probable. There is a possibility, though, of some adverse effect on
long-run inflation expectations, given the recent strong economic and
monetary data--which would have a negative impact on bond markets. In
foreign exchange markets, a drop in short rates here would help reverse
the rise in the dollar of recent days, but it is doubtful that the dollar
would drop very substantially, given the continuing attractiveness of
dollar assets and the probability of some easing action by foreign central
","alternative A"
1983-08-23,19,"(19) Under alternative C, M2 and M3 growth over the June-to-
September period might be somewhat below objectives specified at the
last Committee meeting, though M1 growth may be close to its 7 per cent
third-quarter objective. However, should the higher interest rates cause
sizable shifts of saving funds out of NOW accounts into instruments bear-
ing market-related interest rates, M1 growth could slow substantially
in September and also into the fourth quarter. Growth in M2 and M3
would also tend to slow, though perhaps not as markedly as M1, in the
fourth quarter. The probable dampening effect of these higher interest
rates on growth in money and income as the year progresses suggests the
likelihood that attaining longer-run money and credit targets for 1984
would involve a substantial easing of interest rates later this year or
early next year from the alternative C levels.
Directive Language
Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the directive,
with the numerical specifications adopted at the meeting on July 12-13 shown
in strike-through form.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
The Committee seeks in the short run to (increase slightly further
MAINTAIN/DECREASED SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of reserve restraint. The
action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates
of about [DEL: 8-1/2] ____ and 8 ____ per cent respectively from June to September,
consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year.
Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other
factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesser restraint
would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of
the aggregates from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint
would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Committee
anticipates that a deceleration in M1 growth to an annual rate of around
[DEL: 7] ____ per cent from June to September will be consistent with its third-
quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total
domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the ranges established for
the year. The Chairman may call for Comittee consultation if it appears
to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives
and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely
to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of
[DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ per cent.
","alternative C, alternative C"
1983-11-14,19,"(19) Somewhat tighter reserve conditions are contemplated under
alternative C, with discount window borrowing in the neighborhood of $800
to $900 million and the federal funds rate rising to around 10 percent.
Under these conditions, growth in M1 and M2 for 1983 would be expected to
move down further in the lower halves of their respective longer-term
ranges, while M3 would come in closer to the midpoint of its range.
Market interest rates would rise sharply from current levels under this
alternative. Such a tightening over the period immediately ahead does
not appear to be widely anticipated in the market despite the recent
strength of the economy, given growth of the monetary aggregates well
within their ranges and concerns generated by international debt problems.
The 3-month Treasury bill rate would probably move up in a 9-1/4 to 9-3/4
percent range, and bond yields would probably adjust similarly, at least
initially. The recent decline on yields in fixed-rate mortgages would
probably be reversed, and the dollar would appreciate further in foreign
exchange markets.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1983-12-19,19,"(19) Borrowing at the discount window would be expected to aver-
age around $650 million under alternative B, with federal funds continuing
to trade in a 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent range, probably nearer the upper end
(and possibly a little higher around year-end). With the renewed expansion
of transactions deposits, total reserves would be expected to increase at
about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate through March, and nonborrowed reserves
would rise at a 4-1/2 percent rate.
","alternative B"
1984-01-30,19,"(19) The less rapid growth of money under alternative C, though
still leaving the aggregates well within the alternative II longer-run
range by March, would also be consistent with the slower annual growth
rates of longer-run alternative I. The November-to-March growth rates
of 7-1/2 and 6 percent for M2 and M1, respectively, contemplated by this
alternative would bring these aggregates to levels just above the mid-
points of the alternative I ranges by March. Such growth rates would
probably entail somewhat greater restraint on reserve positions over the
weeks ahead, with borrowing rising to the neighborhood of $1 billion.
Nonborrowed reserves might contract slightly over the next two months.
","alternative C"
1984-03-26,19,"(19) Proposed language for the operational paragraphs of the
directive, with alternatives, is shown below. Two variants for the
first sentence are given. The first variant is based on the present
directive and presents alternative language with regard to instructions
concerning the degree of pressure on reserve positions--whether to ""main-
tain"", ""increase somewhat"", or simply ""increase"". Alternative A would be
consistent with language to ""maintain"" the existing degree of reserve
restraint (interpreted as borrowing averaging over time on the order of
$650 million). Alternatives B and C would be consistent with language
""to increase somewhat"" or ""to increase"" reserve restraint, respectively.
Variant II differs from the first by focusing on the degree
of pressure on reserve positions that has recently emerged. Maintenance
of such pressure could be construed as consistent with the approach of
alternative B or an approach between A and B.

","Alternative A, alternative B"
1984-07-16,19,"(20) Expansion in the aggregates as specified in alternative B
would probably entail growth of nonborrowed reserves at about an 8 percent
annual rate from June to September, with borrowing continuing to average
around $1 billion. If recent experience is any guide, the federal funds
rate would probably average in the 11 to 11-1/4 percent area. However,
should investors gain more confidence in banks, and should bank attitudes
toward reserve management and the discount window become less cautious, the
funds rate could well trade consistently below 11 percent for S1 billion
in borrowing. If that occurred, it might entail greater expansion over
time in nonborrowed reserves--as banks more willingly lend and add to
deposits-and hence more money growth than assumed for this alternative.
","alternative B"
1985-02-12,19,"(19) The specifications of alternative B are expected to in-
volve reserve conditions consistent with borrowing at the discount window
remaining around $300 million. With borrowing remaining a little above
its frictional level, federal funds should trade in the neighborhood
of 8-1/4 percent. Nonborrowed and total reserves would increase at

1985-07-09,19,"(19) Alternative B contemplates a slowing of M1 growth to a
with seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window at around
the $350 million level used in constructing reserve paths since the last
FOMC meeting. Federal funds would generally trade in a 7-1/2 to 7-3/4
percent area. Growth in total and nonborrowed reserves would slow to 3-1/2
and 5-1/2 percent annual rates respectively over the June-to-September
period as the expansion of transaction deposits moderates.
","Alternative B"
1986-02-11,19,"(19) A pickup in M2 growth is expected under alternative B in
February and March, after its sluggish performance in January, as RP behavior
ceases to be a drag and core deposits advance more in line with income.
Nonetheless, M2 in March would remain somewhat below the lower bound of its
tentative growth cone for 1986. Growth in M3 over the remainder of the
quarter is expected to slow a bit from its January pace as bank credit expan-
sion moderates. M3 in March would be somewhat above the lower end of its
tentative range for this year.

sures remain unchanged, would average 8 percent at an annual rate over the
next three months. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount
window would continue around $300 million and federal funds trading would
stay in an area around 6-7/8 percent. Demand deposit expansion would be
expected slow markedly, as the effects of lower interest rates on growth in
corporate compensating balances and of heavy refinancing activity begin
to ebb. Even if depository institutions do not reduce NOW account offering

rates further, inflows to other checkable deposits should tail off toward
more normal levels as adjustments to the current structure of interest
rates and opportunity costs wind down. M1 growth on a quarterly average
basis, though, would drop only to 11-1/2 percent in the third quarter
under alternative B, owing to the arithmetic carryover effect of the
rapid buildup of cash balances in recent months. Such an increase in M1,
given the 4-3/4 percent growth in nominal GNP projected in the third
quarter, implies a decline in M1 velocity somewhat in excess of 6 percent--
about the same as the average pace over the past year and a half.

this alternative would be expected to slow substantially in February and
March from the average pace of recent months, but to expand at an 8 percent
rate over November to March, compared with the current short-run specification
of 7 percent. The year-end distortions seem to have unwound by February, and
growth over the balance of the quarter should reflect underlying influences
from income and interest rates. The increase in transactions balances is
expected to moderate substantially and smaller inflows to overnight RPs and
Eurodollars are likely following their recent surge. Nontransactions core
deposits should continue to outpace the growth of income as opportunity costs
remain quite low, especially on savings accounts, given the stickiness of
offering rates. The decline in M2 velocity is expected to moderate from

for monetary growth from June to September, along with associated federal

quarter base of the long-run ranges to September, are shown on the table
and charts on the following pages.) Under all three alternatives, growth
in M2 and M3 would strengthen from the pace of recent months, and M3 growth
from the fourth quarter of last year would rise noticeably into its annual
range. Under A and B, the pickup in M2 would be sufficient to lift this
aggregate to around the lower end of the alternative II long-run range by
September, although it would remain below its alternative I long-run range.
Under alternative C, the pickup in M2 growth would be inadequate to raise
this aggregate to near the lower end of even the alternative II long-run
range by September. M1, in all three cases, is expected to expand more
slowly than the broader measures over the next few months, at a pace below
that of the first half of the year.

1987-11-03,19,"(19), policy may well have to be implemented with greater flexibility
than under less uncertain conditions. One additional source of uncertainty
is the relationship between a given borrowing assumption and the associated
pressures in money markets. An increased reluctance by depository institu-
tions to be seen at the discount window would lead to more vigorous bidding
for funds in the market and higher federal funds rates for any particular
borrowing level. In the discussion, the staff has assumed that the return
to less turbulent conditions will be consistent with no more than a slight
drawing back from the discount window. If market conditions remain un-
settled or depository institutions are concerned about perceptions of their
safety and soundness, the assumed borrowing levels would be associated with
higher federal funds rates; alternatively in such conditions, the federal
funds and money market rates discussed under each alternative would require,
at least temporarily, somewhat lower borrowing objectives. With markets
particularly sensitive to incoming information, shifting expectations about
the course of monetary policy could also affect the federal funds rate for
a time. In these circumstances the borrowing-funds rate relationships given
in paragraph (11) are subject to considerable uncertainties.
(11) Alternative B would maintain the easier reserve conditions
that have come to prevail recently; the assumption for adjustment and sea-
sonal borrowing would remain at $450 million, with federal funds trading
expected to center at 7 percent or a bit below. Additional easing would be
sought under alternative A, either through a further reduction in the bor-
rowing assumption to $250 million or a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate;
the funds rate would be likely to fall to, or a little below, the 6-1/2
percent area. Alternative C would involve some slight firming of reserve
conditions, with borrowing being increased to $550 million and the funds
rate probably moving back to around 7-1/4 percent.
(12) The table below presents outcomes for money growth from
September to December that might be expected to accompany each of these
alternatives.1/ The margin of uncertainty surrounding these point estimates
is considerably larger than usual. The extent to which heightened liquidity
preferences together with substantial variations in the volumes of financial
transactions could affect future demands for the monetary aggregates is
difficult to gauge at present. How quickly money markets and depositories
will re-establish a more normal structure of short-term market and deposit
interest rates--and therefore the movement of opportunity costs--under each
alternative also is hard to assess.

(13) Under alternative B, persistence of the federal funds rate
near 7 percent implies that a substantial rise of Treasury bill rates would
accompany a partial restoration of normal interest rate relationships. As
exceptional demands for short-term Treasuries unwind, the 3-month bill rate
could move from the current 5-1/4 percent level to perhaps around 6 percent,
while private rates might rise relatively little. Even with a rate backup,
short-term rates would be 1/2 to 1 full percentage point below their aver-
age levels prior to the stock market crash. As a consequence, opportunity
costs of liquid deposits would still be appreciably below early fall peaks.
Interest rate incentives could thus begin to reinforce the impact of any

added liquidity preference in bolstering inflows to the liquid deposit and
money market fund components of the aggregates. At the same time, however,
a return toward more normal volumes of financial transactions would tend to
depress demand deposits from recently elevated levels. Under these condi-
tions, M2 might expand from September to December at around a 6 percent
annual rate. This outcome would bring M2 growth for the year to 4-1/2 per-
cent, compared with its 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent long-run range. Growth of
its M1 component would be expected to slow substantially following its
October bulge, with growth at 8 percent over the September to December
period and about 7 percent for the year.
(14) M3 growth over the fourth quarter at around 7 percent is
expected under alternative B, bringing growth for the year to 5-3/4 per-
cent, just within its annual range. Bank and thrift assets are expected
to grow at a moderate pace. The recent bulge in security loans at banks
is likely to be at least partly reversed; business loans might be fairly
strong, however, despite somewhat greater issuance of investment-grade
bonds, as inventory accumulation boosts financing needs and planned funding
with junk bonds of loans for leveraged buyouts is postponed. Overall, the
debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at around an
from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987.
(15) Under the reserve market conditions of alternative B, most
bond yields might edge higher as the increased preference for fixed-income
securities subsides and the possibility of further near-term monetary ease
is seen as diminishing. However, market concerns about potential softness
in economic activity and the associated scaling back of inflation expecta-
tions could keep long-term rates below their levels at the time of the last
FOMC meeting. Downward pressures on the value of the dollar in foreign ex-
change markets could continue as market attention focuses on U.S. external
imbalances, and would be accentuated by any perceptions that foreign mone-
tary authorities were unwilling to adopt more expansionary policies. If
dollar weakness occurred in the context of subdued growth in the U.S. econ-
omy and, particularly around the time of the Treasury's midquarter refunding,
of continued foreign participation in U.S. securities markets, bond prices
might be little affected. But if pressures on the dollar are accentuated
by disappointing progress in federal deficit reduction or if U.S. economic
activity remains robust, an inverse relationship between the dollar and
bond yields could reemerge.
(16) Under alternative A, the further easing of the funds rate
could help allay investor concerns about immediate financial strains. Other
private rates in money markets would slip off further, although the 3-month
bill rate might rise into the 5-1/2 percent area. Precautionary demands for
liquid monetary assets might unwind more rapidly under this alternative.
But the sharply narrower spreads of market over deposit rates would seem
likely to encourage large inflows into liquid accounts. Growth in OCDs
would be especially affected, with expansion in M1 likely to average 9 per-
cent over September to December. M2 would be expected to increase at a
picked up noticeably from September when inflows had been damped by pre-
vious increases in interest rates.
(17) Under alternative A, long-term bond yields would likely
continue to decline as market perceptions of impending weakness in the
economy tended to work against a revival of inflation concerns. However,
should the dollar fall precipitously on foreign exchange markets or the
further easing of policy be seen at some point as imparting substantial
strength to the outlook for the economy or prices, any drop in long-term
yields might be quite limited. While downward pressure on the dollar
could well intensify under this alternative, foreign central banks might
be more likely to ease monetary policies as the outlook for their export
industries weakens further.
(18) Alternative C calls for a slight firming of reserve pres-
sures, indexed by an increase in borrowing of only $100 million, and a rise
in the federal funds rate to 7-1/4 percent. The small increase in reserve
pressures under this alternative would better guard against substantial
further weakness in the exchange value of the dollar, but would leave bor-
rowing and the federal funds rate a bit below levels prior to the stock
market crash. Even so, the choice of alternative C before any dollar
decline were generally linked with renewed inflation concerns would risk
further disquieting domestic financial markets. A downward movement of
prices in private credit and equity markets would be likely, although if
the tightening were seen as contributing to economic weakness or damping
any incipient inflation, the rally in the Treasury bond market could be
extended. The 3-month Treasury bill rate could move into the 6-1/2 per-
cent area, with private short-term rates also rising appreciably. Growth
in the aggregates under alternative C would be retarded a little over the
rest of the quarter by the renewed upward movement in opportunity costs
on monetary assets. M2 growth would be expected to be around a 5-3/4
percent rate over September to December, though its M1 component still
would register growth around 7-1/2 percent given its October bulge. Both
aggregates would be entering the new year on fairly slow underlying growth
paths. The restraining effect on M3 would be muted as business credit
demands shifted more to banks and other short-term sources in response to
less attractive long-term financing.
Directive language
(19) Draft language for the operational paragraph is shown
below, with two variants proposed for Committee consideration. Variant I
takes account explicitly in several ways of the possible need to continue
to implement policy with special flexibility over the coming intermeeting
period, given unusual uncertainties about conditions in financial markets
and the economy. It also addresses the potential for exceptional demands
for liquidity.
Variant II follows the language of the current directive much
more closely, with relatively minor modifications to take account of
heightened market and economic uncertainties. This variant is shown with
proposed changes and additions in the usual strike-through and capitalized
In keeping with the asymmetric specifications in the bluebook,
alternative A calls for decreasing ""somewhat"" and alternative C for increas-
ing ""slightly"" the degree of pressure on reserve positions.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
Variant I
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,
the Committee seeks to [decrease somewhat (Alt. A)] [maintain (Alt. B)]
[increase slightly (Alt.C)] the existing degree of pressure on reserves
positions; the Committee anticipates that this approach to operations
will prove consistent with its desire to ensure the provision of
adequate liquidity in the present economic and financial environment.
The Committee recognizes that the volatile conditions in financial
markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may call for a special
degree of flexibility in open market operations. Somewhat/slightly lesser
reserve restraint would/might, or somewhat/slightly greater reserve
restraint would/might, be acceptable depending on conditions in financial
markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflation-
ary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the
behavior of the monetary aggregates. The outlook for monetary growth
over the months ahead is subject to unusual uncertainty. The contemplated
reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3
over the period from September through December at annual rates of around
____ percent and around ____ percent, respectively, but more rapid growth is
possible should preferences for liquidity be particularly strong. Over
the same period, growth in M1 is expected to be well above its average
pace in the previous several months. The Committee anticipates that
relatively frequent consultations might have to be called by the Chairman
over the coming intermeeting period, particularly if unsettled market
conditions imply the need for unusual flexibility in the implementation
of policy. The Chairman may also call for Committee consultation if it
appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions
during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated
with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____to ____ per-
Variant II
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,
the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/
INCREASE SLIGHTLY (Alt. C) the EXISTING degree of pressure on reserve
positions [DEL: sought in recent weeks]. Somewhat (slightly) greater reserve
restraint or somewhat (slightly) lesser reserve restraint would (might)
be acceptable depending on CONDITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, indications
of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, develop-
ments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the MONETARY
aggregates. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2
and M3 over the period from [DEL: August] SEPTEMBER through December at annual
rates of around [DEL: 4] ____ percent and around [DEL: 6] ____ percent, respectively. OVER
THE SAME PERIOD, GROWTH IN M1 is expected to [DEL: continue to grow relatively
slowly] BE WELL ABOVE ITS AVERAGE PACE OF THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL MONTHS. The
Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager
for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before
the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate
persistently outside a range of [DEL: 5 to 9] ___ to ___ percent.

1988-02-09,19,"(19) Although some easing of reserve conditions is now thought by
market participants to be in train or at least in prospect, the reserve
specifications of alternative A embody a larger move by the Federal Reserve
than has been anticipated in market rates. The downward movement of rates
associated with this alternative might be especially large if it were
accomplished through open market operations, since the resultant narrow
spread of the funds rate over the discount rate could foster expectations
that a further easing through a discount rate cut was imminent. The easier
conditions of alternative A are likely to put considerable downward pressure
on the dollar, though the extent to which this would show through in dollar
declines over the near-term would be affected by the incoming trade data.
The response of bond yields to an easing of policies and possible drop in
the dollar would depend importantly on perceptions of the situation in the
economy at the time. If economic conditions were thought to be quite soft--
weaker than consistent with the staff forecast--and incoming price data
suggested no more inflationary pressures, the drop in the dollar would be
less likely to adversely affect the bond market, which could register
further substantial gains.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1988-06-29,19,"(19) Under alternative B, the widening of opportunity costs over the
spring would continue to exert a restraining influence on M2 and M1 in the
months ahead. Growth in M2 would be expected to average 5-1/2 percent over
the June-to-September period. Growth of the more liquid components should
be most subdued, reflecting very sluggish adjustment of their offering
rates, while small time deposits, whose rates adjust rather promptly, would

strengthen a bit following their recent lull. In reflection of this
pattern, M1 would slow to only a 3-1/2 percent pace under this alternative.
","alternative B"
1989-02-07,19,"(20) The two near-term policy alternatives presented involve
adjustment plus seasonal discount borrowing of $600 million for alterna-
tive B with funds trading at around 9 percent or a bit above, and borrow-
ing of $800 million for alternative C with funds 1/2 percentage point
higher. The funds rate that is likely to be associated with a particular
borrowing level and with the current 6-1/2 percent discount rate clearly
has become harder to predict in light of the substantial downward shift in
the borrowing relationship that started around mid-October of last year.
Additional near-term uncertainties can be identified. If the beginning-
of-year reluctance to borrow extends well into February or turns out to be
a more fundamental shift, adhering to a given borrowing objective would be
associated with somewhat higher federal funds rates. However, some tem-
porary downward pressure on the funds rate relative to staff expectations
might accompany the sizable boost to free reserves projected in coming
weeks from market factors, as currency and required reserves decline sea-
sonally and the Treasury balance runs off. In addition, massive flows of
funds through the banking system in coming weeks, associated with payment
for the RJR-Nabisco takeover and the Treasury's midquarter refunding, may
contribute to temporary volatility in money market rates. In light of
these considerations, it may be appropriate for the Desk to continue to
view the borrowing assumption with some flexibility.
ending December 14 and 28 and in the most recent period ending January
25. Anticipations of System tightening and year-end pressures in
December and a usual beginning-of-year pullback in borrowing in January
likely enlarged those shortfalls. Thus, the expected relationship
assumes that only the average downward shift of approximately $400 mil-
lion since mid-October will prove permanent.
","alternative C"
1990-02-06,19,"(19) Alternative III would lower all the ranges from their tenta-
tive levels, and might be considered most consistent with strategy II
above, intended to make more certain progress in slowing inflation.
Although the tentative M2 range would allow for a substantially tighter
policy than assumed in the forecast, the 6-1/2 percent upper limit of the
M2 range of alternative III conveys an intention to respond promptly and
forcefully to any tendency for inflation pressures to intensify. The M2
range of this alternative also would tend to constrain any easing response
to a weaker economy, signalling a willingness to take risks on that side
to better assure a lessening of price pressures. The M3 and debt growth
ranges would be reduced by 1 percentage point to allow room for the slower
growth that might be associated with a tighter policy, given expectations
for sluggish growth in these measures under the staff forecast.
Short-run policy alternatives
","alternative a"
1992-06-30,19,"(19) Alternative I, the current 1992 ranges, might be chosen
if the Committee wished to temporize about its 1993 choice, given
velocity uncertainties. This alternative would seem a more plausible
choice should the Committee choose to maintain, rather than lower, the
again in 1993 could be appropriate if the Committee saw chances of less
robust velocity growth next year. This alternative also could be
communicated as connoting a willingness to take action to counter any
potential stalling out of the economic expansion; the 2-1/2 percent
lower end of this range is equal to the staff's projection, implying
that only a modest shortfall from this expectation would tend to prompt
an easing of policy. Particularly if the money demand shifts do not
persist, this alternative might be more consistent with efforts to
promote somewhat stronger growth in the economy than contained in the
staff forecast. In the staff forecast, M3 expansion would stay below
the lower end of the alternative I range as RTC and FDIC resolutions
pick up. The staff's projection for debt of domestic nonfinancial
sectors is below the midpoint of the alternative I range, but about
centered on the midpoint of the alternative II range.
Short-Run Policy Alternatives
","alternative a"
1995-11-15,19,"(19) below.
(9) The Greenbook forecast assumes no significant macro-
economic effects from any temporary disruptions incurred in the
process of determining the longer-run stance of fiscal policy. As
core consumer inflation staying at about 3 percent. Despite the lack
of a downward tilt to the inflation projection, the Committee still
might favor the unchanged stance of policy in alternative B if it
viewed the benefits of further disinflation as insufficient to justify
a more restrictive policy stance that pushed the economy below its
potential. The case for alternative B would be even stronger if the
Committee viewed the staff inflation forecast as too pessimistic--
either because spending would be weaker or because the price-output
relationship would be more favorable than the staff assessment.
Moreover, uncertainties about the economic outlook might seem par-
ticularly large, both because of the fiscal situation and because of
conflicting signals about spending and production. Such circumstances
could reinforce the desire to stand pat, awaiting clarification of the
(10) Earlier expectations of the possibility of easing at the
November FOMC meeting have largely been erased and, thus, the choice
of alternative B should have little impact on market interest rates.
The dollar would trade on foreign exchange markets around its current
level. Although market attention over the intermeeting period is
likely to remain focused on the budget deliberations, evidence of
persistent strength in private final demands along the lines of the
staff forecast might cause markets to begin to question their expecta-
tions about the path of interest rates going forward, and intermedi-
ate- and long-term rates could edge higher.
(11) The choice of easing under alternative A might be
favored if it were thought that some information about spending--for
example, soft industrial commodity prices and a sluggish manufacturing
sector or slowing growth of broad money and credit--was suggesting a
weakening in aggregate demand not yet evident in more general statis-
tics. These indicators might be signalling that real interest rates
already have been on the high side, and these rates could be rising
further, especially at the short end of the maturity spectrum, in
light of the recent decline in inflation and, most likely, inflation
expectations. In effect, the downward slope to the near-term yield
curve and narrow spread of the entire curve could be signalling that
real short-term rates are above those consistent with moderate growth,
especially in the face of impending fiscal restraint.
(12) The cut in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points
under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than now expected
in the market. Consequently, it would show through to other money
market interest rates, and banks would trim 1/2 percentage point off
the prime rate. The dollar would be expected to weaken on foreign
exchange markets as interest rates on dollar-denominated assets fell
in relation to those on other major currencies. The sustainability of
any decline in bond rates would depend on whether market participants
similarly saw the easing to be called for or rather viewed it to be
premature and unsustainable, as might become the case if indicators in
the period just ahead were broadly in line with the staff forecast.
(13) The choice of alternative C might be favored to the
extent that the Committee wished to have greater assurance that infla-
tion would continue to edge down. A more restrictive policy to
accomplish this objective might be seen as all the more needed in
light of recent strength in broad measures of output and labor input.
Furthermore, intermediate- and long-term interest rates have declined
substantially in recent months, potentially providing considerable
further impetus to spending.
(14) A move to tighten policy by 50 basis points as under
alternative C would especially surprise market participants, who con-
tinue to hold the view, supported by statements from some Committee
members, that the next policy move will be to ease. Money market
rates would rise by at least the 50 basis point increase in the fed-
eral funds rate. The dollar would tend to strengthen on foreign
exchange markets, and intermediate- and long-term interest rates would
retrace some of their recent declines as a higher path for real short-
term rates came to be built into market expectations.
(15) The table below presents expected growth of money and
debt under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. In
credit markets, supply conditions are expected to remain generally
favorable. However, the likely cutback in business lending by Japa-
nese banks and possible tendency for consumer lenders to become more
selective suggest that credit may become less freely available for
some borrowers. Nonetheless, borrowing by nonfederal sectors is
expected to firm a little from the subdued pace of recent months. For
businesses, strong cash flow and some slowing in the pace of inventory
accumulation will act to hold down financing needs, although this
effect will be offset by the scheduled completion of some large merg-
ers and associated share retirements in coming months. In the house-
hold sector, debt growth will be sustained in the near term in financ-
ing further healthy advances in durable goods outlays and fairly
robust housing activity. Total nonfederal debt is projected to expand
at below a 5 percent annual rate over late 1995 and early 1996. Fed-
eral borrowing will be light in the months immediately ahead, even
absent a spending lapse or debt-ceiling crisis, before strengthening
late in the winter. Taken together, total nonfinancial sector debt is
projected to grow 5-1/4 percent in 1995, around the middle of its
monitoring range, and to maintain that pace early in 1996.

(16) The broad monetary aggregates, especially M2, are
expected to strengthen after October. Moderate nominal income growth
and fairly narrow opportunity costs will tend to buoy expansion in
household demand for M2, helping to return growth in this aggregate to
the 4-1/2 percent area over the October-to-March period under alterna-
tive B. The rebound in M2 growth, combined with still-brisk issuance
of large time deposits to fund bank credit, would result in about
velocity would continue to decline over the fourth quarter of this
year and the first quarter of next year, albeit at a slower pace. The
velocity of M2, in contrast, should edge up over these two quarters,
reversing part of its unexpectedly large third-quarter decline. Mean-
while, M1 is projected to remain on a downward trajectory, owing to
the further spread of retail sweeps. For the year 1995, the staff
projects M2 to rise 4-1/4 percent, in the upper portion of its 1-to-5
percent range, and M3 to advance 6-1/2 percent, a little above its 2-
to-6 percent range. In March of 1996, both aggregates would be near
the upper ends of their tentative ranges for next year.
Contingencies Regarding a Treasury Default
(17) While a Treasury default on November 15 seems extremely
unlikely, given the financing flexibility apparently available to the
Secretary of the Treasury, the threat of default may linger for some
time. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the financial market conse-
quences of the inability of the U.S. Treasury to meet its obligations.
Payments on principal, interest, and a variety of other obligations
would be delayed for an unknown length of time, creating liquidity
strains for many banks and their customers. Strains could be com-
pounded by frictions in pricing, trading, and financing of matured
securities and overdue interest coupons. If trading conventions were
established to minimize those frictions, and if the Treasury could
clarify that interest would continue to accrue after maturity,
liquidity in the market for these instruments could be maintained to
some extent,.likely mitigating price changes. Nonetheless, with no
experience to guide judgments about these effects, sizable price
movements are conceivable--and, in any case, markets are likely to be
quite skittish. Treasury securities are the benchmark for pricing
many financial instruments and widely used as collateral, and, conse-
quently, the potential exists for spillover effects to other markets.
(18) Some of the uncertainties and skittishness could be
ameliorated by System and Treasury actions. In the payments area,
allowing matured securities to be transferred on the book-entry system
should foster secondary market trading, as would an announcement about
the procedures to be followed for delayed interest payments. More-
over, an announcement of the Desk's willingness to take defaulted
obligations as collateral in repurchase agreements should serve to
encourage that practice more generally. As to potential liquidity
problems, accepting defaulted Treasury obligations as good collateral
for discount window borrowing should aid those depositories, and
indirectly their customers, experiencing delays in receipt of pay-
ments. If liquidity problems seem to have the potential of becoming
severe or widespread, it may be necessary to consider steps to
encourage greater use of the discount window. Unpredictable demands
for adjustment credit, along with uncertainty about the total demand
for excess reserves in volatile markets, would complicate the
implementation of policy over this period, requiring considerable
flexibility in daily open market operations. If, despite these steps,
serious market disruptions threatened the health of the economy, the
FOMC might want to address the question of whether the System Open
Market Account should be used to purchase defaulted Treasury
obligations from the public, taking account of the Federal Reserve
Act's limitation that securities only be purchased in the open market.
Such a step, presumably, would be considered in the context of the
overall stance of policy in the circumstances.
(19) If market disruptions were limited, the effects on eco-
nomic activity of a Treasury default should be fairly small, with
little implication for the underlying stance of monetary policy. If
it looked as if significant reductions in the deficit would be forth-
coming, a run-up in Treasury yields might not be large and might not
be matched by increases in private rates. The Treasury would continue
to purchase goods and services and to take in tax receipts in accord-
ance with existing authority. A strong market reaction could present
policymakers with difficult choices. A generalized loss of confidence
and flight from dollar assets would tend to raise interest rates and
discourage spending, but it could also cause the dollar to drop

1996-07-02,19,"(19) Two policy alternatives are discussed below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would

tive C, would boost the funds rate to 5-1/2 percent, through either a
restrictive provision of nonborrowed reserves using open market opera-
","alternative B"
1997-02-04,19,"(19) If, on the other hand, the Committee did not see interest rates as likely to rise
much over the course of 1997 and saw nominal income as coming in close to the Greenbook
projection, and it wanted the ranges to encompass more comfortably the associated rates of
money growth, it probably would prefer alternative II, which would raise the ranges for both
M2 and M3 by 1 percentage point.14 (Alternative II would retain the provisional range for
debt.) Although money growth is forecast to be in the upper halves of the Alternative II
ranges rather than in the middle, the Committee might find this to be an attractive feature,
consistent with an opportunistic approach to disinflation and the Committee's current
asymmetric directive. Both imply the Committee has a stronger predilection to tighten
aggressively in response to overshoots in nominal spending than to ease in response to
unexpected undershoots. Hence, money growth is more likely to be well below than well
above the staff projection, consistent with the staff forecast lying in the upper halves of the
alternative II ranges. Furthermore, the higher upper limits of the ranges in this alternative as
compared with those of the provisional ranges imply greater scope for the possibility of
strong money growth associated with money demand shifts that are not related to disturbances
to spending, which would automatically be accommodated under current operating procedures,
and appropriately so.
Short-run Policy Alternatives
","alternative a"
1999-02-02,19,"(19) Even if the Committee agreed with the Greenbook analysis that inflation could
well move higher, it might choose to keep the intended funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as
in alternative B. The situation in global financial markets remains somewhat unsettled, and the
Committee may see that as posing a continued risk of further global contagion that ultimately
could jeopardize the U.S. expansion. Furthermore, with inflation quite low by many measures
and inflation expectations likely to be well contained, any price acceleration should be relatively
gradual. In these circumstances, refraining from tightening at this meeting still should leave the
Committee sufficient time to halt any uptrend in inflation before it gained substantial momentum.
Moreover, delay might buy time for the market to realize that a tightening of policy will be
necessary, reducing the odds on an outsized market reaction. Finally, the ongoing string of
favorable wage and price reports might suggest that, despite tight labor markets, inflation risks
are somewhat less than embodied in the staff forecast.
","alternative B"
2004-06-29,19,"(19) The Committee might be attracted to the unchanged policy stance of
Alternative A if it thinks that the recent increase in inflation owes largely to transient
factors and fears that the pace of economic growth might prove insufficient to work
down resource slack should policy begin to tighten at this time.  In the staff forecast,
which envisions tightening sometime soon, output remains a little below its potential
and the unemployment rate comes to rest ¼ percentage point above the staffs
estimated NAIRU in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The Committee might be concerned
that growth could fall short of even this projection, given the prospective shift in
fiscal policy toward restraint, the possibility that the current slowdown in
consumption growth could persist, and the risk that investment spending will not
accelerate to the degree necessary to offset slowing growth in household spending in
an environment of heightened geopolitical tensions.  The easier financial market
conditions that would accompany implementation of this alternative would tend to
support interest-sensitive spending, such as housing, consumer durables, and business
investment, and contribute to a stronger pace of economic growth, especially later this
year and during 2005.  Moreover, the simulations reported earlier could be interpreted
as implying that pursuing a somewhat stronger path for output might not involve
much cost in terms of higher inflation.  Indeed, the Committee might prefer to see
inflation in the future center around 2 percent, rather than 1½ percent as in the
baseline, in order to provide a significant inflation buffer against the zero bound to
nominal interest rates.
","Alternative A"
2005-02-01,19,"(19) A 50 basis point policy firming and an announcement like that indicated
under Alternative C would lead to a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and a
decline in bond and stock prices.  Market participants would likely mark up the
amount of cumulative tightening expected over the next year or so.  At the same time,
uncertainty about future policy moves might increase substantially, and market prices
probably would respond more forcefully to data releases and especially to news on
inflation.  The direction of the market moves would be the same, but the amounts

attenuated, if the Committee married a quarter-point rate firming with some of the
drafting language of Alternative C.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2005-05-03,19,"(19) The selection of the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate of
Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  That
hike, coupled with some or all of the changes in announcement wording discussed
in the previous paragraph, would prompt investors to revise sharply upward their
expectations for the path of monetary policy in the near term and likely beyond, and
thus would have a pronounced effect on financial markets more generally.  Interest
rates would rise substantially across the yield curve, equity prices would probably
decline, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could increase significantly.
The same language associated with a quarter-point increase in the funds rate would
also send markets in the same direction, but to a lesser extent.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2005-06-29,19,"(19) If the Committee, by contrast, has become more concerned about the
potential for an upcreep in inflation in response to developments over the
intermeeting period, then it may favor the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds
rate of Alternative C.  The staff forecast for inflation has been revised up since the
April Greenbook in response to data pointing to a narrower output gap, higher labor
costs, a narrower price markup, andmost importantlysubstantial further increases
in crude oil prices.  Indeed, far-futures oil prices, having risen even more steeply than
spot prices in recent months, currently suggest that significant relief from elevated
energy prices is unlikely.  The Committee may now see greater inflation risks than
does the staff or find the inflation outcome in the Greenbook to be unsatisfactory.  If
so, somewhat tighter money market conditions than assumed by the staff would seem
to be in order.  Indeed, the policy rules presented in Chart 8, especially those based on
an inflation target of 1½ percent, recommend substantial further tightening in coming
months.8  And, as indicated in Charts 5 and 6, the projection-based optimal control
exercises presented in the previous section suggest that, should the FOMC wish to
pursue an inflation rate of 1 percent, or to make more rapid progress in achieving a

resilience that spending and output have shown to date in the face of higher energy
prices, the Committee might wish to pick up the pace of tightening, especially if it
believes that the low level of long-term interest rates represents financial
accommodation that has to be offset.  The Committee may also see an advantage in

tightening policy in a relatively large, ½-percentage-point increment at this meeting if
it is worried that the measured tightening of policy to date, and especially the FOMCs
repeated indications that measured tightening can likely continue, may be fostering a
degree of complacency among investors about risksincluding the risks of investing
in housing.
","Alternative C"
2006-01-31,19,"(19) If members see sizable odds that the target funds rate has already been
raised sufficiently to check inflationary pressures, the Committee would presumably
choose to forego a policy move at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  With the real
funds rate now well within the range of estimates of its equilibrium, it might be
desirable to pause at this meeting before deciding whether to move to a position that
could entail policy restraint.  Given the lags in the effects of policy changes on the
economy and the already substantial cumulative increase in the target funds rate, the
Committee may prefer to await further data to assess whether additional tightening
steps would risk an undesirable overshooting.  Indeed, given the deceleration in
economic activity in the fourth quarter and the depressed level of longer-term interest
rates, members may believe that the staff forecast is too optimistic about the
prospects for continued solid growth.  Moreover, the possibility that the saving rate
might rise more rapidly toward historical norms, as discussed in an alternative
simulation in the Greenbook, may be of sufficient concern to the Committee that it
would require more evidence of inflationary pressures before firming policy further.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 27 of 42
In addition, if the Committee preferred that the core PCE inflation rate remain near
earlier would suggest no need to raise the funds rate above 4¼ percent this year.
","Alternative A"
2006-03-27,19,"(19) Some members preferences for the wording of the statement may not lie in
a single column in Table 1.  Elements of the table could be mixed and matched in
different ways, if the Committee wanted to convey a policy position to the public that
is somewhat less restrictive than currently built into financial markets but somewhat
less accommodative than Alternative A.  For one example, the Committee could
tighten a quarter-point as under Alternative B, but move its assessment of risks to
balanced as in row 4 of Alternative A, thereby signaling the likely end of the process
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 37
of tightening.  For another, the Committee could leave the funds rate unchanged, as
under Alternative A, but keep the risk assessment tilted toward the likelihood of
additional firming, as in Alternative B, which market participants would likely
interpret as indicating a probable pause in, rather than an end to, the tightening cycle.
The choice between these two alternatives rests mainly on the conviction with which
the outlook is held.  If members are fairly confident that one more firming step at this
meeting is sufficient to position the economy on a sustainable growth track with an
acceptable inflation rate, then they may want to declare a definitive end to the current
cycle of tightening, as in the firming with symmetric risks alternative.  If, instead,
members want to accumulate more information bearing on the outlook before acting,
and they also believe that such information is more likely than not to trigger future
policy tightening, then the alternative of no-action with asymmetric risks would find
some appeal.

2006-05-10,19,"(19) The likely reaction in financial markets, which could be sizable, to a 50 basis
point increase in the target for the federal funds rate might diminish the appeal of
Alternative C for the Committee.  But some of the rationale language of this
alternative could be used to stiffen the policy statement announcing a quarter-point
increase and thus make it more likely that financial markets would build in high odds
of a like-sized action in June.  For instance, the Committee could combine the
rationale paragraphs of Alternative C with the risk assessment of Alternative B.  To
make it more likely that market participants price in an additional move, the
Committee could strike the sentence characterizing additional firming as likely to be
modest in row 4 of Alternative B.  This might be favored if the Committee was
impressed by the resilience of aggregate demand in the face of the substantial increase
in energy prices and concerned that the momentum of spending could push the level
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 41
of output well above the economys potential.  Indeed, if the Committee harbored a
suspicion that economic slack had already been more than eliminated, it might see
increased inflation pressures as a palpable risk.  In that vein, members might read the
most recent figures on new and existing home sales as suggesting that the housing
market, while off its peak, is not cooling quickly enough to provide much assurance
that overall economic growth is in the process of slowing to potential.  In that regard,
the domestic boom alternative simulation in the Greenbook, which puts the funds
rate at 6¼ percent by year-end 2007, may strike some members as an uncomfortably
plausible outcome.
","Alternative C, alternative c, Alternative C, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2006-06-28,19,"(19) The announcement of Alternative C would lead market participants to
revise upward their outlook for the path for policy, and short- and intermediate-term
interest rates would rise as a result.  Longer-term interest rates could also rise,
especially if investors concluded that the FOMC was much more worried about
underlying inflation than previously thought.  Stock prices would fall substantially, and
the foreign exchange value of the dollar would increase.
","Alternative C"
2006-08-08,19,"(19) Under Alternative C, the paragraph on economic activity in the rationale
section could be identical to that proposed for Alternatives A and B.  The
announcement could then acknowledge the elevated readings on core inflation and
cite the potential for high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and
other commodities to sustain inflation pressures, but it could also point to the factors
likely to reduce inflation over coming quarters.  In the risk assessment sentence of the
announcement, the Committee could merely point to the dependence of future policy
adjustments on incoming information, as in the assessment proposed for
Alternative A.  Market participants would likely interpret such an announcement as
suggesting that the Committee no longer had a significant inclination to continue
firming policy.
","Alternative C, Alternative A"
2006-09-20,19,"(19) An announcement associated with Alternative C could, as in the August
statement, indicate that growth has moderated and, as in the other alternatives, drop
the word gradual in characterizing the cooling of the housing market.  The first
sentence in the inflation paragraph could also be similar to the one in the August
statement, but it might include the phrase on balance to acknowledge implicitly the
lower inflation figures published for July.  Rather than repeat the expectation that
inflation pressures would moderate, the Committee could state that it took the firming
action to foster a decline in inflation.  The Committee might also want to indicate
that, despite the firming step, it continued to be concerned with inflation risks, as it
was in August, and again reference the possibility of additional firming.  If, by
contrast, the Committee saw such a step as a final insurance move against inflation,
the risk assessment section could take a neutral position and simply indicate that
future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook,
thereby suggesting that the Committee no longer had a predisposition to firm policy.
","Alternative C"
2006-10-24,19,"(19) Money market futures and options indicate that investors remain confident
that the Committee will maintain the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent at this meeting.
Moreover, the Desks survey of primary dealers indicates that the accompanying
statement is expected to replicate broadly the September announcement.  The release
of a statement along the lines of alternative B, therefore, would not prove a surprise,
and the market reaction would likely be limited.
","alternative B"
2006-12-12,19,"(19) The firming of the stance of policy envisaged under Alternative C and the
accompanying statement would come as a considerable surprise to the markets.
Investors would likely revise up sharply their expectations for the path of policy over
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 40
the next year or so.  Short- and intermediate-term nominal and real yields would rise
markedly.  Longer-term nominal yields would likely rise by less or could even fall if
investors concluded that the FOMC had a lower objective for inflation than they had
previously thought.  With real rates higher, the foreign exchange value of the dollar
would likely rise, and equity prices would decline.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2007-01-30,19,"(19) The rationale portion of Alternative A reflects the improved readings on
economic growth but notes that the substantial cooling of the housing market remains
a drag on the expansion.  The paragraph on inflation observes that inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate over time, partly reflecting the recent decline in
energy prices.  To indicate the Committees overall assessment of balanced risks, the
statement then simply points to the dependence of future policy adjustments on the
evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by
incoming information.
","Alternative A"
2007-03-20,19,"(19) Although economic and financial news during the intermeeting period
increased the perceived probability of a cut in the funds rate later this year, market
participants continue to see no chance of easing at this meeting.  Market commentary
and surveys also suggest that participants would not be surprised if the statement were
to recognize downside risks to growth, but they see a lesser chance of a change in the
tilt in the assessment of risks.  Thus, pointing to a principal concern might be
read as a more forceful assertion than the wording in Januarys statement.  Dropping
the reference to additional firming from the risk assessment should convey more
balanced odds on the direction of future policy changes and thus weigh against that
reading.  On balance, the language for Alternative B seems likely to elicit little
reaction, but with markets apparently skittish, this judgment should be viewed as
more tentative than usual.
","Alternative B"
2007-05-09,19,"(19) In contrast, members might be concerned that inflation will not moderate
as the staff expects, and that the costs of inflation persisting at elevated levels for a
prolonged period could be substantial.  If so, the Committee might prefer to foster a
more decisive slowing in inflation by tightening 25 basis points at this meeting, as in
Alternative C.  Price pressures might not yet be viewed as convincingly on a
downward trend, and the softening in the dollar and increases in energy and other
commodity prices since the March meeting may have heightened the Committees
concerns about the inflation outlook.  Moreover, with the staff forecast suggesting
that the pace of moderation in core inflation might be even slower than previously
anticipated, members may perceive an increasing risk that long-run inflation
expectations might drift up, as illustrated by the Greenbook alternative scenario
Unanchored inflation expectations.
","Alternative C"
2007-06-27,19,"(19) Market participants do not expect a change in the funds rate at this meeting
and judging from the Desks survey of primary dealers, most expect only minor
modifications to the text of the accompanying statement.  The revisions to the
inflation paragraph under Alternative B would likely garner considerable attention.
Investors would not overlook the deletion of the somewhat elevated language and
would probably infer that the Committee believes that its prior expectation for
moderating core inflation is on track.  Particularly in light of the revisions to the risk
assessment, markets might also interpret the overall statement as signaling that the
Committee finds 2 percent to be an acceptable level of core inflation.  Market
participants would most likely mark down their expectations for the path of the
federal funds rate.  Equities would rally, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar
would depreciate.  Long-term bond yields might edge lower, but that fall could be
tempered, or even reversed, if the statement led investors to mark up their long-run
inflation expectations.
","Alternative B"
2007-08-07,19,"(19) The draft statement for Alternative B reiterates the view that the economy is
likely to continue expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  However, by
citing tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses, it also suggests
somewhat greater downside risk to growth.  The draft acknowledges recent favorable
readings on core inflation, characterizing them as relatively subdued.  At the same
time, it points to continued upside inflation risk by repeating language from the June
statement that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be
convincingly demonstrated and that the high level of resource utilization has the
potential to sustain those pressures.  Even if members judge that downside risks to
growth have increased in recent weeks and that upside risks to inflation have
diminished, they may still see the risks as unbalanced and thus want to indicate that
the Committees predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to
moderate as expected.  Taken as a whole, the language in Alternative B is slightly
softer than the June statement, but it also suggests that the Committee does not
expect the less accommodative conditions in credit markets to have a significant
adverse effect on the economic expansion.

markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become 
tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is 
ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a 
moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in 
employment and incomes and a robust global economy.
Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and 
increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going 
forward.
Rationale 
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months.
However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be 
convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization 
has the potential to sustain those pressures.
Assessment 
of Risk
In these circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has 
continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee 
judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably. The 
Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to 
mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in 
financial markets.

Committee would lower the target federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4¾ percent.
Alternative A would characterize the downside risks to growth as outweighing upside
risks to inflation, while Alternative B would not provide an assessment of the overall
balance of risks.  Under Alternative C, the policy rate would be lowered 25 basis
points to 5 percent, and the statement would indicate that the downside risks to
economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation.  Alternative D would leave
the target rate unchanged at 5¼ percent and report that the risks to growth and
inflation are roughly balanced.  As for the rationale portion of the statement,
Alternatives A, B, and C substantially modify the August 7 assessment of the outlook
for growth and of the risks around that outlook in light of credit and housing market
developments, using some of the wording from the August 17 statement.  In contrast,
Alternative D recognizes the deterioration in financial conditions but repeats the
judgment that moderate growth is likely over coming quarters.  Inflation readings
have continued to be benign but have not improved further over the past several
months.  Accordingly, under all four alternatives, the statement that inflation readings
have improved in recent months is changed to shift the time reference for the
improvement in inflation to this year.  In addition, under the first three alternatives,
the inflation assessment is modified to observe that some inflation risks remain and
that the Committee will monitor inflation developments carefully, but the reference
to pressures on resource utilization is deleted.  This may be appropriate if the
Committee is now a bit more confident that the continued favorable inflation
readings represent a permanent moderation in inflation and if it shares the staff view
of the degree of pressure in the labor market.  In Alternative D, the inflation
assessment is unchanged from the August 7 statement.  As usual, the Committee
could consider combining elements from more than one alternative.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2007-10-30,19,"(19) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to be
consistent with sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation over time
but sees appreciable downside risks to growth, it may wish to choose Alternative B.
The economy seems to have expanded at a brisk pace in the third quarter, boosted
primarily by personal consumption and business expenditures, suggesting
considerable underlying strength of spending prior to the recent financial turbulence.
In addition, strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance, partly
allaying concerns about a severe credit crunch.  The strong performance of the global
economy could also support U.S. economic growth.  And while the housing data
received during the intermeeting period were not encouraging, they also were not
greatly surprising, at least from the perspective of the September Greenbook forecast.
The real federal funds rate is now equal to its Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value
and just a bit above the range of model-based estimates (Chart 5), suggesting that the
current policy stance is likely to keep output in the vicinity of its potential.  In
addition, the present target for the federal funds rate remains close to near-term policy
prescriptions derived from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation target
(Chart 6) and is consistent with a number of policy rules, even assuming a 1½ percent
inflation objective (Chart 7).  However, the functioning of some financial markets is
still quite far from normal, credit conditions have tightened considerably for some
households and businesses since early in the year, and there is some possibility that
recent improvements in market functioning could be reversed.  The Committee may
be sufficiently concerned about a possible further deterioration in financial conditions
or about potential spillovers from the housing sector to believe that the risks to its
growth outlook are significantly skewed to the downside.  Moreover, it may see the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 23 of 44
possibility that a weakening of the economy could have a negative impact on financial
markets, leading to further tightening of credit conditions.  At the same time, the
Committee may believe that the inflation outlook is acceptable, although with some
upside risks.  Inflation data have been fairly benign in recent months, suggesting that
the underlying rate of inflation is relatively moderate, and the Committee may be
optimistic that recognition of its commitment to price stability will help gradually
reduce inflation over time.  But the high level of resource utilization, the recent
increases in energy and other commodity prices, and the decline in the foreign
exchange value of the dollar may be viewed as presenting upside risks to inflation.
Nonetheless, the Committee may believe that the downside risks to growth are the
greater policy concern.
","Alternative B"
2007-12-11,19,"(19)   Market participants appear to place about two-thirds odds on a 25 basis
point reduction in the target at this meeting, with most of the remaining probability
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 23 of 43
assigned to a 50 basis point move.  As a result, short-term interest rates would likely
rise modestly in response to Alternative B.  However, judging from the Desks survey
of dealers, the statement under Alternative B would likely be read as broadly
consistent with market expectations for additional policy easing.  Consequently,
longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar
probably would be little changed.
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-01-29,19,"(19) Alternative B would likely be seen by market participants as broadly
consistent with their current expectations for the funds rate, because a 50 basis point
easing of the target funds rate at this meeting appears to be their modal expectation
and because the risk assessment would probably be read as indicating a substantial
probability of further easing.  Since investors assign most of the remaining probability
to a smaller easing, the adoption of this alternative might cause a modest decrease in
interest rates, a rally in equity prices, and perhaps some depreciation of the foreign
exchange value of the dollar.

1971-02-09,20,"(20) Alternative C. As will be noted, this alternative is
similar to the second paragraph of the directive issued by the Committee
on December 15, 1970. It is suggested for possible use if the Committee
decides not to seek to make up past shortfalls in M1 even over the more
extended time period, if doing so would require the degree of easing in
money market conditions suggested by the analysis in paragraphs (9) and
(10) above.
""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote

The Committee may wish to have the proviso clause interpreted in terms
of the projections of M1 (or of M1, M2, and the bank credit proxy)
shown in the table on p. 13, based on the assumption of a continuation
of prevailing money market conditions. The proviso clause--like that
in the December directive--is formulated in a manner that would permit
growth in the aggregates at rates higher than projected, but would call
for easing of money market conditions to make up any shortfalls from
projections associated with this alternative.

for this alternative between now and the next meeting of the Committee, both
short- and long-term rates would likely rise very dramatically, and questions
would be raised about the prospects for continued growth in consumer-type
time and savings deposits under current interest rate ceilings. The current
discount rate would obviously be far out of line with the market conditions
associated with this policy alternative.
Possible directive language
","alternative b"
1971-07-27,20,"(20) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible use
if the Committee decides to hold to the course of continued orderly firming
of bank reserve and money market conditions, insofar as that might be
necessary to maintain downward pressure on the growth rates of the aggregates
and insofar as such firming proves to be feasible in light of the current
Treasury financing. As will be noted, the language is identical to that
adopted at the June 29 meeting except for the inclusion of the Treasury
financing, as a factor to be taken into account, along with developments
in capital markets.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
achieve more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over
the months ahead, taking account of THE CURRENT TREASURY
FINANCING AND OF developments in capital markets. System
open market operations until the next meeting of the

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
those objectives.""
If the Committee adopts this alternative it may wish to instruct the Manager
to seek to firm money market conditions within the ranges mentioned earlier
in connection with this alternative--including the proposed 5-1/2 to 6 per
cent range for the Federal funds rate--to the extent feasible in light of
the Treasury financing and capital market conditions. unless the monetary
aggregates appear to be increasing at rates well below those discussed
earlier under alternative B. On the other hand, the formulation of this
alternative--with its greater emphasis on monetary aggregates--would also
be consistent with the specifications of alternative A (or some modification
thereof) since a more moderate growth in M1 in particular is indicated in

1971-08-24,20,"(20) Total reserves for both August and September would be expected to
increase at around a 17.0 per cent annual rate of growth. In the fourth
quarter the rate of increase would be reduced to about half the August-
September rate. Nonborrowed reserves after declining sharply in July--re-
flecting the over $300 million increase in member bank borrowings--are
expected to track very closely to total reserves on the assumption that
borrowings will show no appreciable further increase on average in August.
In September, however, borrowings are projected to average sharply lower
than in August, so that nonborrowed reserves would have to increase at a very
rapid pace if targeted rates of growth in M1 and M2 are to be achieved. If
the decline in borrowings needed to achieve the alternative B paths is some-
what overstated, the growth in nonborrowed reserve could be commensurately

instruction to take account of both capital market and international
developments (as well as Treasury financing) for essentially the same
purposes as they serve in the current directive. In particular, the
reference to international developments can be interpreted as calling
for minimizing downward pressures on bill rates to the extent consistent
with the specifications for reserves and monetary aggregates and the
Federal funds rate constraint desired by the Committee.

1974-04-15,20,"(20) Presented below are three alternative formulations

cussed in the preceding section. For all three alternatives,
it is proposed to include a reference to Treasury financing because
the regular May refinancing will be announced on May 1.

bank reserve and money market conditions that would moderate
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1974-05-21,20,"(20) Under alternative A, banks are expected to continue
borrowing fairly heavily through CD's, and to obtain funds in the Euro-
dollar market. We have projected a slower growth in CD's, though, in
the expectation that tighter lending terms by banks will work to moderate
loan growth. Moreover, it appears that less-than-prime banks are be-
ginning to encounter investor resistance to their CD's. If, as seems
quite possible, such resistance intensifies, CD growth could be substantially
less than projected, bank credit expansion could be constrained, and
strains in other financial markets (including the Euro-dollar market) could
be exacerbated.
","alternative A"
1978-02-28,20,"(21) Alternative A involves a reduction in the Federal funds
rate over the intermeeting period to the 6-1/2 per cent mid-point of a
reversal of the early January rise in short-term interest rates. Long-
term rates, on the other hand, might not retrace all of their recent
increases if, as appears likely at the moment, market participants con-
cluded that the decline in short-term rates was likely to be temporary.
Meanwhile, the dollar would probably tend to soften in international
exchange markets.
","Alternative A"
1978-04-18,20,"(20) Alternative A calls for a reduction in the Federal
funds rate over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 6 to
in view of the increased rate of inflation and the probability that
the data to be published in coming weeks will be indicating more
rapid M-1 growth. Downward pressure on short-term rates would tend
to be moderate since participants would expect a reversal in the
funds rate over the near term. Thus, the 3-month bill rate might
still remain somewhat above 6 per cent, and private short-term rates
would decline only marginally. Long-term rates probably also would
be little affected. On the other hand, the dollar would almost
certainly decline in foreign exchange markets.
","Alternative A"
1978-07-18,20,"(20) Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal
funds rate to around the mid-point of a 7% to 8k per cent range by
mid-August. M-l growth would likely be in a 4 to 8 per cent
annual rate range over July-August and M-2 growth in a 6k to 10k
per cent range. Some additional upward pressure on short-term
interest rates in general likely would be associated with such an
upward adjustment in the Federal funds rate. With business loan
demands strong, the prime rate would likely rise further, and banks
and other lenders would be expected to continue to firm non-rate
terms of lending. The current level of borrowing from the Federal
Reserve discount window would probably increase back to the $14
billion area, intensifying pressures for another adjustment in the
discount rate. At the same time, the higher short-term rates would
tend to provide support for the dollar in international exchange
","Alternative C"
1978-10-17,20,"(20) Alternative II calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to around the mid-point of a 9 to 9½ per cent range during
the intermeeting period. This alternative appears particularly
appropriate if the Committee opts for the slower longer-run growth
in the aggregates encompassed by alternative C. It would also be
consistent with the longer-run policy stance indexed by alternative B,
as well as with near-term efforts to support the dollar in exchange
markets. The tightening of the funds market over the weeks ahead
envisaged by alternative II would--by introducing restraint earlier--
increase the likelihood that the funds rate would not have to rise
into the upper part of the 9 to 10¼ per cent range projected for next
year under alternative B.
","alternative a, alternative C, alternative B, alternative B"
1979-03-20,20,"(20) Alternative A involves a decline in the funds rate over the
intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9-1/4 to 10 per cent range.
Market rates would likely respond initially to this action by declining
from current levels. Thereafter, however, if the monetary aggregates
continue to rise as projected, and incoming data confirm the staff's
economic forecast, the decline of interest rates might begin to be
reversed. A decline in the funds rate would probably induce some downward
pressure on the international exchange value of the dollar.
","Alternative A"
1979-11-20,20,"(20) The approach to open market operations of alternative A
would exert considerably downward pressure on market interest rates generally
as more and more participants came to believe rates had peaked. This decline
of interest rates would ease cost pressures on banks and thrift institutions,
but would not, given present ceiling rates, substantially increase deposit
flows to thrifts, relative to alternative B, even if the funds rate began to
approach its 10½ percent alternative A lower limit.
","alternative A, alternative B, alternative A"
1980-01-08,20,"(20) The substantial decline in short rates that appear to
be implied by alternative A probably would be accompanied by significant
downward pressures on the international value of the dollar, especially
if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the
mid-East. Downward pressures would be strongest if market participants
come to expect a further decline in U.S. interest rates and interpret the
decline of interest rates as a sign that the Fed's resolve to combat
inflation has weakened.
","alternative A"
1980-02-04,20,"(20) The more rapid rate of growth in money of alternative A
would, as shown in the charts following page 13, cause aggregates growth
to rise by March to levels above the mid-point paths of alternative II;
by June the aggregates would be further above mid-point paths. Thus, if
monetary growth over 1980 is to be kept around the mid-point of the
alternative II range, reserve supply would have to be more restrained
in the second half of the year--with the federal funds rate probably rising
at a time when the economy is projected to be weakening even further.
","alternative A"
1980-04-22,20,"(20) Alternative A would be accompanied by further declines in
short-term market rates as market participants became more firmly convinced
that the System would not be putting a floor under interest rates. However,
questions may well be raised in markets about the consistency of a sharp
further drop in rates with last month's anti-inflation program, and these
concerns would tend to limit rate declines in longer-term markets. Nonethe-
less, conventional home mortgage rates would probably retrace a large part
of the sharp run-up of the last 60 days, as the further decline in short-term
rates strengthens thrift deposit inflows this quarter.
Directive language
","Alternative A"
1980-07-09,20,"(20) Alternative A, which is designed to hit the 4½ percent
path for M-1A by September, calls for a 10 percent rate of growth of
that aggregate from June to September, followed by a sharp slowing to 4½
percent in the September to December period. Reserve supplying operations
to achieve this target would call for growth in both total and nonborrowed
reserves at about a 10¼ percent annual rate in the next three months. It is
anticipated that money market rates would decline under this alternative
over the next few weeks, with the federal funds rate moving towards the 7
percent lower end of its proposed range and the 3-month bill rate moving
back into the 6 to 7 percent range. Such a decline in rates would bring
increased pressure on banks and thrift institutions to cut their lending
rates and would very likely cause a further erosion in the exchange value
of the dollar unless accompanied by drops in interest rates abroad. A
significant decline in short rates is likely to lead to some sympathetic
response in capital markets as well. However, the substantial volume of
oncoming issues from both the private and public sectors, as well as
investor concerns about inflation, would tend to limit declines in bond
yields. Staff projections suggest that short-term rates would have to
rise sharply by late summer or early fall to lower growth in the aggregates
if the midpoints of the longer-run targets for the year are to be achieved.
","Alternative A"
1980-12-18,20,"(20) Alternative C is the most restrictive of the three short-run
options presented. Under this alternative, M-1A in March would be just below
the lower end of the tentative long-run growth cone for 1981--on both an
adjusted and unadjusted basis. The alternative C monetary targets are
consistent with virtually no growth in total reserves. Borrowing over the
next few weeks might decline only a little from the recent $1.8 billion
level, and the federal funds rate might remain in the 18 to 20 percent area.
However, as the first quarter progresses, federal funds and other short-term
rates are likely to drop somewhat as evidence of economic weakness emerges and
demands for credit and money soften. Credit conditions on the whole would
remain quite taut, though. Mortgage markets in particular would show little
or no easing and this, together with continued consumer credit stringencies,
would inhibit household spending.
Directive language
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1981-07-06,20,"(20) With the funds rate in the 17 to 18 percent area, other
market rates would probably tend to decline from recent levels. However,
if the relatively rapid monthly money growth specified in this alternative
actually developed, the extent of any decline in other rates might be
limited by the expectational consequences of the rapid money growth. More-
over, interest rates will be influenced by relatively sizable credit
demands in the months ahead. The Treasury is expected to sell about
$15 billion, net, of marketable debt in the third quarter, and borrowing
will be much larger in the fourth. Business credit demands are expected
to expand, as internally generated funds do not keep pace with capital
","alternative
a"
1981-12-21,20,"(20) Alternative A calls for a 5-1/2 percent growth target for
M1 from the fourth quarter to March and 4-1/4 percent from the estimated
December level to March, and involves a greater risk that the level of M2
in the first quarter will be above the upper limit of its tentative
long-run range. This alternative would entail growth in total reserves at
a 4 percent annual rate over the first three months of the year. Assuming
a level of adjustment borrowing of around $250 million, nonborrowed
reserves would grow at a 6 percent rate. Such a pace of reserve provision
would likely be associated with a federal funds rate near or a little below
the current 12 percent discount rate. That probably would be accompanied
by a decline in short-term rates from recent levels, with the 3-month bill
perhaps around 10 to 10-1/2 percent. Bond yields are likely to decline some,
but declines might be limited by a sizable pickup in bond offerings as the
market viewed the decline as opening another ""window"". With an indication
of lower borrowing costs, thrift institutions would be somewhat more willing
to cut mortgage rates further and increase commitment activity.
","Alternative A"
1982-06-30,20,"(20) Alternative C sets the most restrictive monetary target,
with M1 growth during the third quarter specified at only 2½ percent.
It seems likely that the more restrained reserve provision consistent
with such growth would place further pressure on the money markets, with
the federal funds rate moving to 15 percent or a bit higher over the inter-
meeting periods. Borrowing at the discount window would rise to the vicinity
of $1½ billion, and nonborrowed reserves would drop at a 1½ percent annual
rate over the quarter.
","Alternative C"
1983-05-24,20,"(20) Over the longer run, looking toward the year as a whole,
alternative A would, with greater probability, involve M1 growth above
the FOMC's longer-run range, unless interest rates moved up again in the
second half of the year. M2 growth would be raised for the year, but the
direct effect of lower market rates on demand for M2 may be quite modest
given the relatively low interest-elasticity of that aggregate. Whether
M2 growth would be strongly affected, with some risk of overshooting the
present long-run range, would depend mainly on the degree of upward impact
on GNP growth (relative to our current forecast of 8 percent at an annual
rate over the second half) of some easing in interest rates now. Since
the contemplated interest rate declines are small,a substantial impact on
spending would seem to be contingent on whether the easing engendered a
significant improvement in business and consumer confidence.
","alternative A"
1983-07-12,20,"(20) Under alternative A, M1 growth is anticipated to slow much
more substantially than growth in the other aggregates. In large part,
this is because M1 demand is no longer expected to be buttressed by the
lagged impact of last year's sharp declines in interest rates. Indeed, the
recent rise in short-term rates should begin to have a restraining effect
on M1. The assumed M1 growth in this alternative would be consistent,
given our GNP projection, with about no change in its income velocity
in the third quarter,1/ in contrast to the declines in velocity that have
generally characterized the past several quarters. Such a turn-around
in velocity would not be unexpected during the course of a cyclical expan-
sion. However, as noted earlier, large uncertainties surround estimates
of M1 demand, given the change in its composition as NOW accounts have
become an increasingly important component of the aggregates. Should the
public continue to place a substantial amount of savings in components of
M1, and over the next few weeks some of the tax cut may well be lodged
in such deposits, the velocity of M1 could continue to fall--with M1
growth faster--at current levels of interest rates. On the other
hand, the large build-up in M1 balances of the past several quarters could
well support a rapid expansion in GNP without much further increase in M1
should confidence generated by continuing favorable economic news entail
a substantial reduction in demand for liquidity.
","alternative A"
1984-07-16,20,"(21) Interest rates generally might show little net change
under alternative B, though probably edging higher from the most recent
levels if funds traded consistently around 11-1/4 percent. Speculation
about a discount rate increase could become more widespread in markets,
and this could itself add to upward pressures, at least temporarily, on
federal funds and other rates. The dollar may well remain generally firm
on exchange markets.
","alternative B"
1985-07-09,20,"(20) In part, the slowing of M1 growth under alternative B is
expected to result from a substantial weakening in the demand deposit
component, working off a portion of its recent unusually large bulge.
The rapid growth of M1 late last quarter has brought money balances to a
point where they might be considered to be sufficiently high to finance
at least some significant GNP growth in the third quarter without further

expansion of M1. Indeed, if M1 remained at its June level during the
third quarter, average growth for the quarter would be more than 5-3/4
percent at an annual rate. While this suggests that transactions needs
of the third quarter may have been in some measure already satisfied, M1
growth over the months ahead is likely to be sustained by the continuing
effect on money demand of the recent declines of interest rates, if for no
other reason. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would be expected to
increase at around a 10 percent annual rate, implying another appreciable
decline in velocity of more than 3-3/4 percent at an annual rate given
the Greenbook GNP forecast.
","alternative B"
1986-02-11,20,"(20) With current reserve pressures unchanged as assumed in alter-
native B, the 3-month Treasury bill rate would trade around 7-1/4 percent,
the yield area reached following release of January's employment figures.
Bond yields, too, would be likely to fluctuate around very recent levels,
though still sensitive to incoming news about oil prices or the strength
of economic activity. Underlying demand pressures on credit markets are
expected to show little net change this quarter. A sharp drop in the growth
of domestic nonfinancial debt is in train, but most of the slowing represents
cessation of unusual borrowing activity late last year connected with the
special situation in the tax-exempt market. The recent pace of decline in
the exchange value of the dollar may not continue under alternative B,
though if the dollar is fundamentally tending downward, a significant rise
in the exchange rate is unlikely.
","alternative B"
1986-07-08,20,"(20) M2 growth under alternative B would slow further from
June, remaining close to the midpoint of its longer-run range through
September. Within the nontransactions component of M2, a moderation of
inflows to liquid retail deposits and money fund shares is expected to
about offset reduced outflows from small time deposits. M3 would grow at
around its pace of both May and June under alternative B, also keeping it
close to the midpoint of its longer-run range. CD issuance at banks and
thrifts is expected to pick up in the face of slower core deposit growth
and some modest quickening in loan demand. Overall debt growth, however,
is likely to remain in line with the pace of recent months.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1987-02-10,20,"(20) M3 under alternative B also is expected to slow in February
and March from the average pace of recent months as credit demands on banks
decrease sharply from elevated year-end levels, reducing needs to issue man-
aged liabilities. Overall credit growth should moderate as well, with domestic
nonfinancial debt expected to grow at an 8 percent rate over the balance of
the quarter. From the fourth quarter through March, debt would have expanded
at a 10 percent annual rate, in the upper part of any of the long-run

positions, federal funds would be expected to trade in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4
percent range, perhaps more toward the lower end of the range, given the
current absence of market expectations of a near-term tightening of
policy. In these circumstances other short-term rates would be about
unchanged over the near term, although the three-month Treasury bill rate
could drift higher as the paydown of bills abates. The dollar might
remain around current levels for a time, but at some point considerable
downward pressure could well reemerge under the weight of continued out-
sized external deficits. In this event, longer-term rates would tend to
rise in reflection of heightened inflationary concerns and short-term
rates could also begin to firm in anticipation of some additional tighten-
ing of monetary policy.
","Alternative B"
1988-02-09,20,"(20) The tightening of conditions under alternative C would be
entirely unexpected, and probably would result in substantial increases in
both short- and, at least initially, long-term interest rates. Stock prices
could drop, perhaps sharply, if the higher rates were seen as contributing
to weakness in the economy as well as raising the rate at which future
earnings are discounted, and risk premiums could widen again. The effects
on long-term rates and markets might be muted over time, however, if this
policy initiative bolstered confidence in the future purchasing power of the
dollar, in circumstances in which inflation concerns had been aggravated by
strong downward pressure on the dollar or greater economic strength than now
generally anticipated.
","alternative C"
1988-06-29,20,"(20) M3, under alternative B, is expected to pick up a little over June
to September from the pace of recent months as outflows from money funds
abate with the stable interest rates assumed under this alternative. Credit
demands on banks and thrifts and their issuance of managed liabilities
should remain strong. Corporate merger activity is projected to decline
appreciably, but business credit demands are expected to slow only a bit,
remaining focused on bank loans and short-term paper, as external financing
needs rise further. Household borrowing should remain moderate, but
Treasury financing will strengthen in the coming months along with the
deficit, leading to a pickup in federal debt growth. Total nonfinancial
debt is expected to expand at around an 8 percent annual rate over the June-
to-September period, about in line with that of the second quarter, placing
this aggregate 8-1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1987 base.
","alternative B"
1990-02-06,20,"(20) Three short-run alternatives are given below for Committee
consideration. Alternative B involves federal funds continuing to trade
in the 8-1/4 percent vicinity, in association with adjustment plus sea-
sonal borrowing of $150 million. The 7-3/4 percent funds rate for al-
ternative A appears roughly consistent with $100 million of borrowing,
while the 8-3/4 percent funds rate of alternative C would be accompanied
by about $200 million of borrowing. The borrowing levels for all three
alternatives abstract from any special-situation adjustment borrowing by
the Bank of New England, but incorporate an upward technical adjustment of
$25 million in part to take account of the initial stages of the typical
upswing in seasonal borrowing from January lows. Further adjustments
likely will need to be made later in the intereeting period as seasonal
borrowing continues to rise. Under alternative B, adjustment credit may
average only $75 million, not far above the frictional amount, as the
reluctance of depositories to tap the window for such credit is rein-
forced by questions about the general health of the banking industry that
are raised by developments in the real estate and LBO lending areas and by
the problems of the Bank of New England. The Desk would be expected to
continue to exercise flexibility in its approach to the borrowing assump-
","Alternative B, alternative C, alternative B"
1991-02-05,20,"(20) Two near-term policy alternatives are presented below for
Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds trading would
be expected to average around 6-1/4 percent, with the assumption for ad-
justment plus seasonal borrowing remaining at $100 million. Under alter-
native A, the funds rate would decline to the area of 5-3/4 percent.
Alternative A could be implemented by a reduction of the borrowing assump-
tion of $25 million to $75 million.8  Such an approach, while technically
feasible, would place the funds rate below the discount rate and the low
levels of borrowing could add marginally to funds rate volatility. An
alternative approach to achieving the money market conditions of alterna-
tive A would be through another half-point cut in the discount rate com-
bined with maintenance of the borrowing assumption at $100 million. Bor-
rowing has been running somewhat higher, partly as difficulties in adapt-
ing to lower reserve requirements more often necessitated use of the
discount window on non-settlement days to avoid overdrafts. Some of these
difficulties will be alleviated as required reserve balances rise sea-
sonally and banks opt for higher required clearing balances. Still, the
Desk will have to take account of the possibility that demands for excess
reserves could continue to be high and variable. At least for a time,
such demands are likely to continue to be rather unpredictable day to day,
implying more frequent spikes in borrowing and volatility in the federal
funds rate.
","alternative B, Alternative A, alternative a"
1992-06-30,20,"(20) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented below
for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, the federal funds
rate would continue to center on 3-3/4 percent. Maintaining that un-
changed stance likely would entail retaining the assumption for adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing at its $225 million level. Under the
easier alternative A, the funds rate would be reduced to 3-1/4 percent,
placing it 1/4 percentage point below the discount rate, in association
with a borrowing assumption of $200 million. Or this same funds rate
could be achieved by keeping a $225 million borrowing assumption and
reducing the discount rate 1/2 percentage point to 3 percent. Under
alternative C, the funds rate would be raised to around 4-1/4 percent by
selecting a borrowing specification of $250 million. Further upward
technical adjustments to the borrowing assumption likely will be needed
over the intermeeting period with any of the alternatives to account for
a continued upswing in seasonal borrowing.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1992-11-17,20,"(20) Against a backdrop of public readings that suggested
some firming in economic activity, market participants would be sur-
prised by the 1/2 point decline in the funds rate under alternative A.
Most short-term interest rates would match the decrease in the federal
funds rate. Major commercial banks would take that cue, cutting the
prime rate 1/2 percentage point; even with a 5-1/2 percent prime rate,
banks still would enjoy a swollen margin over funding costs, at least in
comparison to the historical record. The foreign exchange value of the
dollar would decline. Long-term interest rates are likely to drop,
reversing much of the recent runup. Such a decline would be limited,
however, should the easing engender market fears that the lagged effects
of the monetary stimulus, reinforcing a boost provided by a prospective
fiscal policy package in 1993, would undercut the downward tilt to in-
","alternative A"
1993-02-02,20,"(20) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented for
consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, the allowance for
adjustment and seasonal borrowing would be retained at $50 million, in
association with trading in federal funds continuing to be centered
around 3 percent.6 Under alternative A, the federal funds rate
would drop to 2-1/2 percent; this could be achieved either through a
reduction in the borrowing allowance to $25 million or by a half per-
centage point cut in the discount rate with unchanged borrowing.
Federal funds would trade around 3-1/2 percent under alternative C in
combination with a $25 million boost to the borrowing allowance.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1997-02-04,20,"(20) Presented below are two short-run monetary policy alternatives. Under
alternative B, the federal funds rate would kept at 5-1/4 percent. Under alternative C, the
federal funds rate would be raised by 1/2 percentage point to 5-3/4 percent, either through a
less generous provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1999-02-02,20,"(20) If, by contrast, the Committee saw increasing inflation as the primary threat to
sustained economic expansion, it might choose the 25 basis point hike in the funds rate of
alternative C at this meeting. The Committee might read the persistence of surprisingly strong
growth in aggregate demand, exceptionally high levels of resource utilization, and soaring equity
prices as evidence that real short-term interest rates are sufficiently below their equilibrium
values to justify prompt action. Although inflation picks up only gradually in the staff forecast,
deferring action could allow inflation pressures to build and necessitate a more pronounced
policy firming at a later date that would impose greater restraint on the real economy. Markets
have weathered both the year-end and, to date, the Brazilian crisis, suggesting that conditions
may be resilient enough to withstand a slight firming of U.S. policy. Indeed, to the extent that a
portion of the cumulative 3/4 percentage point ease last fall reflected the Committee's desire to
cushion the economy against potential financial market disruptions that have not materialized, it
might now be appropriate to take back some of that easing. The Committee might even be
concerned that inflation could accelerate more sharply than envisioned in the staff forecast,
perhaps because faster-than-projected economic growth would put greater pressure on labor
markets or because the staff had earlier underestimated the role of temporary factors in damping
inflation, so that when these factors turn around the underlying tautness of labor markets will
show through forcefully to wages and prices.
","alternative C"
2000-06-27,20,"(20) If the Committee is instead concerned that the odds of rising inflation are still
elevated, as in the staff forecast, a further firming of policy of 25 basis points at this meeting
could be warranted, as under alternative C. Indications of slower expansion are still
tentative, the level of resource utilization remains quite high, and some of the earlier financial
restraint has been unwound by the recent rally in bond and equity markets. In this
environment, the Committee may want more assurance that growth in aggregate demand will
not rebound than is provided by the likely additional effects of previous tightening actions.
The argument for tightening would be even more compelling if the Committee believed that
the growth of aggregate demand has to be restrained to substantially below the pace of
potential output for a while to lessen the intensity of resource use. Accelerating productivity
has held down the growth in unit labor costs, and thereby has helped to restrain inflation for
some time. However, its depressing effect on inflation may be running its course, as intense
competitive pressures in labor markets allow real compensation to catch up to the higher
level of productivity. If so, the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation would be
rising, even if productivity is continuing to accelerate.
","alternative C"
2004-06-29,20,"(20) As indicated in Table 1, the announcement accompanying a decision to
leave rates unchanged could note that although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated,
a portion of the increase in recent months presumably has been due to transitory factors.  The
Committee could retain its reference to the measured removal of policy
accommodation by indicating that With underlying inflation still relatively low and resource use
slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be
measured.  If the Committee were to select Alternative A, presumably it would also
retain the judgment it reached at the May meeting that the risks to both sustainable
growth and price stability are balanced.  Because market participants are virtually certain
of a tightening of policy at this meeting of 25 basis points, adoption of this alternative
would come as a considerable surprise and might trigger a sizable drop in short-term
interest rates, a sharp rally in bond and stock prices, and some depreciation in the
foreign exchange value of the dollarprovided that the Committees announcement
bolstered investors confidence that inflation was unlikely to be a problem.  These
market reactions could be considerably more adverse, however, if market participants
instead perceived that monetary policy was falling behind the curve.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative A"
2005-02-01,20,"(20) If the Committee wanted to pause in the process of removing policy
accommodation at this meeting, it might adopt Alternative A.  The Committee may
believe that more of the increases in productivity in recent years have been structural
than assumed by the staff, leaving the economy with more resource slack currently
and raising the odds of a lower inflation rate prospectively under the Greenbook
policy path.  In addition, members may foresee a continuation of labor market slack,
rather than the gradual elimination forecasted by the staff, because of continued
business caution, a faster return to the trend rate of labor force participation, or a
lower NAIRU.  The Committee may also harbor some suspicions about the resilience
of aggregate demand, perhaps on the thought that the saving rate could rise more
rapidly or the drag from net exports intensify more substantially than in the staff
","Alternative A"
2005-06-29,20,"(20) A number of modifications to the Committees statement would be required
to accommodate the selection of Alternative C.  For instance, the FOMC might wish
to delete the reference to robust underlying growth in productivity, given that actual
productivity growth appears to have dropped sharply in the second quarter.  Although
the staff believes that trend productivity continues to expand briskly, the Committee
might be sufficiently uncertain about that assessment to be uncomfortable continuing
to assert strength in underlying productivity.  As for aggregate demand, the
Committee could summarize recent developments by saying that Recent data suggest
that the underlying pace of spending growth remains solid despite elevated energy
pricesstriking the prior reference to the slowing of growth in the springand
could go on to mention that Labor market conditions continue to improve,
eliminating both apparently and gradually.  The FOMC could implicitly
acknowledge the further run-up in energy prices and reduction in labor market slack
by noting that Pressures on inflation have picked up further in recent months,
although measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.  As
discussed in the April Bluebook, the Committee might also take this opportunity to
eliminate the forward-looking language from the statement, dropping both the risk
assessment and the reference to the measured pace of tightening.
","Alternative C"
2006-01-31,20,"(20) The proposed wording of inflation concerns for Alternative A, in row 3 of
Table 1, is basically a reordering of the sentences employed in the last announcement.
The phrase regarding elevated energy prices and resource utilization is placed first to
leave readers with the sense that such concerns have been somewhat assuaged by
recent readings on core inflation and inflation expectations.  Even if members believe
that further tightening will likely be needed at some point, they may view those
sentiments to be adequately communicated by the asymmetric risk assessment under
Alterative A.
","Alternative A"
2006-05-10,20,"(20) In contrast, the Committee may believe that further policy tightening at this
meeting is not necessary or desirable and that, at least for now, maintaining the
current stance of policy is appropriate, as in Alternative A.  As noted previously, the
cumulative firming of policy to date has been significant, and the real federal funds
rate is now well within the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium value.  In
these circumstances, the Committee may wish to pause to obtain more information
that would be useful in assessing whether further action will be necessary.  Put
differently, policy accommodation now appears to have been eliminated, and, with
core inflation remaining containedand perhaps believed likely to edge lower over
timedespite sharp increases in energy and commodity prices, the Committee may
not feel a need to move from a roughly neutral posture to a restrictive stance.  That is
the message of the simulation presented earlier:  If the equilibrium real rate is in the
neighborhood of 2¾ percent, a 2 percent inflation goal could be achieved by holding
the nominal funds rate at 4¾ percent.  Indeed, estimated monetary policy rules imply
that the existing stance of policy is about appropriate or even a little firmer than
would be predicted by past Committee behavior (Chart 8).  Model simulations using a
number of simple policy rules also suggest that further tightening may not be required
at this time (Chart 9).  And even if members believe that further tightening could

Policy Rule Charts: Explanatory Notes
For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staffs estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (t), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead (t+2|t and t+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
( *t ty y ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap ( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ + ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +   ), and the assumed value 
of policymakers long-run inflation objective ( * ).    
Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarters prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Finally, for the forecast-based rule and the first-difference rule, it should be noted that prescriptions near 
the end of the Greenbook horizon also depend on an extension of the Greenbook baseline forecast. 
  
Estimated Policy Rules:  Estimation is performed using real-time quarterly data taken from the 
Greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of each quarter.  The specific lag structure of the 
outcome-based rule is chosen according to the Bayesian information criterion over the sample period 
starting from 1988Q1.  The forecast-based rule differs from the outcome-based rule in that it also 
permits staff forecasts of inflation and the output gap to be among the explanatory variables.  
Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model, where the shocks are randomly drawn from the set of model equations residuals for the 
period 1986-2004.  The following table indicates the specification of each rule and its root mean squared 
error (RMSE) over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

eventually prove necessary to address upside risks to inflation, they may see no
urgency to implement such restraint.  Such an assessment might be importantly
influenced by members regional knowledge of the housing situation.  With national
data, particularly survey information, pointing to some cooling, the Committee may
put some weight on the housing slump alternative simulation in the Greenbook,
which suggests that if significant confidence effects accompany a drop in housing
values, then considerably easier monetary policy would be warranted.
","Alternative A"
2006-06-28,20,"(20) If, in contrast, the Committee is particularly concerned by the soft tone to
the incoming data on spending, it might feel that the best course of action at this
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 41
meeting would be to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in Alternative A.  With
news on spending and prices pointing in different directions, the Committee could
combine such a policy move with statement language implying that policy would likely
be on hold in the near term to await additional information, although policy firming
was likely at some point down the road.  Leaving policy unchanged at the current
meeting would be consistent with the prescriptions from a number of simple and
estimated policy rules (Charts 9 and 10).  Indeed, most of those rules call for an easier
policy than currently priced into financial markets, suggesting that the level of the
federal funds rate may have already been brought up enough to prevent an
unsustainable spurt in economic growth.  Staff estimates of equilibrium real interest
rates indicate that cumulative tightening to date has effectively removed policy
accommodation.  Given the lags in policy, the easing of pressures on resources
expected to result from this prior tightening, together with the anticipated flattening
out of energy prices, may be seen as likely to be sufficient to point inflation down
toward an acceptable range.  Moreover, the Committee may see significant downside
risk to the outlook if it views the recent marked declines of indicators of housing
activity as possible harbingers of a prolonged and sizable reduction in housing
construction and household spending along the lines of the housing slump
Greenbook scenario.
","Alternative A"
2006-08-08,20,"(20) With market participants placing less than fifty-fifty odds on a policy move
at this meeting, short-term interest rates would likely jump in response to
implementation of Alternative C.  However, the effect on intermediate-term interest
rates would be considerably more muted, and long-term rates could even decline a
little should the announcement persuade investors that inflation pressures were less
intense than they had appreciated or that the Committee was seeking a slightly lower
long-term rate of inflation than they had previously perceived.  Despite the rise in
short-term interest rates, with policy tightening evidently having drawn to a close,

equity prices might rally.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar might be little
","Alternative C"
2006-09-20,20,"(20) The tightening of policy and the statement shown under Alternative C of
Table 1 would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  Investors
would likely conclude that at least one more policy firming action was in store after
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 36
the action at this meeting.  Nominal money market rates and shorter-term coupon
yields would rise sharply.  Real rates further out the curve could also increase, but
nominal long-term yields could decline if market participants concluded that the
FOMC was seeking a steeper decline and had a lower ultimate objective for inflation
than they had previously perceived.  With real rates higher, the foreign exchange value
of the dollar would likely rise, and equity prices would probably decline.  However, if
the Committee instead opted to remove the reference to future firming and to suggest
that it saw the risks as balanced after the move, these market responses would likely
be muted considerably.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2007-01-30,20,"(20) Shorter-term interest rates would likely fall in response to an announcement
along the lines of Alternative A, and longer-term yields might follow suit.  However, if
investors read the statement as suggesting that the Committee was willing to tolerate
somewhat higher rates of inflation over the long haul, longer-term yields could be
pushed higher and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely weaken.
","Alternative A"
2007-03-20,20,"(20) In contrast to the fairly benign scenario described in the staff forecast, the
Committee might be concerned that widening disruptions in the subprime market
point to greater weakness in housing and that lower equity prices will slow the growth
of consumer spending.  The Committee also might see recent economic data as
indicating that weakness has spread from housing and motor vehicles to other goods-
producing sectors, perhaps along the lines of the weak investment alternative in the
Greenbook.  If so, members might prefer the quarter-point policy easing in
Alternative A.  This alternative offers an explicit judgment that risks to growth would
remain tilted to the downside even after this policy action, thereby conveying greater
concern about those risks than Alternative B.  At the same time, it would continue to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 41
point to upside risks to inflation.  Members who consider 2 percent inflation an
appropriate goal might note that most of the policy rules shown in Chart 7 point to a
reduction in the target funds rate in the second quarter.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2007-05-09,20,"(20) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the
Committees judgment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.
The Committees concern about the prospects for inflation could be stressed by
noting that considerable uncertainty surrounds the judgment that inflation is likely
to moderate.  The sources of upside risk to inflation could be broadened to include
reference to the recent increases in energy and other commodity prices.   The
statement could conclude by noting that, even after the policy tightening, the
Committees predominant concern remains the upside risks to inflation.
","Alternative C"
2007-08-07,20,"(20) Market participants see substantial odds of an easing of monetary policy in
coming months but little chance of a rate cut at this meeting.  In responding to the
Desks survey, most primary dealers said they expect no more than minor
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 43
modifications to the text of the accompanying statement, although one-third indicated
they expect the Committee to mention deteriorating financial conditions.  Alternative
B seems generally consistent with those expectations, so a sizable market reaction to a
statement such as that suggested in Alternative B appears unlikely.  But markets might
interpret the reference to tighter credit conditions for some households and
businesses as a first step toward a possible easing, in which case the perceived
probability of a rate cut in September would increase.
","Alternative
B, Alternative B"
2007-09-18,20,"(20) Financial conditions have deteriorated sharply on balance since the
August 7 FOMC meeting, making it more difficult and costly for households to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 49
obtain nonconforming mortgages and also leading to tighter credit conditions for
some firms.  In addition, some nonfinancial indicators, including the August
employment report, pending home sales, and anecdotal reports from contacts in
private industry, suggest a weaker near-term outlook.  In view of these developments,
the Committee may judge that prospects for economic activity have deteriorated
notably, and that the risk of a substantial and protracted slowdown in economic
growth is now unacceptably large.  With such an outlook, and with inflation data
continuing to be benign, members might see it as appropriate to counter the effect of
tighter financial conditions by easing policy by 50 basis points at this meeting, as in
Alternative B.  If members judge that evolving circumstances will likely warrant
easing policy by 50 basis points or more over the next several months, as in the staff
forecast, then they might think it prudent to implement a half-percentage-point cut at
this meeting.  The real federal funds rate is now about 50 basis points above its
Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value (Chart 5) and is also above the range of
model-based equilibrium estimates, suggesting that a half-point easing in policy is
unlikely to lead to unacceptable pressures on resources.  A 50 basis point rate cut is
also consistent with the prescriptions of a number of simple policy rules, even with a
also be viewed as valuable insurance against the risk of a further slide in investor and
consumer confidence or a possible further deterioration in financial market
conditions.  Should such fears ultimately prove to be unfounded, and financial
markets and the outlook for the economy improve, the Committee might believe that
it could act quickly to take back some or all of the easing.
","Alternative B"
2007-10-30,20,"(20) Given that the economy likely expanded at a pace noticeably above that of
potential in the third quarter, the draft statement for Alternative B describes recent
growth as solid.  It also takes note of the fact that strains in financial markets have
eased somewhat on balance.  While recognizing that the ongoing housing
deterioration will likely weigh substantially on economic performance over the next
few quarters, the statement points out that other sectors of the economy have proven
resilient so far and that the global economy remains strong.  The assessment of risk
paragraph would note that downside risks to growth are a greater policy concern to
the Committee than inflation risks and then repeats the second sentence of the risk
assessment from the September statement.
","Alternative B"
2007-12-11,20,"(20) If the Committee views the renewed deterioration in financial markets and
the sharper contraction in the housing sector as presenting a particularly severe threat
to the economic expansion, it might want to lower the target funds rate 50 basis
points, as in Alternative A.  A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate
would put the real funds rate close to the Greenbook-consistent measure of its
equilibrium value (Chart 5) and thus, under the baseline projection, would be
consistent with output returning to its potential in the medium term.  A reduction of
this size would also be broadly compatible with the optimal policy simulations with a
goal (Chart 7).  Moreover, given the deterioration in term funding markets and
increased concerns about balance sheet capacity and counterparty credit risk, the
Committee might worry about the potential for substantial additional tightening of
banks lending terms and standards, particularly if it viewed the arrangement of swap
lines with foreign central banks and implementation of a Term Auction Facility as
unlikely to provide significant relief to funding markets.  Members might also see
incoming evidence of a deepening contraction in the housing sector, as well as the
apparent softening in business and consumer spending, as presenting unacceptably
large downside risks to overall economic activity.  By contrast, incoming core inflation
data have continued to be moderate, and the Committee may see the inflation
outlook, and the associated risks, as essentially unchanged.  In these circumstances,
members might conclude that the weaker modal outlook for growth and significantly
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 43
increased downside risks warrant a 50 basis point policy move at this meeting.
Members may believe that the Committee would be able to reverse the easing quickly
if appropriate.
","Alternative A"
2008-01-29,20,"(20) If policymakers would prefer to move more aggressively to promote growth
and mitigate downside risks, then they might choose to reduce the funds rate target
by 75 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Even after the funds rate cut
on January 22, the real federal funds rate exceeds the Greenbook-consistent estimate
of short-run r* by about 60 basis points; thus, this degree of easing would be desirable
if policymakers share the staffs outlook but would prefer to bring the unemployment
rate back to the NAIRU more quickly than in that outlook, an approach that might
leave inflation close to 2 percent at the end of the decade.  Following the January 22
move with another aggressive easing at this meeting might also be attractive from a
risk management point of viewthat is, Committee members may see benefits in
moving more than they would perceive as needed merely to offset the weakening in
the modal outlook.  With the housing contraction steepening and financial stresses
continuing to intensify, policymakers may be particularly concerned about reducing
the likelihood of a nonlinear feedback cycle in which deteriorating macroeconomic
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 28 of 38
conditions generate further strains in financial markets and augment pressures on
banks balance sheets, further constricting the supply of credit and hence leading to a
fairly deep and long-lasting recession.  This policy approach might be particularly
appealing if members anticipated that the Committee would be equally flexible and
decisive in reversing the course of policy once downside risks to growth start to
waneas in the Prompt Reversal scenario in the box on Risk Management
Strategiesor upside risks to inflation start to loom larger.  Members might also
be attracted to this alternative if they believe that a larger easing move at this meeting
would diminish the probability that another rate cut would be needed over the
subsequent intermeeting period.
","Alternative A"
1971-03-09,21,"(21) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides to retain the structure of the present
directive--involving a primary instruction concerned with money market
conditions and long-term rates, and a proviso clause relating to the
""To implement this policy, System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted
with a view to maintaining prevailing money market conditions
while accommodating ANY [DEL: additional] downward movements in long-
term rates; provided that money market conditions shall [DEL: promptly]
be MODIFIED [DEL: eased somewhat further] if it appears that the
monetary AND CREDIT aggregates are DEVIATING SIGNIFICANTLY
FROM [DEL: falling short of] the growth paths [DEL: desired] EXPECTED.""
As will be noted, the primary instruction in alternative A is identical
to that of the present directive, except that it is proposed--in view of
the recent increases in long-term rates--to call for accommodating ""any""
rather than ""additional"" downward movements in such rates. Certain
changes are proposed in the proviso clause. These include: (a) making
it a two-way clause, on the assumption that, in light of the recent
stronger performance of the aggregates, the Committee would wish the
Desk to react to sizable deviations in either direction; and (b) referring
to ""credit"" as well as ""monetary"" aggregates, in order to explicitly include
the bank credit proxy among the aggregates to be considered by the Manager.
If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money
market conditions set forth in the first line of the table in paragraph (13)
above as a description of ""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the
proviso clause, to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in
connection with alternative A as the ""expected"" paths.
","Alternative A, alternative A, alternative A"
1972-08-15,21,"(21) In all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the
reference to the Treasury financing, now that it is completed. The
Committee has interpreted a reference to international developments in
other recent directives as calling for use of operating techniques designed
to minimize downward pressures on short-term interest rates. Retention of
this reference is proposed only in alternative A, since that is the only
policy course herein described under which there is believed to be any
significant possibility for short-term rate declines. It is proposed to
delete the reference to capital market developments in alternative A, since
generally stable long-term rates are foreseen under that alternative.
Retention of this reference in alternative B could be construed, as in
past directives, to call for the types of operations best calculated to
minimize upward pressure on long-term rates. In alternative C the same
language could be interpreted as calling for adopting Desk operations as
necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to the higher long-term
rate levels foreseen.

I -
","alternative B"
1974-05-21,21,"(21) Under alternative C and possibly also B, sharply higher
interest rates would erode asset values and bring the adequacy of bank
liquidity into question. Banks outside major money centers might in some
cases be excluded altogether from raising funds in national money markets.
With the intensification of pressures on financial institutions and
financial markets, many institutional lenders would likely severely
restrict loan extensions. The mortgage market would come under great
pressure and some nonfinancial businesses would encounter serious liquidity
","alternative C"
1978-02-28,21,"(22) The approach of alternative A appears most consistent
with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C.
Nevertheless, given the strength projected for economic activity, the
near-term decline in the funds rate under A would probably soon have to
be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent
with the mid-points of longer-run ranges for alternative A. The funds
rate would have to begin rising again in the second quarter and might
reach a high for the year of about 7-3/4 per cent by fall.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative A"
1978-04-18,21,"(21) Alternative A is consistent with a policy designed to
encourage more rapid growth in the aggregates over the longer-run.
However, given expected nominal GNP growth over the policy period,
the near-term decline in the funds rate would soon have to be
reversed to restrain growth in M-1 to the mid-point of its longer
run range. By late spring, the funds rate would have to begin
rising again, reaching 8 per cent by late in the year.
Directive language
","Alternative A"
1979-03-20,21,"(21) Over the QIV '78-QIV '79 period as a whole, the staff
still expects little net change in the Federal funds rate, given M-1
growth a shade above the middle of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ per cent
under alternative B and would, of course, more surely rise under
alternative C. But interest rates might tend to decline somewhat
in the latter half of the year, especially under alternative C, as the
rate of growth in nominal GNP decelerates further. Under alternative A,
however, we would expect interest rates to rise later in the year to
offset the stimulative effect on the aggregates of the easing in market
conditions assumed for the weeks ahead if M-1 growth over the year is to
be near the middle of the 1½ to 4½ per cent range. The projected
interest rate paths are shown in appendix I. All paths assume a down-
ward shift in money demand (in addition to ATS effects) on the order of
growth by a little less than 3 percentage points.
Directive language
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative C, alternative A"
1979-11-20,21,"(21) The monetary aggregates targeted over the last two months
of the year under alternative A would not lead to growth in the monetary
aggregates for the year 1979 very much different from that of alternative B,
but the lower interest rates associated with this alternative might tend to
moderate the expected recession in economic activity and tend to increase
the quantity of money demanded in early 1980. A reasonable implication
of this alternative, therefore, might be a policy in early 1980 that supplied
somewhat more reserves and money than consistent with the assumed 6 percent
midpoint of the Committee's longer-term target for 1980. Such a policy
early next year would, in turn, imply the need for more constraint on
money growth as the year progressed.
","alternative A, alternative B"
1980-02-04,21,"(21) Alternative C contemplates a reduction in money targets
for the current quarter to a 4 percent annual rate, as indexed by M-1A.
This would probably lead to some rise in the funds rate over the next
few weeks unless the economy weakens more than projected. Growth of the
monetary base would probably be at an annual rate of 5 percent, while
total reserves are likely to decline slightly. Initially assuming a level
of borrowing of about $1.5 billion, nonborrowed reserves would decline at
about a 6 percent annual rate over the January to March period. As shown
in the charts, alternative C implies that the money stock will be below
mid-point paths in March and further below them in June. Consequently,
in order to achieve longer-run targets, policy would have to be more
expansive in the second half of the year, leading to more substantial
downward pressures on short rates at that time than under alternative B.
","Alternative C, alternative C, alternative B"
1980-07-09,21,"(21) Alternative C contemplates a 6 percent rate of growth
in M-1A from June to September and continuation of that rate for the
balance of the year in order to achieve a 3 percent growth in that
aggregate from QIV '79 to QIV '80. Total reserves would have to expand
at a 6¼ percent rate. Assuming member bank adjustment borrowings of about
$200 million during the forthcoming intermeeting period-given the current
discount rate--nonborrowed reserves would increase at a 5¼ percent rate.
These reserve specifications suggest that the funds rate would increase
to around the midpoint of the 9 to 14 percent range suggested for this
alternative. And an even higher funds rate would be likely to emerge by the
fourth quarter. The policy stance of alternative C would intensify the
recent weakness in money and capital markets, and interest rates would be
expected to rise throughout the maturity spectrum. These interest rate
developments would probably lead to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign
exchange markets.
Directive language
","Alternative C, alternative C"
1981-07-06,21,"(21) Under alternative B, M1-B would grow at a rate that would
leave it below the lower end of the FOMC's 1981 range until November.
If this growth rate were continued through year-end, it would result
in growth for the year just marginally above the low end of the 3 to
higher interest rates would tend to hold M2 growth down. Growth of total
reserves of about 10½ percent, at an annual rate, from June to August,
would be consistent with the alternative B monetary target. Given the
present discount window structure, borrowing likely would run $2 billion
or a bit more.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1981-12-21,21,"(21) The contemplated modest decline in short-term interest
rates under alternative A might be accompanied by a tendency for the dollar
to decline on exchange markets. However, any decline could be short-lived,
or limited, as foreign central banks take advantage of any strengthening
in their currencies to lower their own interest rates further in light
of continued weak performance of their economies.
","alternative A"
1982-06-30,21,"(21) The firming in the funds market expected under alternative
C should be accompanied by moderately higher market rates generally but
with the likelihood that commercial paper and CD rates may rise more
rapidly than Treasury bill rates as concerns about spreading financial
problems are exacerbated. The 3-month bill rate may be in a 13 to 13½
percent range, and 3-month CD rates could move above 16 percent. Financial
pressures would inhibit the upturn in aggregate demand. The bank prime
rate likely would rise, as would primary mortgage rates. The dollar
probably would come under further substantial upward pressure in exchange

of 8 percent from the end of January. Actual growth is higher because
of continued, though diminishing,shifts into MMDAs.1/ M1 growth, which
has been quite substantial for several months now, is projected to decele-
rate markedly, partly as the lagged upward effects on growth of this
on a quarterly average basis would be around 8¾ percent, implying a slight
further drop in velocity in the first quarter of the year. M3 growth over
the February-March period is expected to expand about in line with its
December-January average.
","alternative B"
1983-05-24,21,"(21) Alternative C, which contemplates an increase in the federal
funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, would imply a level of adjustment
borrowing between $500 and $700 million at the current discount rate. With
an increasing amount of reserve demands met at the discount window, non-
borrowed reserves over the next month would decline at an annual rate of
around 2 percent. The 3-month bill rate would probably rise into the 8½
to 9 percent area, and the prime rate would come under upward pressure.
Bond rates, too, would rise, perhaps sharply initially, but subsequent
investor willingness to acquire long-term assets in light of improved
inflationary expectations would tend to blunt such increases.
","Alternative C"
1983-07-12,21,"(21) Given recent market rate adjustments, it would seem most
likely that interest rates would generally remain near current levels
under alternative A or decline some. In large degree, market rate increases
in recent days seem to have been in anticipation of a further tightening
of monetary policy. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might be in an 8¾ to
ceptionally sensitive, however, given the unexpected strength of the
economy, and the level of rates will be strongly influenced by assessment
of the meaning for monetary policy over the next few months of incoming
economic news and the Federal Reserve's decisions about longer-run targets.
If and as short-term interest rates tend to stabilize, long-term rates
may tend to decline from current levels.
","alternative A"
1984-01-30,21,"(21) The more rapid growth of money under alternative A would
bring M1 near the upper limit of, and M2 into the upper part of, their
respective alternative II longer-run ranges. In that sense alternative
A may be more consistent with the more expansive longer-run growth rates
of alternative III.
","alternative A, alternative
A"
1984-07-16,21,"(22) The degree of tightness in bank reserve positions under
this alternative would also work to restrain money and credit growth later
in the year. Thus, alternative B may be consistent with growth in M1 over
the year 1984 in the area of 6-1/2 percent with only a little further
upward movement of interest rates. Growth of M3 and credit for the year
would probably be somewhat above the upper limits of their current longer-
run ranges, though expanding somewhat more slowly in the second half than
in the first half of the year. Growth of M2 would be expected to be
around the midpoint of its long-run range.
","alternative B"
1985-02-12,21,"(21) Alternative A, which contemplates that M1 growth will
slow relatively little from the December-January average to around an
with long-run alternative I. Borrowing at the discount window might be
reduced to its frictional level--about $100-200 million at present.
However, a further reduction in the discount rate, or provision of above
average excess reserves through open market operations at least for a
while, may also be needed if the federal funds rate is to drop nearer to
the 7-1/2 percent area that seems more consistent with the reserve growth
needed to attain the money specifications of this alternative. Non-
borrowed reserves would be expected to grow at about a 20 percent
annual rate over the February-March period.
","Alternative A"
1985-07-09,21,"(21) Under alternative B, M1 by September would be about 10
percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter 1984 long-run target
base. It would of course be less high relative to a long-run target
rebased to QII '85, with growth from that base to September at an 8-1/2
percent annual rate. M1 expansion would be expected to slow further on a
month-by-month basis in the fourth quarter, to a 3 to 4 percent annual
rate, if reserve market conditions remain essentially unchanged, as the
effects on money demand of recent interest rate declines wear off and
velocity returns to around its expected trend rate of growth (absent
interest rate changes). As a result, M1 by the fourth quarter on average
might be about 8-3/4 percent above its QIV '84 level and 7 percent,
annual rate, above a QII '85 level.
","alternative B"
1986-02-11,21,"(21) Alternative A assumes a reduction in reserve pressures
associated with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window
lowered to around $150 million. Federal funds would probably trade around
the present 7-1/2 percent discount rate or a little less, and expectations
of a discount rate cut would probably revive. The 3-onth Treasury bill
rate would fall to around 6-3/4 percent or so, and long-term rates would
drop. Rates on large CDs might decline by even more if concerns about bank
asset quality--recently reinforced to a degree by the drop in oil prices--are
relieved a little by the general decline of interest rates. Also, bank CD
issuance would be more muted under this alternative by heavier inflows of
core deposits and some diversion of business credit demands away from banks
as long-term markets become more attractive. Additional downward pressure on
the dollar would emerge, with the extent depending in part on whether the
market comes to anticipate even further easing action--and particularly if
key foreign countries do not lower their interest rates.
","Alternative A, alternative b"
1986-07-08,21,"(21) The current market optimism regarding the likelihood of
a decline in the discount rate presumably would not be validated under
alternative B, and some edging up of rates from their most recent lows
could be expected, especially should economic activity begin to show signs
of the moderate strengthening as anticipated in the greenbook forecast.
The 3-month Treasury bill rate might well end the quarter closer to 6-1/4
percent than to its current quote of a little below 6 percent, and the
most recent level around 7-1/4 percent. Given the unusually wide spread
between Treasury and private long-term rates, the latter might increase
by somewhat less, especially if volume in bond and mortgage markets drops
off. Despite the slight firming of interest rates, the downward trend of
the dollar on foreign exchange markets is likely to persist in light of
the continued large external deficit.
","alternative B"
1987-02-10,21,"(21) The outlook for M1 growth continues to be highly uncertain
owing to both erratic demand deposit movements and the difficulty of assess-
ing the outlook for OCD growth at historically low opportunity costs. With
demand deposits already having retraced their run-up over year-end, this
component has begun to expand again. OCD growth is projected to moderate.
While this component accelerated in January, the opportunity cost of holding
NOW accounts has been widening since late summer, albeit slowly, and the
outflow of time deposits--one source of funds shifting to OCDs--is expected
to abate further. On balance, M1 growth would slow in February and March
under alternative B from the exceptional pace of recent months, although
continuing to outpace GNP by a substantial margin. In the first quarter, M1
velocity is projected to contract at about a 10 percent annual rate, after
falling at nearly a 14 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
","alternative B"
1988-02-09,21,"(21) The changes in reserve conditions under alternatives A and C
would have fairly small effects on money growth in the current quarter,
which has less than two months to run. Under alternative A, growth of the
aggregates would accelerate noticeably relative to the pace of the last two
months, leaving both M2 and M3 at or a little above the midpoints of their
tentative long-run ranges in March. The delayed effects of the declines in
interest rates contemplated under this alternative could push these
aggregates well into the upper halves of those ranges during the second
quarter, given the staff's GNP forecast. Thus, this alternative might be
considered most consistent with the higher paths for money growth envisioned
under long-run alternative I. Under the tighter reserve conditions of
alternative C, the broad aggregates would remain within the lower halves of
their tentative ranges through March. By reversing most of the interest
rate declines since October, Alternative C would tend to keep money growth
on a fairly slow path over coming months, dropping further below the
midpoint of the tentative ranges, and might be most consistent with the
growth rates in long-run alternative III.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative c, alternative C, Alternative C"
1988-06-29,21,"(21) The market does not appear to be anticipating an immediate further
monetary tightening as contemplated in alternative C. Thus, the half-point
increase in the funds rate under this alternative would prompt other private
short-term rates to move up by a similar amount. In view of still higher
funding costs, a boost in the prime rate of at least 1/2 percentage point
would seem much more likely. The Treasury bill rate would rise to 7 percent
or above. Such a firming in policy, at a time of market concern about
resource constraints and inflationary pressures, would tend to assuage some
inflation worries and any rise in bond rates could be quite small. Recent
firmness of the dollar could be sustained for a time unless foreign authori-
ties took this opportunity to tighten their policies substantially.
","alternative C"
1989-02-07,21,"(22) Short-term rates seem to have built in a further firming step
for policy in the near term. With funds continuing to trade at or a
little above 9 percent, as expected under alternative B, some of the rate
increases registered most recently may unwind, with Treasury bill rates
moving back to around 8-3/8 percent or a little below. Bond yields are
unlikely to move substantially, absent more indications of strength in the
economy or intensifying pressures on prices. As maintaining the reserve
pressures of alternative B causes international investors to begin recon-
sidering the likelihood of an imminent U.S. monetary policy tightening,
the value of the dollar could begin to slip.

1990-07-02,21,"(21) Three near-term alternatives for monetary policy are pre-
sented below for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal
funds would continue to trade around 8-1/4 percent in association with
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window starting out at
$450 million. Alternative A embodies an expected federal funds rate of
incorporates a funds rate of 8-3/4 percent and borrowing of $500 million.
With seasonal borrowing typically rising another $75 million to its peak
in August, increases in the borrowing specification likely would be needed
as the intermeeting period progresses to keep the borrowing allowance
consistent with the expected funds rate under each alternative.
","alternative B, Alternative A"
1991-02-05,21,"(21) Following the recent series of policy moves by the Federal
Reserve, market participants probably are not anticipating much if any
further easing in the near term. Consequently, maintenance of current
reserve market conditions under alternative B likely would have relatively
little impact on interest rates. The dollar would remain around the lower
levels reached recently, though subject to an unusual extent to political
and military developments. Over a more extended period, however, long-
term interest rates could back up a bit if information suggesting some
revitalization of the economy, as in the staff forecast, led market par-
ticipants to conclude that the easing of monetary policy had run its
course for the current business cycle.
","alternative B"
1992-02-04,21,"(21) Two short-run policy alternatives are presented below for
Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would con-
tinue to trade around 4 percent, with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing
averaging around $100 million.10 Under alternative A, the federal
funds rate would decline to the 3-1/2 percent area in association with a
reduction of the borrowing allowance to $50 million.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1992-06-30,21,"(21) Market participants appear to have built into interest
and exchange rates some probability of a near-term easing in the stance
of monetary policy next week after the FOMC meeting and release of June
employment data. Thus, in the near-term, rates would rise somewhat
under alternative B. Over the course of the third quarter, with infla-
tion pressures subdued and the pace of economic expansion moderate, as
in the staff forecast, short-term and long-term rates might come back
down. Long-term rates could well end up below current levels, espe-
cially if the lack of Federal Reserve action ultimately contributes to
downward adjustments to inflation expectations. The exchange value of
the dollar would probably average around current levels.
","alternative B"
1992-11-17,21,"(21) While the impetus to the monetary aggregates imparted by
choosing alternative A would be barely discernible in 1992, the lower
market interest rates embodied in that choice would push up both M2 and
M3 to the lower end of their current tentative ranges for 1993 by March.
The anticipated drop in nominal interest rates across the term structure
should speed balance-sheet adjustments, lowering debt service burdens
for households and corporations, and by reducing real rates as well,
provide some spur to spending.
Directive Language
","alternative A"
1993-02-02,21,"(21) The markets appear to have built in an unchanged policy
in the period just ahead and thus interest rates would be expected to
remain near current levels under alternative B. Longer-term rates
might come under a little downward pressure if, consistent with the
staff greenbook forecast, news on prices continues to be good, and
economic indicators point to a little less momentum in the economic
expansion than in the second half of last year. Intermediate- and
long-term rates are likely to be especially volatile as markets digest
reports and rumors of fiscal initiatives or shifts in debt management
policy by the new Administration, and as they assess how any initia-
tives might influence monetary policy. The upcoming mid-quarter
refunding announcement, scheduled for February 3, will be watched
closely by market participants for clues of the Administration's debt
management plans, and the general shape of the Administration's fiscal
policy plans are likely to be covered in the President's address to the
Congress on February 17. The dollar would fluctuate around current
levels under alternative B, moving up on any news of unexpected eco-
nomic weakness or policy easing abroad, or down should the news about
the U.S. economy prove to be softer than expected.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1996-07-02,21,"(21) A 1/4 percentage point increase in the federal funds
rate, as under alternative C, might be favored if the Committee wished
to impose greater restraint on spending to reduce the odds of a
gradual increase of inflation pressures. Prompt action would help to
counter the possibility of an impression developing, should data come
in on the strong side, that the Federal Reserve had become less will-
ing to act anticipatively to forestall a buildup of inflationary
pressures. A single 1/4 point tightening, however, would likely not
be adequate to contain inflation pressures if aggregate demand were
stronger than in the Greenbook or if the recent favorable behavior of
prices and costs were not to persist. Even in the staff forecast, a
single 1/4 point move probably is not sufficient to induce a downward
tilt to inflation. For example, the tighter alternative in the
Greenbook, in which policy is sufficiently restrictive to make
noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and beyond, assumes
that a quarter point tightening at this meeting would be followed by
considerable further firming later in the year.
","alternative C"
1998-02-03,21,"(21) The staff is projecting reasonably steady measured CPI inflation at around 2
percent over the second half of 1998 and in 1999, after increases of only about half that size
over the first half of this year. In this forecast, upward pressure on inflation associated with a
tight labor market is offset by downward pressures emanating importantly from the rise in the
dollar and decline in oil prices in 1997 and early 1998 and from declining capacity utilization.
The staff forecast is built on an unchanged federal funds rate, and if the Committee agrees
that this is both a reasonable and desirable outcome under those conditions, retaining the
current stance of policy under alternative B would be appropriate. Even if the Committee
suspects that the staff forecast has misjudged the likely economic situation, in the current
circumstances waiting for additional information might be seen as unlikely to have
significantly destabilizing effects on the economy. If, for example, the damping effects of the
Asian crisis turn out to be greater than is built into the forecast, since the economy still would
be operating beyond its sustainable potential for a while, the Committee should have enough
time to take appropriate countervailing action before the resulting economic weakness and
disinflation proceeds further or faster than the Committee would find desirable. On the other
hand, even if inflation pressures turn out to be more intense than the staff expects--perhaps
because persistent tightness in labor markets continues to boost the growth of compensation
increasingly beyond that of productivity--downward price pressures already in the pipeline
will still keep inflation quite low for a time. In these circumstances, the Committee should be
able to head off a potential upturn in inflation before higher actual inflation gets built into
wage and price decisions.
","alternative B"
1999-02-02,21,"(21) The 25 basis point easing contemplated in alternative A might be seen as
appropriate if the Committee remained concerned about the possibility that economic and
financial weakness abroad might prove deeper and more widespread than now expected. The
situation in Brazil is continuing to deteriorate, but the staff forecast builds in only limited
contagion to other emerging market economies. In Japan, the risks still may be seen as tilted to
the downside in view of the relatively high level of the yen, the backup in bond yields, and the
proximity of the nominal short-term interest rate to zero. In Europe, an ECB intent on building
its inflation-fighting credibility may be reluctant to counter a weakening economy by the easing
of monetary policy that is assumed in the staff forecast. Given these uncertainties, it is not
surprising that investors in international and domestic financial markets still appear to be quite
cautious about credit risk, suggesting the possibility of additional widening of spreads and
restraint on credit supply in response to unexpected adverse economic developments from
abroad. In these circumstances, a slight easing of the stance of monetary policy might be viewed
as a prudent measure to provide additional assurance that the expansion of domestic economic
activity will not weaken unduly should such events occur. In light of the slack conditions in
global economic activity, such an action would be unlikely to prompt a significant increase in
inflationary pressures for some time to come, even if the downside risks did not materialize.
","alternative A"
2000-06-27,21,"(21) Market participants would be surprised by the 25 basis point tightening of
alternative C. Short-term interest rates would rise immediately by almost 1/4 percentage
point. Especially if the Committee were to retain its existing statement about the balance of
risks, some increase in intermediate- and long-term yields also could be anticipated. The
dollar probably would firm some on foreign exchange markets, while stock prices likely
would decline. An announcement of balanced risks, by contrast, could well be taken by the
public as a signal that the Committee believes it may be finished tightening. Although the
rate hike would move forward in time the tightening that markets have essentially priced in, a
statement of balanced risks could prompt a rally in capital markets as market participants
mark down the odds they place on aggressive further tightening.
","alternative C"
2005-06-29,21,"(21) With nary a hint heretofore of an upshift in the pace of policy tightening,
market participants would be shocked by the combination of a 50-basis-point increase
in the funds rate at this meeting and the announcement suggested for Alternative C.
The statement would likely lead investors to conclude that the FOMC expected to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 26 of 42
continue to tighten policy for some timeand, with the elimination of the measured
pace language, to anticipate that at least some future policy moves could come in
additional 50-basis-point increments.  Such a revision to policy expectations would
likely trigger a sharp sell-off in fixed-income and equity markets and a rise in the
foreign-exchange value of the dollar, although the increase in long-term yields could
be limited should investors foresee that policy tightening might well lead to weakness
in the economy and subdued inflationary pressures.  The pairing of the language of
Alternative C with a 25-basis-point move would also catch investors unawares,
probably leading them to ratchet up their expectations of policy firming considerably
and prompting a sell-off in fixed-income markets.

2006-05-10,21,"(21) The rationale section of the Committees statement associated with
Alternative A could begin like that in Alternative B but soften the characterization of
the outlook for growth to likely to moderate to a sustainable pace.  It could use
essentially the same paragraph discussing inflation as that for Alternative B, but retain
the assertion that inflation expectations remain contained and emphasize the
expectation that core inflation will remain well contained.  The risk assessment
might be revised considerably from that employed at recent meetings.  In particular, it
could indicate that Against this backdrop, the Committee preferred to await
additional information about economic developments before taking any further
action.  The Committee sees the risks to its price stability objective as slightly to the
upside and judges it more likely that its next policy action will be a tightening rather
than an easing.  To accommodate those changes, the final sentence of the risk
assessment might be modified slightly to read In any event, the Committee will
respond to changes in the economic outlook, as implied by incoming information, as
needed to foster its objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2006-08-08,21,"(21) If members were dissatisfied with the gradual and limited reduction in
inflation in the staff forecast and favored a trajectory of policy that would foster a
steeper decline, they might wish to adopt the action and language of Alternative D.
The optimal policy path simulations of the FRB/US model (Chart 7) and the first-
difference rule (Chart 6), with a long-term inflation objective equal to 1½ percent,
would both call for additional firming of policy even following a 25 basis point
tightening at the August meeting.  The Committee may also find Alternative D
attractive if it deems the outlook for employment and growth to be more favorable
than the staff projection.  Moreover, members may be concerned that the staff has
underestimated the persistence of the forces that have boosted inflation, possible
consequences of which are illustrated by the persistent inflation alternative
Greenbook scenario.  Indeed, the optimal policy path suggested by a simulation of the
FRB/US model under perfect foresight in this scenario would call for considerable
additional policy firming in coming months.  However, the policy response would be
tempered in the more realistic circumstance that the persistence of the inflationary
forces became clear only gradually over time (see box on next page).  Even if the
Committee saw the staff inflation forecast as the most likely outcome, and one that
would be satisfactory, it might find this alternative appealing if it were persuaded by
recent price data that the upside risks to inflation, and the potential costs should these
risks be realized, continued to predominate despite an additional 25 basis points
increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  The potential for further increases
in energy prices, for example as a result of mounting geopolitical tensions, could be a
reason for such worries.
","alternative a"
2006-10-24,21,"(21)  In contrast, the Committee might now be more concerned about the
downside risks to growth, perhaps in part as a result of the sharp slowing estimated
for the third quarter.  If so, Alternative A might find some support.  In this
alternative, the stance of policy would be maintained at this meeting, and the
statement would indicate that the outlook was such that the Committee did not have a
clear view as to the likely future direction of policy.  The Committee might judge that
there is a material probability that growth could prove weaker than in the staff
forecast, perhaps reflecting a more pronounced housing market adjustment with more
extensive effects on the rest of the economy, along the lines of the Housing
correction with spillovers scenario described in the Greenbook.  Moreover, if the
Committee, like the staff, saw only sluggish near-term growth in activity and
employment, it might be concerned that any additional adverse shocks to demand
could have a disproportionate impact on the economy.  Maintaining the federal funds
rate at 5¼ percent for some time would be broadly consistent with the Committees
past behavior as captured in the estimated policy rules presented earlier.  Further, as
pursuit of a 2 percent inflation objective has the federal funds rate remaining near
current levels for the next year or so, before moving gradually lower thereafter.
","Alternative A"
2007-01-30,21,"(21) In contrast, the surprisingly strong economic performance in the fourth
quarter and continued tightness in labor markets might heighten the concern of some
members that the current stance of policy is likely to produce insufficient progress on
inflation.  If so, the Committee might judge that an additional 25 basis point increase
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 38
in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in Alternative C, is warranted.  Both the
optimal policy path simulations of the FRB/US model (Chart 6) and the first-
difference rule (Chart 7) suggest that additional firming of policy should be
undertaken if the Committee wishes to achieve a long-term inflation objective of
downside risk to the outlook appears to be less pressing.  In light of the economys
resilience over the past several quarters, the Committee may also be concerned that
the recent rebound in personal consumption expenditures may prove more persistent
than in the staff projection (as in the buoyant consumer spending alternative
Greenbook scenario), suggesting that the current stance of policy may not prevent the
economy from stretching its resource use tighter.  In these circumstances, and with
core inflation uncomfortably high, a slight policy firming at this meeting may be seen
as both appropriate to ensure that the modest improvement in core inflation in recent
months is not reversed and as desirable to signal the Committees resolve to foster a
further decline.
","Alternative C"
2007-03-20,21,"(21) The rationale for Alternative A points to sluggish business investment and
ongoing weakness in housing as likely to exert a drag on growth, thus supporting a
judgment that risks to growth remain tilted to the downside even after a quarter-
point rate cut.  By also pointing to remaining inflation risks and adopting a symmetric
characterization of possible future adjustments in the policy rate, the assessment of
risk in Alternative A is meant to convey that this policy action will not necessarily
commence a sequence of rate cuts.
","Alternative A, Alternative A"
2007-06-27,21,"(21) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the assessment
that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace while reordering the
clauses in order to underscore the view that the adjustment in the housing sector
appears unlikely to derail the economic expansion.  The inflation paragraph would de-
emphasize the recent monthly price data and retain the explicit acknowledgement that
the level of core inflation remains somewhat elevated, which many investors would
read as a signal that the Committee prefers a core inflation rate of around 1½ percent.
The Committees concern about the inflation outlook could be stressed by noting that
considerable uncertainty surrounds the assessment that inflation is likely to
moderate and also by expanding the set of factors that could sustain inflation
pressures to include the pass-through from higher prices of energy and other
commodities.  The statement could conclude by noting that, even after the increase in
the funds rate, the Committees predominant policy concern remains the upside risk
to inflation.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 42
","Alternative C"
2007-08-07,21,"(21) The Committee might instead view recent data and developments as
indicating that the balance of risks has shifted enough to warrant cutting the target
federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as in Alternative A.  The housing market
appears to be weakening further, indicators of private spending outside of the housing
sector have been mixed of late, and credit spreads have widenedperhaps suggesting
that downside risks to growth have increased.  Moreover, members might be
concerned that recent financial strains could intensify, further reducing the availability
of credit to households and businesses and weakening consumer and investment
spending, as in the Greater housing correction with spillovers to confidence and
financial markets scenario in the Greenbook.  At the same time, recent subdued
readings on core inflation may have increased the Committees confidence that
inflation pressures are gradually ebbing.  Furthermore, with growth in labor
compensation remaining moderate, the Committee might think that the equilibrium
unemployment rate could be lower than currently estimated by the staff, as in the
Lower NAIRU Greenbook alternative scenario, suggesting that core inflation could
decline a bit more than in the staff forecast.  In these circumstances, the Committee
may judge that a slightly lower federal funds rate would more appropriately balance
the increased risk of sluggish economic growth against the reduced upside risk to

","Alternative A"
2007-09-18,21,"(21) The draft language of Alternative B repeats the observation from the
August 7 FOMC statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of
the year.  However, it drops the assessment from the August 17 statement that
recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace,
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 49
as information that has subsequently become available suggests greater weakness in
activity.  It then adapts language from the August 17 statement to note the potential
dampening effect of financial market turmoil on the housing market and the growth
outlook more generally.  The statement observes that the rate cut is intended to
forestall the effects of these developments on the economy and to promote moderate
growth over time.  This wording leaves open the possibility that growth may be
weak for a time but suggests that the longer-term outlook remains healthy.
Alternative B refrains from making any explicit characterization of the balance of
risks, stating that The Committee will continue to closely follow timely indicators of
economic prospects and will act as needed to attain its dual objectives.  Although
this sentence does not literally express any asymmetry, analysts are likely to read the
statement overall as indicating some predelication to ease policy further.  This
approach could be seen as giving the Committee flexibility going forward, either to
ease further in response to soft incoming data or to stand pat if the economy appears
to be stabilizing.  If members find Alternative B attractive, but wish to adopt an
explicit statement of balanced risks, then they might insert the sentence After todays
action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now
roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation at the start of the assessment of risk

2007-12-11,21,"(21) The draft statement for Alternative A begins with a reference to the further
intensification of the housing correction and recent weakening in business and
consumer expenditures, and it also mentions increased strains in financial markets.  It
then notes that the outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat and, unlike
Alternative B, adds that the downside risks to growth have increased.  But as in the
other alternatives, the statement suggests that the easing in policy should help foster
moderate expansion over time.  The paragraph regarding inflation is little changed
from October.  The risk assessment would indicate that the 50 basis point easing
brings the risks to inflation and growth roughly into balance.  But if the Committee
believes that, even after such a move, recent developments in financial markets have
increased the uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation to such an
extent that an assessment is not meaningful, it may wish instead to employ the risk
assessment language used in Alternative B.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-01-29,21,"(21) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative A is identical to that of
Alternative B, but this alternative elaborates further about the prospects for inflation,
pointing out that the projected moderation of inflation reflects well-anchored
inflation expectations, a projected leveling out of energy prices, and easing pressures
on resource utilization, and noting that further increases in energy and commodity
prices, as well as other factors, could put upward pressure on inflation.  Of course,
the Committee could choose simply to repeat the inflation rationale given in the
January 22 statement.  As in Alternative B, the risk assessment states that the stance
of policy should help promote moderate growth and mitigate the downside risks to
economic activity.  In light of the stronger policy action, however, this alternative
is somewhat less definitive regarding the magnitude of downside risks to growth,
indicating that such risks may well remain and that the Committee will assess
incoming information to determine whether further action is needed to address
those risks.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-06-24,21,"(21)  This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would
reduce the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to 1¾ percent, and its
statement would suggest that the further easing of policy was motivated by a
relatively downbeat assessment of the growth outlook.  Under Alternative B, the
target would be maintained at 2 percent, but the statement would point both to
somewhat diminished downside risks to growth and increased upside risks to
inflation. Alternative C envisions a 25 basis points tightening to 2¼ percent; its
statement expresses continued concern about inflation, but does not strongly
suggest that further policy firming is in train.

1971-03-09,22,"(22) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction in
terms of desired growth rates for the aggregates, and (b) to adopt as targets
the growth rates (including a 7 per cent second-quarter rise in M1) dis-
cussed earlier in connection with alternative B.

is suggested, on the assumption that the Committee would not want market
conditions to be eased on the coming period if the aggregates should fall
short of the indicated paths. A directive with this general structure--
putting primary emphasis on money market conditions rather than the
aggregates--can, of course, be used in connection with specifications
other than those shown for alternative A, with suitable language changes.

as well as excesses relative to the expected paths--on the assumption that
the Committee would not want to see the aggregates grow at less than the
indicated rates, which for the months beyond August are below those associated
with the directive the Committee adopted at its preceding meeting. If the
Committee favors a money market orientation for its primary instruction but
would prefer to see the aggregates grow at rates somewhat above those

1974-05-21,22,"(22) A further significant rise in interest rates over the
next few months may need to be followed by a decline in late summer in
order to avoid unduly limiting monetary expansion in the final months of
the year. Alternative C has the greatest potential for such a pattern,
and might well bring about a severe wrenching of market conditions.
Proposed directive
(22) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to
delete the reference to Treasury financing because the quarterly refunding
announced on May 1 has been completed and the issues largely distributed.
Also, in view of the strong connection between U.S. financial markets, the
Euro-dollar market, and foreign exchange markets, it is proposed to say
"". . .while taking account of financial market developments. . .""
without separate reference to ""international"" and ""domestic"" developments.
In alternative C, it is proposed to give special emphasis to that
phase--i.e.,"". . .while taking careful account. . .""--in view of the
strong possibility of exaggerated market reactions to the sharp rise in
interest rates associated with open market operations designed to achieve
the specified rates of growth in the aggregates.

","Alternative C, alternative C, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
1979-07-11,22,"(22) Alternative III contemplated a ½ percentage point rise
in the Federal funds over the next few weeks to the midpoint of a 10 to
II percent range. Such an approach to policy appears most consistent
with a reduction in the longer-run growth range for the aggregates, as
proposed in alternative C/C'. In the present environment, a tightening
of the funds rate objective would be expected to have rather significant
and widespread effects. The value of the dollar would strengthen in
foreign exchange markets more certainly than under alternative II, and
domestic short-term interest rates would rise considerably. The initial
reaction in bond markets would probably mirror that of short-term debt
markets. But in view of the evidence of the weakening in the economy,
market participants would be likely to see a tightening at this time as a
temporary measure. Thus, any tendency for bond yields to rise would be
limited as long-term investors sought to lock in attractive long-term yields
near their cyclical highs.
","alternative C"
1980-01-08,22,"(22) In order to achieve the 5 percent rate of growth of M-1
in the first quarter specified under alternative B, a decline in interest
rates from current levels would also be likely. The funds rate, for example,
would probably drop over the next few weeks into the lower half of the 11½
to 15½ percent rate range shown for this alternative, with the 3-month bill
rate declining to the 10 to 11 percent area. Over the first quarter the
monetary base and total reserves might have to increase at about 7½ and 2½
percent rates, respectively, and with member bank borrowings falling to
around $800 to $900 million, nonborrowed reserves would expand by about
","alternative B"
1981-12-21,22,"(22) Alternative C--which calls for virtually no growth in M1
between December and March--may be expected to bring M2 into the upper part
of its tentative long-run range by March. Essentially no growth in total
reserves would be involved, and assuming adjustment borrowing of $650 million,
nonborrowed reserves would decline at about a 2-1/2 percent rate in the first
quarter. A federal funds rate of perhaps 13 to 14 percent in the inter-
meeting period would be implied. Such a move in the funds rate would surprise
market participants, and a fairly substantial rise in other market interest
rates, at least temporarily, would tend to develop. The 3-month bill rate
would probably move to near 12-1/2 percent, the corporate bond rate might
approach 16 percent, and new issue volume would probably drop significantly
as firms return to short-term credit markets. Residential mortgage rates
would retrace part of their recent decline. The higher than expected level
of interest rates would tend to strengthen the dollar further in foreign
exchange markets and limit reductions in foreign interest rates.
","Alternative C"
1983-02-08,22,"(22) Alternative B, which might be considered as most consistent
with long-run alternative II, assumes that federal funds generally trade
somewhat below the current 8 percent discount rate. Other market rates
are likely to change little between now and the next Committee meeting
under those circumstances, with the 3-month bill rate generally in an 8 to
$200 million, with total reserves probably falling on the order of 10
percent, and nonborrowed reserves by about 7 percent, as required reserves
contract mainly reflecting continued run-offs in large CDs.
","Alternative B"
1983-12-19,22,"(22) Alternative A involves an easing of bank reserve positions-
with borrowing falling to around $400 million and federal funds dropping
to around 9 percent or a little below-that would tend to place M2 and M1 in
the upper halves of their tentative longer-run ranges by March. Over the
period from November to March, these two aggregates would be expected to
grow at annual rates of 8-3/4 and 8 percent, respectively. Growth in M3 may
exceed the upper end of its tentative longer-term range. Total and nonborrowed
reserves would grow at 4-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent annual rates, respectively,
through March.
","Alternative A"
1984-07-16,22,"(23) Alternative A involves a policy approach that keeps M1
growth nearer the upper end of its longer-run range. The 7 percent
annual growth rate for this aggregate from June to September would bring
growth from QIV '83 to September to just under 7-1/2 percent. Such money
growth, when translated to a quarterly average basis for the third
quarter, implies only a small rise in the income velocity of M1 over
the months ahead and is probably consistent with some drop in money
market rates from recent levels under existing circumstances, particularly
considering the lingering restraining effects on money demand of the
rise of interest rates over recent months. Nonborrowed reserves are
likely to expand at a 14 percent annual rate under this alternative,
with borrowing about $750 million. Borrowing in that area might involve
a federal funds rate of around 10-1/2 percent-unless the recent relative
reluctance of banks to borrow from the discount window abates, in which
case the funds rate could be lower for such a level of borrowing.
","Alternative A"
1985-02-12,22,"(22) Market interest rates would be expected to drop fairly
sharply in the near term under alternative A, especially if it was
accompanied by a lower discount rate. The Treasury bill rate might
decline to around 7-1/4 percent and CDs to about 7-1/2 percent, putting
the prime rate under considerable downward pressure. Such yield declines
would probably lead to continued strong growth of M2 and M3, particularly
of their nontransactions components. In long-term markets, yields would
also fall, though the extent of such declines might be reduced by the
very heavy volume of corporate and state and local bond issuance that
would probably ensue. In addition, rate declines in long-term markets
could be limited by concerns that such an approach might lead to an
intensification of inflationary pressures, or in any event to a tightening
of market conditions later in the year to avert such pressures and to
constrain growth in the aggregates to within the long-term ranges adopted.
In exchange markets, the dollar would be likely to come under downward
","alternative A"
1985-07-09,22,"(22) Growth of M2 and M3 under alternative B would also be
expected to slow relative to their average pace of May and June. In
addition to the moderation of M1 growth, the nontransaction components of
M2 and M3 should expand less rapidly over coming months, with inflows to
money market funds and MMDAs tapering off as their yields fall into more
normal alignment with market interest rates. Moreover, issuance of
managed liabilities in the broader aggregates is unlikely to strengthen
greatly, given expectations of some weakening in bank credit growth and
continuing constraints on thrift asset expansion from capital requirements
and market concerns about the thrifts' financial condition. Under
alternative B, M2 in September would be just below the upper end of its
current long-run range, while M3 would be expected to be a little above
the midpoint of its range.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1986-02-11,22,"(22) Under alternative A, M1 growth would be expected to pick up
to about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March, as interest
rates decline. Growth from the fourth quarter to March in this aggregate
would be at an annual rate of about 7-1/2 percent--somewhat above the
tentative longer-run range--and the lower rates would work to sustain money
growth in the ensuing months. The 7-3/4 percent growth of M2 for February
and March under this alternative would be bring this aggregate to around the
lower bound of its tentative range by quarter-end.
","alternative A"
1986-07-08,22,"(22) Alternative A contemplates an easing of reserve conditions,
characterized by frictional discount window borrowing of around $150
million and the federal funds rate averaging a little below 6-1/2 percent.
(Alternative A would also be consistent with a combination of a 6 percent
discount rate and maintenance of borrowing at the current $300 million
level.) M1 growth is projected to average around 10 percent over the
three months under these circumstances. M2 growth would be likely to
remain near its June pace, ending the quarter somewhat above the midpoint
of its range. With short-term rates drawing even closer to rates custom-
arily paid on savings deposits and regular NOWs, there could be some risk
of even faster M1 and M2 growth than specified over the summer months,
especially if depository institutions are reluctant to reduce offering
rates on these accounts. M3 growth, though, would not be expected to
accelerate as much since some of the pickup in core deposits would be
offset by reduced issuance of managed liabilities.
","Alternative A, Alternative A"
1987-02-10,22,"(22) Alternative A assumes a reduction in discount window borrow-
ing to $150 million, a near-frictional level, or a one-half percentage point
cut in the discount rate with the borrowing allowance maintained at $300
million. In either case, the federal funds rate would move down to around
with the three-month bill dropping to close to 5 percent, as there appears
to be little market expectation of monetary easing in the period immediately
ahead. Downward pressure on the dollar would intensify, absent comparable
policy moves by central banks abroad. In the context of a weaker dollar, and
possibly greater concern about inflation, the scope for long-term rates to
fall might be limited; however, should the easing in money markets be followed
by economic indicators pointing to a weaker economy and less inflationary
pressure than is now expected, long-term rates would be more likely to fall
","Alternative A"
1987-07-07,22,"(22) M3, under alternative B, would probably expand at a 7-1/2
percent annual rate, up about 2 percentage points from the March-to-June
period. While asset growth at banks and thrifts is expected to continue
around its average pace of recent months, a runoff of Treasury deposits
will lead to more issuance of managed liabilities in M3. With faster
expansion of M3 in the third quarter, its velocity would resume contract-
ing at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, broadly in line with its longer-run
","alternative B"
1988-06-29,22,"(22) The boost in opportunity costs under alternative C would reduce
monetary growth substantially below the pace of recent months. M2 would
slow to 4 percent over the June-to-September period, with inflows to its
liquid components being most affected. M1 would edge up at a 1-1/2 percent
annual rate as demand deposits declined and inflows to OCDs slowed to a
trickle. By September, M2 would be only a little above the midpoint of its
annual range and M1 would be 3-3/4 percent at an annual rate above its
fourth-quarter level. Credit demands on banks and thrifts would be damped
only a bit and these institutions would respond to smaller inflows to core
deposits by stepping up their issuance of managed liabilities. M3 should
grow at a 6-1/2 percent rate from June to September under this alternative
and drift down only slightly within its annual range.
","alternative C, alternative
a"
1989-02-07,22,"(23) Increases in short-term market rates over recent months should
restrain M2 growth through this quarter under alternative B. Some rebound
from a weak January seems in store in February and March, but M2 growth is
expected to reach only about 3 percent over the next two months, given the
glacial adjustment speed of offering rates recently, especially for liquid
February and March, M1 would decline slightly further. The 2 percent M2
growth of alternative B from December to March implies quarterly average
growth of only 3 percent for this aggregate. M2 demand is not expected to
respond to the anticipated bulge in nominal GNP in the current quarter
resulting from an imputed bounceback of farm activity from the drought
last year. Consistent with the GNP outlook in the greenbook, the income
velocity of M2 would increase this quarter at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate,
nearly twice its rate of change over the second half of 1988.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1989-07-05,22,"(22) If, in contrast, inflationary pressures turn out to be more
intense than in the greenbook forecast, perhaps because increases in labor
costs return to a more normal relationship to resource use or the dollar
falls more rapidly than expected by the staff, a substantial uptrend in
interest rates in 1990 might be appropriate. The lower bound of the M2
range in alternative III would allow the most scope for such an outcome,
although those of alternative I or II could accommodate some policy firm-
ing. But only alternative III involves a further reduction in all the
current money ranges and might seem most in accord with reinforcing the
Committee's longer-term commitment to price stability. Scope at the lower
end of the ranges also might be needed if regulatory pressure on thrifts
caused them to be substantially less aggressive in bidding for retail
deposits. However, this alternative allows no margin for faster M2 growth
than in the staff forecast, should that be warranted.
","alternative a"
1990-02-06,22,"(22) Under alternative B, the continuation of the federal funds
rate around 8-1/4 percent would accord with current market expectations
for the near term. At some point, the narrow spreads between Treasury
bills and private paper will widen, but any tendency for this to occur as
runoffs of official accounts abate will be offset to a degree by large
bill issuance through the end of March and by the continued potential of a
further increase to finance RTC working capital. Treasury bond yields may
edge down once the mid-quarter refunding issues are distributed, espe-
cially if foreign interest appears to be holding up. However, without a
surprise in macroeconomic fundamentals or monetary policy, only limited
scope for a flattening of the Treasury yield curve seems in prospect.
Increases in bond yields since the last FOMC meeting have restored the
more typical upward-sloping term structure, apparently on the basis of
expectations that federal funds trading not far from current levels will
be consistent with continued economic expansion and underlying inflation
persisting at its recent pace.
","alternative B"
1990-07-02,22,"(22) Under alternative B, market interest rates probably would
vary around current levels. The structure of interest rates does not
appear to have built in strong convictions of a near-term adjustment to
monetary policy, but does contain a hint of a 1/4 percentage point decline
in the funds rate by fall. This impression could persist for some time,
if incoming data conform to the greenbook forecast of continued slow
economic growth and no visible change in price trends. Under these cir-
cumstances, the foreign exchange value of the dollar also should remain
around recent levels, absent unexpected repercussions of the economic and
monetary union in Germany or policy moves by other major trading partners.
Both interest and exchange rates could be affected, however, by develop-
ments regarding prospective federal borrowing. Unless RTC activity slows
appreciably after midyear, which the staff does not believe likely, Trea-
sury borrowing could raise federal debt to its current statutory ceiling,
possibly as soon as early August, adding uncertainty to the credit markets
by potentially disrupting the midquarter refunding. The approach of the
debt ceiling also could heighten expectations of an imminent budget
accord, and intensify speculation on a possible shift in monetary policy.
","alternative B"
1991-02-05,22,"(22) With little market anticipation of an immediate further
easing, money market rates under alternative A are likely to fall roughly
in line with the decline of the federal funds rate. The decrease of pri-
vate rates could be a bit larger than that for Treasury bill rates, as
market participants viewed the policy easing process as providing
increased assurance of a near-term resumption of economic growth and
improved creditworthiness of borrowers in the foreseeable future. The
prime rate would be lowered another 1/2 percentage point, helping to
stimulate growth of bank credit. Judging from recent experience, bond
rates might not decline very much. The dollar would come under signif-
icant further downward pressures.
","alternative A"
1992-02-04,22,"(22) Projected monetary growth under the two alternatives is
presented below. Under both alternatives, growth in M2 would strengthen
a little over February and March from its December-January pace. Still,
growth in M2 would be fairly sluggish, despite the sharp decline in
money market rates near the end of last year; indeed, M2 velocity likely
would move higher in the first quarter under both alternatives, as hold-
ers of M2, responding in part to large declines in offering rates on M2,
continue to shift into capital market instruments and to restrain expan-
sion of balance sheets overall. M2 would remain in the lower half of
its provisional 1992 range through March under both alternatives, but
under alternative A would be on a trajectory to move up in its range
over the second quarter. An expected resumption of RTC resolution
activity would reappear as a drag on M2 late in the current quarter and
would have an even greater effect on M3. Partly as a consequence, M3
would remain in the lower half of its provisional range. In contrast,
M1 is expected to continue to expand at a double-digit pace, propelled
by further large gains in transaction deposits.

","alternative A"
1992-06-30,22,"(22) Under alternative A, most of the drop of 50 basis points
in the funds rate would be transmitted to other money market interest
rates. The prime rate would be cut a half percentage point. The
reaction of bond yields is difficult to anticipate. To the extent mar-
ket participants saw the easing as warranted by prospective economic
weakness, long-term rates would decline further on the policy easing.
On the other hand, to the degree that the action was interpreted as more
aggressive than was justified by economic fundamentals and by the pro-
spects for continued disinflation, heightened inflation concerns and an
enhanced possibility that a policy tightening may be needed in the not-
too-distant future would temper such a decline and could even bring
about some increase in nominal bond rates. Still, the easing would
provide some stimulus to economic activity as real long-term yields
moved lower and the recent weakening in the exchange value of the dollar
was extended.
","alternative A"
1993-02-02,22,"(22) Short-term interest rates--including the prime rate--
would decline by the half-point drop in the federal funds rate under
alternative A. Availability constraints on business credit at banks
might ease more noticeably should bankers come to see lower rates
as improving the outlook for business profitability and lessening
strains in this sector. If incoming information suggested that the
economic expansion had lost some of its steam--such as a weak employ-
ment report--or if the easing were seen as being associated with the
likelihood of more fiscal policy restraint, this alternative might be
viewed as needing to be reversed before long. In these circumstances,
declines in intermediate- and long-term rates would be limited. The
dollar would move lower on foreign exchange markets.
","alternative A"
1996-01-30,22,"(22) Alternative III better centers projected baseline growth
of both M2 and M3 within the ranges. Choice of this alternative would
seem to rest on the view that the ranges should be mainly oriented
toward providing Congress and the public with an estimated growth
interval for each aggregate over the relevant year that essentially
balances the risks of an over- or undershoot if the economy performs
as the Committee expects. Under such an approach, the Committee would
attempt to incorporate fully in advance intermediate-run effects, such
as responsiveness to interest-rate movements or other factors, into
the specified ranges. More willingness to adjust the current year's
ranges at mid-year also could be part of this approach. This approach
would not necessarily imply that the Committee would place more weight
on the aggregates in the conduct of policy. Indeed, the Committee
could continue to deemphasize the use of the ranges as intermediate
policy targets. Alternative III would seem especially appealing in
the context of conveying information about expected money growth if
the Committee had a fairly strong presumption that further easing
actions could well prove warranted this year to forestall an unaccep-
tably weak economic performance or to adjust to lessening inflation
pressures. Or, if the Committee accepts the relationships embedded in
the staff forecast, this alternative could seem attractive if the
Committee did not contemplate downward pressure on inflation this year
through either a deliberate or opportunistic strategy.
Short-run Policy Alternatives
","alternative c"
1996-07-02,22,"(22) A 25 basis point rise in the federal funds rate at this
meeting as under alternative C would exceed the small amount currently
built into money market yields. As a consequence, interest rates
probably would rise across the maturity spectrum, and the exchange
rate would tend to firm. The extent of the rise in intermediate- and
longer-term interest rates would depend on whether the market saw this
as the first in a series of firming actions. Some such extrapolation
seems quite probable; market participants would reason that the new
direction for policy was unlikely to be limited to only a 1/4 percent-
age point increase, and might read the action as suggesting that the
Federal Reserve saw inflation pressures as relatively strong. The
interest rate increase might be more circumscribed if the tightening
were implemented through open market operations rather than by raising
the discount rate, and if the announcement emphasized that the Federal
Reserve itself saw the action as a limited adjustment reflecting, for
example, a view that the easing undertaken at the end of January to
gain greater assurance of satisfactory economic growth was no longer
needed. In any case, the large backup in intermediate- and long-term
yields that was associated with the initial firming in 1994 is
unlikely to be repeated: Nominal and real federal funds rates were
much lower then, and the Federal Reserve's public posture at that time
was that a substantial policy adjustment was to be expected. If the
Committee were to tighten more aggressively, by 50 basis points, real
rates would ratchet significantly higher, but the rise in nominal
longer-term rates might be limited by the perception of timely and
decisive action to counter a buildup in inflationary pressures. There
is some risk that market participants would read the action as sig-
nalling that the Federal Reserve was quite concerned that the economy
had excessive momentum and was prepared to tighten considerably fur-
ther, prompting a very substantial upward movement in interest rates,
especially in short and intermediate maturities, and in the dollar.

1997-02-04,22,"(22) Financial markets currently are not anticipating a change in policy at the
February meeting, and thus the choice of alternative B should initially have little impact on
interest rates or the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Over the course of the intermeeting
period, the downshifting of growth in early 1997 in the staff forecast probably is greater than
expected by market participants and the news on inflation is a little better, and rates could
edge lower. Moreover, signs of a political deal to balance the budget, which the staff
assumes will be struck at some point, could put some additional downward pressure on long-
term rates, especially if it involved entitlements and hence trimmed deficits beyond 2002.
The course of equity prices is particularly uncertain in view of their lofty valuations. While a
correction cannot be ruled out, earnings reports, especially those still coming in for the strong
fourth quarter, should remain favorable in the period just ahead, and with little change in
interest rates, equity prices could well hold around recent levels.
","alternative B"
1998-06-30,22,"(22) The choice of the unchanged policy stance of alternative B would seem to
follow if the Committee found the Greenbook forecast both probable and--despite the
projected upcreep in underlying inflation--acceptable. The Committee might be especially
willing to live with an outlook in which the most likely outcome was a modest increase in
inflation if it saw the risks around that outcome as unbalanced, with the odds of a
considerably larger and persistent rise in inflation less than those of a substantial weakening
in activity. Even if underlying inflation tendencies turn out to be a little more intense than
anticipated, weakness in commodity and import prices and damped inflation expectations
should restrain price increases for a time. Thus, the Committee should be able to react
sufficiently promptly to any emerging cost pressures in labor markets to limit any incipient
increase in inflation and inflation expectations. On the demand side, an important
vulnerability of the staff forecast revolves around developments overseas. That forecast
embodies more stable foreign financial markets and a recovery in the Japanese economy
starting in the second half of the year. However, so long as conditions in Asian economies
and emerging market economies elsewhere stay unsettled and the eventual implementation of
effective measures to deal with those conditions remains uncertain, the Committee may see a
distinct possibility of substantially greater drag on the U.S. economy from the external sector
than is in the staff forecast. Moreover, developments abroad may not be wholly immune to
monetary policy actions within the United States, and the Committee might be willing to
delay action for a time, at the risk of a possible pickup in inflation, to avoid further
complicating the already unsteady situation in Asia and several non-Asian emerging market
","alternative B"
1999-02-02,22,"(22) Investors place high odds on monetary policy being left unchanged at this
meeting. Thus, if the intended funds rate were left at 4-3/4 percent, as under alternative B, short-
and long-term interest rates should hold near their current levels, as would the value of the dollar
on foreign exchange markets. Over the intermeeting period, however, if data on the economy
and prices come in along the lines of the staff forecast, intermediate- and long-term rates could
back up some as investors continue to unwind their expectations of any further easing of Federal
Reserve policy later in the year. Under the anticipated conditions of solid economic growth,
concerns about credit quality should abate further, and bond market spreads should edge down a
little from their current high levels.
","alternative B"
1999-06-29,22,"(22) The Committee might nonetheless favor the unchanged federal funds rate of
alternative B if it did not view the prospects for a rise in inflation as having increased since
the last meeting, when it saw the risks as tilted, but not enough to tighten. The staff sees
the growth of GDP slowing in the second and third quarters to about the pace of its
potential. This slowing presumably does not owe in any appreciable way to the firming of
financial conditions over May and June and could reflect more fundamental tendencies of
aggregate demand. If so, a partial reversal of that financial market firming, which would
occur under this alternative, would not lead to tauter labor markets, especially if continued
rapid growth in productivity were viewed as a reasonable prospect. Furthermore, CPI data
that have become available since the last Committee meeting have extended the downward
trend in the twelve-month change in core prices, underlining uncertainties about the supply
side of the economy. In these circumstances, before tightening policy, the Committee may
want to see more concrete evidence that the economy was growing faster than its potential
or that upward pressures in costs and prices were emerging.
","alternative B"
2005-02-01,22,"(22) Adoption of all aspects of Alternative Athat is, keeping the funds rate
unchanged and softening the cast of the statement languagewould come as a
considerable surprise to market participants, especially after the release of the minutes
of the December meeting.  If the Committee chose a more limited number of the
changes in that column of Table 1, investors would probably mark down their
expectations for the path of policy, causing a decline in short- and longer-term
interest rates, a stock market rally, and a drop in the foreign exchange value of the
dollar.  The decline in longer-term interest rates would be larger and the rise in stock
prices would be smaller to the degree that investors responded to the surprising
FOMC statement by marking down their outlook for economic activity.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative A"
2006-05-10,22,"(22) Both the absence of policy action and the statement associated with
Alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  Short-
term market rates would probably drop by about 25 basis points as market
participants removed all but a small probability of near-term policy firming.  The
effect on bond yields would depend in part on whether inflation expectations were

adversely affected by the lack of tightening at this meeting and the suggestion that
policy could be on hold for some time.  If inflation expectations were unperturbed,
bond yields most likely would decline, stock markets rally, and the foreign exchange
value of the dollar weaken.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative A"
2006-10-24,22,"(22) In order to point out the downside risks to growth, the statement
accompanying Alternative A could note that there is a risk that the slowdown in
economic growth may become more pronounced.  To simplify the statement, the
Committee might want to remove from the discussion of inflation the reference to
the high levels of the prices of energy and other commodities.  Indeed, the
Committee might see some merit in this simplification for the other alternatives as
well.  Given the competing risks to inflation and growth, the risk assessment might
simply state that In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 42
the evolution of the outlook for inflation and economic growth, as implied by
incoming information.
","Alternative A"
2007-01-30,22,"(22) Under Alternative C, the paragraph on economic activity in the rationale
section notes the improvement in economic growth and observes that the housing
market may be stabilizing.  The announcement also points out that, despite modest
improvements, readings on core inflation remain elevated and that the extent and
speed of further moderation in inflation remains uncertain.  In its assessment of risks,
the Committee would once again indicate that inflation risks are the predominant
concern, but could omit the clause referring to the extent and timing of any
additional firming in the last sentence.  Instead, the statement would note that in
the near term policy firming is more likely than policy easing, which may better
reflect the Committees views regarding the range of likely outcomes about the
direction of policy, especially following a firming at this meeting and the change in
other forward-looking language.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 38
","Alternative C"
2007-03-20,22,"(22) Although investors apparently expect the Committee to begin easing by
mid-year, the immediate quarter-point rate cut envisioned in Alternative A would be a
considerable surprise and likely would lead to a significant easing of financial
conditions.  Long-term yields might follow short-term rates down if markets conclude
that the Committee believes that prospects for growth have weakened appreciably,
reducing the equilibrium real interest rate consistent with sustainable growth.  The
drop in longer-term yields could be small if markets conclude that the Committee is
easing sooner than expected but will not cut rates more over the next few years than
is already incorporated in financial quotes.  But markets might read an announcement
along the lines of Alternative A as an indication that the Committee is willing to
forego a medium-term moderation in inflation in order to sustain economic growth.
In that case, measures of inflation compensation might rise.
","Alternative A, Alternative A"
2007-08-07,22,"(22) The draft statement in Alternative A continues to note that the economy
seems likely to expand at a moderate pace, but it also explicitly recognizes that greater
weakness in the housing sector and the diminished availability and higher cost of
credit to riskier borrowers have raised the odds that the economy will grow less than
expected.  In the inflation paragraph, the draft language not only indicates that core
inflation has been subdued in recent months, it also states that core inflation is
expected to be moderate over coming quarters rather than repeating the view that a
sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.
But the statement would continue to indicate that the high level of resource utilization
poses an upside risk to inflation.  The statement could conclude by noting that, after
the 25 basis point easing, the Committee views the downside risk to growth as roughly
balanced by the upside risk to inflation.  Such an assessment would imply that the
Committee does not see the easing as likely to be the first of a sequence of moves.
","Alternative A"
2007-09-18,22,"(22) Measuring market expectations is especially challenging in the current
environment, but investors appear to place substantial odds on two possible target
rate decisions at this meetinga quarter-point cut and a half-point cutand seem to
envision cumulative easing of 75 to 100 basis points by the end of this year.  With
Alternative B putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some
possibility of further rate cuts, this alternative would likely prompt a modest decline in
short-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might edge
lower.  However, intermediate-term interest rates would probably change relatively
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 26 of 49
little.  The effect on equity, credit, and term funding markets would depend on how
investors interpreted the decision.  They would most likely conclude that the sizable
policy response may offset some of the macroeconomic effects of credit market
turmoil, leading equity prices to rally and risk spreads to narrow.  But it is possible
that the relatively large policy move and the statement could lead investors to infer
that the growth outlook is weaker than they had previously thought, having the
opposite effect.  Going forward, the reference to the Committee closely following
timely indicators may sharpen the sensitivity of markets to near-term and forward-
looking economic data.
","Alternative B"
2007-10-30,22,"(22) If the Committee has a modal outlook similar to the Greenbook projection
that growth will return to potential in a few quarters and sees the risks around that
forecast as relatively balanced, it might be inclined to choose Alternative C.  Under
this alternative, there would be no change in the target federal funds rate, and the
statement would indicate that downside risks to growth are balanced by upside risks
to inflation.  Members might view the partial easing of the strains in financial markets
since mid-summer as substantially reducing the likelihood that instability in the
financial system will undermine economic performance, especially since there do not
appear to have been significant spillovers to consumer and business spending as yet.
Indeed, the Committee may see the improved financial market conditions and the
outlook for growth near potential in 2008 and 2009 as close to the situation it
envisioned after the September policy easing.  Even if the Committee believes that
ongoing financial strains pose downside risks to growth, it may also believe that those
risks are partly offset by other factors.  For example, Committee members might be
more optimistic than the staff regarding the persistence of the recent robust growth in
business fixed investment and household consumption, along the lines of the
Greater Momentum in Aggregate Demand alternative scenario in the Greenbook.
On the inflation side, the Committee may have become more worried about the
potential for renewed price pressures.  While inflation readings have remained
relatively benign, the Committee might view the increase in energy prices over the
past few weeks as likely to push up overall inflation in the near term, with potential
adverse effects on inflation expectations.  Indeed, the Committee may be concerned
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 44
by the increase since earlier this year of around 25 basis points in forward inflation
compensation implied by TIPS securities.  The weakening of the dollar may also be
seen as posing a greater inflationary threat than foreseen by the staff.  Some members
may also be worried that current levels of resource utilization are not sustainable and
pose an upside risk to inflation.  Others may see particularly high costs to an increase
in inflation from its recent readings and, partly for that reason, may have little
expectation that a near-term easing of policy would be warranted.  Under these
circumstances, the Committee might judge that the current stance of policy is
appropriate and believe that the downside risks to growth are balanced by upside risks
to inflation.
","Alternative C"
2008-01-29,22,"(22) Although market participants appear to see only about one-tenth odds
that the funds rate target will be reduced by 75 basis points at this meeting, the risk
assessment in this alternative would likely be read as indicating a somewhat lower
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 29 of 38
probability of further easing over the next few months.  Thus, this policy action might
be viewed largely as a timing surprise, especially since futures contracts indicate that
investors expect the funds rate to decline to about 2¾ percent by the March FOMC
meeting.  Consequently, the impact on Treasury coupon yields could be rather limited.
Of course, this policy move might bolster market confidence and help alleviate
perceptions of tail risks to the macroeconomy, causing equity prices to rise and credit
spreads on corporate debt to narrow.  However, this alternative could also heighten
concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook, in which case forward inflation
compensation might rise noticeably further and the foreign exchange value of the
dollar could depreciate.
","alternative c"
2008-04-29,22,"(22) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would
reduce the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1¾ percent, under
Alternative B the federal funds rate target would be cut by 25 basis points to 2
percent, and under Alternative C the Committee would maintain the federal funds
rate target at 2¼ percent.  In contrast to the FOMC statement in March, the risk
assessments in Alternatives A and B no longer emphasize the downside risks to
growth and so convey a more neutral policy stance.  Alternative B indicates that
the pace of interest rate reductions may need to slow in order for the Committee
to assess better the effects of policy actions taken to date, whereas Alternative A
reiterates that the Committee stands ready to act in a timely manner.  Alternative C
retains the judgment that downside risks to growth remain and explains that the
Committees decision to pause at this meeting was to allow more time to assess the
effects of past policy actions.  As usual, the Committee could formulate its
statement using language from more than one alternative.  Table 1 may need to be
modified once participants have submitted their economic projections in order to
ensure that the draft statements are consistent with the projections and the
accompanying narratives.

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A
and B, the target federal funds rate would be maintained at 2 percent at this meeting.
Alternative C includes a 25 basis point tightening.  Compared with the statement
released after the August meeting, all three alternatives would still note that inflation
has been high, but the focus of the discussion of economic activity has shifted from
the expansion in the second quarter to the slowdown evident in recent months.  In
addition, a slowing in export growth is included as a factor likely to weigh on the pace
of economic activity over the next few quarters.  Apart from these changes,
Alternative B is little different from the Committees statement in August.  Alternative
C expresses the Committees significant concern that inflation may not moderate as
anticipated, and states that the policy action was intended to better promote
acceptable progress toward price stability.  Alternative A indicates greater confidence
that inflation will moderate and suggests that downside risks to growth and upside
risks to inflation are now roughly balanced.

the aggregates because the paths anticipated for both M1 and M2 involve
some gradual slowing on average in coming months.

","alternative A"
1979-07-11,23,"(23) Alternative I involves a percentage point decrease in the
Federal funds rate to the center of a 9 to 10 percent range. Such a move
appears most consistent with the higher longer-run growth rates for the
monetary aggregates associated with alternative A/A'. It would not
necessarily be inconsistent with longer-run alternative B, under which
interest rates are expected to begin declining later in the summer or in
early fall. A modest reduction in the Federal funds rate over the near
term, especially if it occurs along with new data suggesting further weak-
ness in economic activity, is likely to be accompanied by a fairly
substantial drop in market rates--as market participants come to expect
even more monetary ease ahead. In this environment, the dollar would
probably weaken substantially further on exchange markets, and the spread
of Treasury bill rates below private rates would widen as foreign official
institutions acquired Treasury securities in the wake of intervention
activity. The drop in Treasury bill rates will reintroduce a full 25
basis points differential on MMC ceiling rates in favor of thrift
institutions, leading to weaker M-2 growth in the short run under
alternative I than under alternative II.
Directive language
","alternative A, alternative B"
1980-01-08,23,"(23) Even the more modest decline in money market rates
associated with alternative B is likely to induce a rally in bond markets
as it becomes clear that interest rates have peaked. The decline in
mortgage rates would probably be moderate, though. Net inflows of funds
to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their
second half of 1979 pace, and costs of such funds would not decline as
much as under alternative A. The exchange value of the dollar under
alternative B is likely to decline somewhat as market participants focus
on the decline of interest rates, but there would be less downward pressure
than under alternative A, in part because any interest rate declines under
alternative B would be associated with slower money growth.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative B, alternative A, alternative B"
1981-07-06,23,"(23) Alternative C calls for more constraint on reserve growth
over the next three months than alternative B--with total reserves growing
at an 8 percent annual rate--should the Committee wish, for example,
to take an approach that provided greater assurance that broader aggregates
would come within current longer-run ranges. This alternative involves
M1-B growth at a 6½ percent annual rate over the next three months, which
would leave this aggregate still well below its present longer-run range
by September. Sizable upward pressure on interest rates over the period
ahead is likely to be generated under this approach, with the funds rate
moving above 20 percent and borrowing at the discount window probably
moving over $2½ billion. The dollar likely would rise rather substantially
on foreign exchange markets, possibly reaching levels that would generate
considerable intervention by foreign countries and related sales of
U.S. Government securities. The financial market pressures associated
with this alternative might not be long sustained, though, as high financing
costs and added strains on key financial intermediaries lead to a marked
near-term weakening in aggregate demand.
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1981-12-21,23,"(23) As 1982 progresses, short-term interest rates likely will
rise to levels above those currently prevailing, assuming M1 grows at the
midpoint of the FOMC's tentative range. The table below shows interest
rate forecasts for the year, assuming alternative B for the first quarter
and midpoint growth of M1 thereafter. These assumptions lie behind the
Greenbook GNP projection. Selection of alternative A might involve a
larger rise in rates later in the year to compensate for the greater near-
term monetary stimulus associated with this approach if the Committee desires
to slow money growth later in an effort to achieve midpoint growth for the
year. Alternative C, on the other hand, by exerting near-term restraint
would probably be associated with lower rate levels later in the year,
reflecting not only the greater scope for faster money growth at that time
but also possibly weaker economic activity.

1983-02-08,23,"(23) Somewhat easier market conditions are implied by alternative
A, which involves a drop in the funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area.
Such a decline would probably entail a further ½ percentage point reduction
in the discount rate. Assuming a cut in the discount rate, the money market
specifications of alternative A would generally be consistent with borrowing
in the $150 million to $200 million range. Both short- and long-term market
rates would be expected to adjust downward. However, whether the decline
in long-term rates would be sustainable will depend in part on whether
incoming economic news and the budgetary outlook tend to raise market
concerns about the sustainability of easier money market conditions. The
dollar likely would resume its decline on foreign exchange markets.
","alternative
A, alternative A"
1983-07-12,23,"(23) Alternative B encompasses a further increase in pressures
on bank reserve positions in an effort to increase the-odds that growth
in the broad monetary aggregates will remain within their longer-run
target ranges and to exert even more restraint on growth of M1. This
alternative would involve borrowing from the discount window in the $850
million to $1 billion range (given the present discount rate), and the
federal funds rate might be expected to move well into the 9½ to 10 percent
area. Total reserves are likely to expand at about 2¼ percent annual rate
over the June to September period. Nonborrowed reserves would be about
flat if the level of borrowing rose to the range specified.
","Alternative B"
1984-01-30,23,"(23) Given below are two alternative approaches to the directive
paragraphs that specify the long-run ranges for 1984 and the objectives for
operations over the intermeeting period. The first alternative retains the
present degree of emphasis on M1, while the second is suggested should the
Committee wish to place additional weight on that aggregate.
Alternative 1 (No change in M1 emphasis)
The proposed language related to the long-term ranges is presented
in paragraphs (a) and (b) and language related to operations is shown in
paragraph (c). Paragraph (a) presents the long-run targets in the same
order and with essentially the same language as in the current directive.
The qualifying language in the current directive about the relationship of
the aggregates to economic goals is shown in brackets at the end of para-
graph (a)--with suggested modifications indicated--should the Committee still
wish to emphasize particular uncertainties in that respect. Paragraph (b),
taken without change from the present directive, indicates weights to the
given to the various aggregates and other factors in policy implementation.
Proposed Language for Long-term Ranges
(a) The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary
and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,
promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a
sustainable pattern of international transactions. In furtherance
of these objectives the Committee established growth ranges for
the broader aggregates of ____ to ____ percent for M2 and ____ to ____
percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the
fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee considered that growth of M1
in a range of ____ to ____ percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to
the fourth quarter of 1984 would be consistent with the ranges
for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total
domestic nonfinancial debt was set at ____ to ____ percent for
such ranges and ultimate economic goals MAY have become less
predictable; that the impact of {DEL: new] DEREGULATED deposit
accounts on [DEL: growth] ONGOING BEHAVIOR of monetary aggregates
cannot YET be determined with a high degree of confidence; and
that the availability of interest on large portions of transac-
tion accounts may be reflected in some changes in the historical
trends in velocity.]
(b) In implementing monetary policy, the Committee
agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on
the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior
of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt would be monitored,
with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on
evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predict-
able patterns. The Comittee understood that policy implementation
would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between
the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, includ-
ing evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign
exchange markets.
Proposed Operational Paragraph
(c) The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain
at least (or MAINTAIN/INCREASE SLIGHTLY/DECREASE SLIGHTLY) the
existing degree of reserve restraint, TAKING ACCOUNT OF EFFECTS
OF THE SHIFT TO THE CONTEMPORANEOUS RESERVE REQUIREMENT SYSTEM,
PARTICULARLY IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION,
ON RESERVE MANAGEMENT BY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. The action is
is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual
rates of around [DEL: 8]____ AND ____ percent RESPECTIVELY from November to
March. The Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual
rate of around [DEL: 6] ____ percent from November to March will be
consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates, and
that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt WILL BE
WITHIN THE RANGE ESTABLISHED FOR THE YEAR [DEL: would continue at
around its recent pace]. Depending on evidence about the con-
tinuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing
on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint
would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly
Proposed Language for Long-term Ranges
(d) The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster
monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce
inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable
basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international
transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee
established the following growth ranges for monetary and credit
aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the
fourth quarter of 1984: ____ to ____ percent for M1, ____ to
____ percent for M2, and ____ to ____ percent for M3. The associated
range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at ____ to ____
percent in 1984.
(e) In implementing monetary policy the Committee
agreed to increase somewhat the weight on M1 as behavior of its
velocity has recently been broadly consistent with historical
patterns. Still, uncertainties remain about the future behavior
of M1 velocity, in view of the substantial changes in the com-
position of M1 and the characteristics of deposits in this
aggregate; and the Committee will continue to place substantial
weight on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates and to
monitor expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt. In
general, the Committee understood that policy implementation
would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between
the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, in-
cluding evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign
exchange markets.
Proposed Operational Paragraph
(f) The Committee seeks in the short run to main-
tain at least (or MAINTAIN/INCREASE SLIGHTLY/DECREASE SLIGHTLY)
the existing degree of reserve restraint, TAKING ACCOUNT OF
EFFECTS OF THE SHIFT TO THE CONTEMPORANEOUS RESERVE REQUIRE-
MENT SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
ITS IMPLEMENTATION, ON RESERVE MANAGEMENT BY DEPOSITORY INSTITU-
TIONS. THE ACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH OF
Ml, M2, AND M3 AT ANNUAL RATES OF AROUND ____ PERCENT, ____ PERCENT,
AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH. EXPANSION
OF NONFINANCIAL DEBT IS EXPECTED TO BE WITHIN THE RANGE ESTAB-
LISHED FOR THE YEAR. Depending on evidence about the continuing
strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the
business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint
would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly
","alternative a"
1985-02-12,23,"(23) Alternative C specifies a sharper slowing of money growth
in February and March, consistent with a more rapid return of the
aggregates toward their longer-run ranges, an approach that may be
particularly in line with a Comittee choice of long-run alternative
III. M1 growth of around 6-1/4 percent over February and March under this
alternative would require restraining growth in total reserves to a 7
percent annual rate. This may be consistent with growth of nonborrowed
reserves of 2-1/2 percent, and a rise in borrowing to the $600-700 million
area. The federal funds rate would probably rise to around 9 percent.
","Alternative C"
1986-02-11,23,"(23) The exact response of these monetary aggregates, especially
M1, to the lessening of reserve pressures under alternative A is somewhat
difficult to assess. There would seem to be some risk of a more pronounced
upward thrust to M1 (and perhaps also M2) growth than specified as market
rates decline under this alternative. A further decline of market rates
could bring the spread between short-term market instruments and checkable
accounts to quite low levels depending on institutional reactions, with the
potential for strong inflows as the opportunity cost of liquidity and safety
becomes less practically significant.
","alternative A"
1987-02-10,23,"(23) Under alternative A, M2 growth would slow only moderately
from its pace of recent months and the level of M2 in March would be within
the alternative I long-run range, but near the upper end of the alternative
II range and above the alternative III growth cone. Similarly, the decelera-
tion in M3 would be less pronounced, although this aggregate in March would
be below even the upper end of its alternative III long-run range. Flows
into retail accounts are likely to strengthen even further, though this would
be muted to the degree that mounting cost pressures encouraged depository
institutions to no longer delay downward adjustments in offering rates on
retail deposits, especially OCDs and savings deposits. Absent a major adjust-
ment, M1 growth in March might return to close to the 15 percent path of
funds and heavier bank funding needs as businesses took down more bank loans,
especially if long-term rates did not register appreciable declines.
","alternative A"
1987-07-07,23,"(23) M1 would be expected to grow at a 4 percent annual rate
over the June-to-September period under alternative B, implying quarterly
average growth at only a 1 percent rate and the first M1 velocity in-
crease-at a 5 percent rate--in nearly three years. As adjustments to
the earlier rise in opportunity costs of holding both demand deposits and
OCDs taper off, these components would resume expanding, but the extent
of any pickup would be limited by the persistence of significantly higher
opportunity costs relative both to market instruments and time deposits.
","alternative B"
1988-06-29,23,"(23) The reversal of part of the recent tightening, as envisioned under
alternative A, would result in some edging down of short-term rates, espe-
cially on private securities, perhaps heading off any increase in the prime
rate. The dollar probably would reverse some of its recent strength. The
extent and persistence of any downward movement in the dollar and the effect
of an easing in policy on bond yields would depend partly on whether such an
action raised questions about the Federal Reserve's policy intentions. M2
would slow relatively little under these conditions, leaving this aggregate
on a trajectory that would tend to keep it noticeably above the midpoint of
its annual range, while M3 would move up in its range.
Directive language
","alternative A"
1989-02-07,23,"(24) M3 growth under alternative B should strengthen from its
January lull to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March,
bringing growth from December to March to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate.
Total thrift deposits, flat in December and January, are expected to ex-
pand weakly over February and March, and S&Ls should continue their reli-
ance on new FHLB advances and other non-M3 borrowing. A bulge in bank
credit associated with financing of the RJR-Nabisco takeover, while other
LBO and merger-related lending remains heavy, should induce substantial
issuance of large CDs this month and next. Corporate restructuring
activity also will be boosting overall debt issuance by domestic nonfinan-
cial sectors for a time. The debt aggregate is projected to grow at a
are forecast at a record $200 billion annual rate for the quarter, while
the corporate financing gap holds steady at around an $80 billion annual
","alternative B"
1990-02-06,23,"(23) Growth in M2 under alternative B is expected to strengthen
in February and March from its January pace, owing largely to a rebound in
transaction deposits. Demand deposits in particular should recover ap-
preciably after their sharp January slide considering the presumed in-
crease in desired holdings in response to the fall in short-term interest
rates over the second half of last year. M1 expansion would be brought
up to a 6-3/4 percent pace over February and March. Together with a
slight pickup in its nontransaction component, M2 is projected to grow at
a 7-3/4 percent rate over the two months, and 7 percent from a December
base. M2 would continue to outpace nominal GNP in the first quarter,
implying a contraction of its velocity at a 1-1/2 percent rate.
","alternative B"
1990-07-02,23,"(23) Growth rates for the monetary aggregates projected to accom-
pany the three alternatives are presented in the table below. (The table
and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.) These growth
rates reflect the staff's assessment that the thrift restructuring and
other factors have reduced the path of money growth consistent with any
given combination of income and interest rates. Thus, even under the
essentially stable interest rates of alternative B, the staff now foresees
M2 increasing at a 3 percent annual rate from June to September, only a
little faster than in June, leaving this aggregate 3-1/2 percent at an

at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, about the same as in
the second quarter. Owing primarily to the continued rapid pace of RTC
activity, M3 is projected to grow at only a 1 percent rate from June to
September under alternative B, remaining well below its current range.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1992-02-04,23,"(23) The markets appear to have built in no policy moves in
the period just ahead and thus unchanged reserve market conditions
under alternative B should have no effect on interest rates. The
course of interest rates thus will depend on developments in fiscal
policy and the economy. In the former area, investors will be assess-
ing the implications of emerging agreements for the longer-term fiscal
outlook. Interest rates could move lower should incoming economic
indicators, as in the staff economic forecast, continue to point to a
flat economy in the near-term and further gains on inflation. If
rates were to edge down, the dollar might come under some downward
pressure, but it is not expected to change significantly under this
","alternative B"
1992-06-30,23,"(23) The increase of 50 basis points in the funds rate under
alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market partici-
pants. Short-term rates would back up by at least as much, and the
dollar exchange rate would strengthen appreciably. The surprise element
itself could well trigger a flurry of selling pressures on longer-term
securities. Later, market reflection about the System's anti-inflation-
ary resolve, combined with favorable incoming price data, might well
engender a bond-market rally, leaving nominal long-term rates not much
above their current levels.
","alternative C"
1993-02-02,23,"(23) Although market participants seem to believe that some
tightening of monetary policy over the next year will be forthcoming,
they do not see this happening soon and thus would be surprised by the
election of alternative C. Short-term rates would rise by about 1/2
percentage point. Long-term rates, too, would rise, although the boost
to nominal rates would be held in check by the associated better out-
look for disinflation. The dollar would climb higher on foreign
exchange markets.
","alternative C"
1996-01-30,23,"(23) The unchanged funds rate of alternative B is consistent
with the staff Greenbook forecast. In that forecast, with a steady
nominal funds rate, the unemployment rate remains a touch below the
staff's estimate of the natural rate and core inflation edges higher,
but only to about 3 percent in 1997. Not only might alternative B be
seen as attractive if the Committee concurred with this outlook and
found the results acceptable, but it also might have appeal as a ""wait
and see"" strategy because delays in data have curtailed the new infor-
mation available to the Committee since it eased policy in December.
A similar point could be made about the fiscal situation, which might
be clarified to some extent in the next few weeks given negotiations
now underway between the President and Congressional leaders.
","alternative B, alternative B"
1996-07-02,23,"(23) The money and credit flows associated with a flat
federal funds rate under alternative B were discussed in the previous
sections of this document under the baseline case. In sum, the staff
would expect money and credit growth at or below their rates in the
first half, keeping M2 and M3 near the upper ends of their ranges and
debt in the middle of its range. Money growth would be expected to
slow somewhat more under alternative C, putting the broad aggregates
on paths more likely to leave them below the upper ends of their
longer-term ranges.
Directive Language
","alternative B, alternative C"
1997-02-04,23,"(23) Although the real federal funds rate is not low by historic standards, the run-up
in share prices along with the generous provision of credit to most borrowers are seen as
contributing to unsustainably accommodative financial conditions in the staff forecast. While
inflation does not deteriorate appreciably in the near term, given the lags in the effect of
policy, the sooner the Committee begins to tighten--as under alternative C--the lower the odds
that higher inflation will become embedded in price and wage setting. The discussion in the
long-run strategies section suggested that a rise in the funds rate of 125 basis points by late
","alternative C"
1998-02-03,23,"(23) The Committee may see sufficient chances of a shortfall in activity from the
staff forecast to suggest a small easing at this time--as in the 25 basis point decline in the
federal funds rate under alternative A. The Committee has held the nominal federal funds
rate constant since March, even as inflation and inflation expectations have fallen, raising the
real funds rate to a high level. The rise in the real funds rate may have been viewed as a
beneficial development when risks in the economic outlook seemed tilted toward strong
economic growth and a rising output gap. However, given forecasts that now see appreciably
slower growth and lower inflation than was earlier foreseen, the Committee may now interpret
the recent increase in the short-term real rate as risking tighter financial conditions than would
be consistent with satisfactory economic performance. Indeed, the very damped behavior of
the CPI over the first half of this year in the staff forecast may portend a further reduction in
inflation expectations and an additional rise in real short-term rates over coming months if the
nominal funds rate were left unchanged. To date, the steady nominal funds rate does not
seem to have appreciably impeded the drop in nominal, and possibly real, long-term rates as
the market took out expected tightening and built in a small ease. But at some point, failure
to ratify current expectations might put upward pressure on rates, nominal and real, and more
certainly would inhibit the pricing in of further easing. This suggests that an easing of policy
could have an unusually pronounced effect on long-term rates over time because it would
facilitate building in further easing, as well as reduce short-term rates by nearly the full 25
basis point decline in the funds rate. The drop in yields would tend to boost equity prices
and depress the dollar.
","alternative A"
1998-06-30,23,"(23) Financial market prices appear to embody the anticipation that monetary policy
is on hold for some time, so the choice of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B
should elicit little response in money, capital, or foreign exchange markets. If the economic
data reveal, as under the staff projection, a considerable slowing in spending and muted
inflation, intermediate- and longer-term yields could edge lower, while equity prices could
falter as corporate profits again prove disappointing. This downward pressure on yields,
however, may be offset somewhat to the extent that the situation in emerging markets does
show signs of stabilizing as in the forecast, perhaps unwinding some of the flight-to-quality
effects that Treasury yields now reflect.
","alternative B"
1999-02-02,23,"(23) In light of prevailing expectations about monetary policy, financial markets would
react sharply to the tightening of alternative C. Unless the policy announcement hinted strongly
that the FOMC saw the move as a limited action, say intended to reverse some of the extra
""insurance"" against adverse financial developments that was put in place with the last easing,
the backup in interest rates could be particularly large. Market participants might be concerned
that the move signaled that inflation risks were more serious than previously thought and could
well be followed by additional tightening. The prospects for rising debt-service burdens might
lead to some increase in risk premiums. The advance in yields on private securities could
provoke a substantial correction in equity prices, as investors trimmed expectations of profits and
discounted expected earnings at higher rates. The value of the dollar on foreign exchange
markets could rise appreciably.
","alternative C"
2007-01-30,23,"(23) The choice of Alternative C would stun market participants, leading to an
upward revision of their short-term outlook for the path of policy and a significant
rise in short- and intermediate-term interest rates.  Longer-term rates would likely step
up, especially if market participants became concerned that the inflation outlook is
less benign than they had thought.  That said, by reaffirming the Committees
determination to reduce inflation, this policy action might also lead market
participants to expect a more rapid decline in inflation and possibly even to revise
downward their perceptions of the Committees long-term inflation objective.  If this
is the case, long-term forward rates might decline and the foreign exchange value of
the dollar could strengthen.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2007-03-20,23,"(23) Though much of the market commentary during the intermeeting period
focused on developments pointing to weaker-than-expected growth, the Committee
might see the recent data releases as only a bit weaker than expected and judge that
the fallout from developments in the subprime mortgage sector will be limited,
perhaps for the reasons given in Part I of the Greenbook.  If so, the Committee might
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 41
place greater weight on the step-up in core inflation in January and the recent
depreciation of the dollar.  Especially if Fridays inflation report proves markedly
higher than expected, the Committee may be less confident than the staff that core
inflation will decline from its uncomfortably high level with no further increase in the
federal funds rate, inclining members toward the quarter-point policy firming of
Alternative C.  A judgment that tighter policy is appropriate might be buttressed by
concerns about the extent to which the labor market currently is stretched thin and
the slow pace at which those pressures lessen in the staff forecast.
","Alternative C"
2007-06-27,23,"(23) Against the backdrop of the recent sharp rise in interest rates and an already
weak housing market and following a number of benign inflation readings, members
may feel that the risk of unacceptably sluggish economic growth is now greater than
the upside risk to inflation.  If so, the Committee might wish to lower the target
federal funds rate by 25 basis points as in Alternative A.  The Committee might view
the recent backup in long-term yields as owing mainly to an exogenous rebound in
term premiums from an abnormally low level.  A rising term premium could dampen
consumer and business spending and further weaken the housing market, a possibility
explored in the Greenbook alternative simulation Tighter financial conditions.  In
light of this possibility, the Committee may believe that a lower federal funds rate is
required to maintain the desired strength of aggregate demand.  Furthermore, with
low unemployment not clearly boosting labor costs, the Committee might think that
the NAIRU could well be lower than currently estimated by the staffas in the
lower NAIRU Greenbook alternative scenario.  In this case, it may judge that a
slightly more accommodative stance of monetary policy would run little risk of
stoking inflationary pressures, especially since the real funds rate is now above the
range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium.
","Alternative A"
2007-09-18,23,"(23) If members are particularly pessimistic about the growth outlook, or see
the downside risks as especially large, then they may prefer to both ease 50 basis
points and explicitly point to downside risks in order to maximize the scope for
further near-term policy action, as envisioned in Alternative A.  Members might view
the current configuration of asset prices and credit spreads as possibly presaging a
sharp slowdown in growth or even a recession.  (See box Financial indicators of
recession risk.)  The Committee may be concerned that the housing correction could
be more severe than anticipated by the staff, as explored in the Greater housing
correction alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  Members may also worry that a
serious credit crunch could be emerging with economic consequences of the sort
explored in the Greenbook Bank capital crunch scenario.  If asset-backed
commercial paper programs draw even more heavily on bank backup liquidity lines
and banks come to hold a large volume of leveraged loans and mortgages on their
balance sheets, banks may tighten terms and standards for lending to households and
businesses in order to conserve liquidity and balance sheet capacity.  Continued
market volatility or the emergence of news of losses could lead to solvency concerns
about one or more major market participants, which would likely worsen counterparty
credit concerns and interbank funding problems.  The Committee may consider these
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 27 of 49
Financial Indicators of Recession Risk 
 
Some financial market observers consider the slope of the 
Treasury yield curve to be a useful predictor of future 
macroeconomic conditions.  The yield curve had been inverted 
or flat until June and recently has steepened somewhat; thus, by 
that measure, the risk of recession appears to have diminished in 
recent months.  However, spreads between corporate yields and 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields also have had considerable 
statistical power in predicting recent recessions.  Some of those 
credit spreads have surged over the past month to levels 
comparable to those reached in 1989 and 2000.  Thus, markets 
may be signaling high odds of imminent macroeconomic 
deterioration, despite the steepening of the Treasury yield curve. 
 
Combining term and credit spreads in a logistic regression 
produces a model that performs well in predicting the last two 
recessions one year ahead while at the same time minimizing the 
number of false positivesthat is, predictions of recessions that 
did not occur.  Different measures of term and credit spreads 
produce slightly different results in this model, but a good fit is 
achievedover the 1988 through 2006 estimation periodby 
using the spread on AA-rated five-year corporate bonds and the 
difference between ten- and two-year Treasury yields.1  The 
August 2007 average values of these variables suggest a 
probability of about 40 percent that the U.S. economy will be in 
a recession in August 2008.  This is the largest probability that 
the model has produced since late 2000, and it is up from 
virtually zero earlier in the year.  If spreads during the first part 
of September were to persist for the remainder of the month, 
the estimated probability would rise to over 80 percent. 
 
The apparently heightened risk of recession is notable, but some 
caveats are in order.  In particular, given the rather 
unprecedented nature of recent developments, it is possible that 
the term and credit spreads currently reflect different factors 
than they did prior to the previous two recessions.  Moreover, 
the AA spread has risen more dramatically than some other 
credit spreads in recent weeks.  For example, high-yield bond 
spreads remained near their historical averages and thus 
continued to suggest less than 10 percent odds of a recession as 
of August.  Although high-yield spreads have not previously 
performed as well in predicting business cycles as AA spreads, 
the sensitivity of the prediction to which credit spread is used 
indicates that the recent readings should be interpreted with care. 
 
 
1 Specifically, these two variables forecast recent recessions and expansions at 
least as well as alternative measures of term and credit spreads, based on both 
in- and out-of-sample tests.  See King, T. B.; Levin, A. T; and Perli, R., 
Financial Market Perceptions of Recession Risk.  Working paper, July 2007.

risks sufficiently palpable to warrant a downward tilt to the balance of risks even after
a half-point rate cut.
","Alternative A"
2007-10-30,23,"(23) The proposed statement for Alternative C indicates that economic growth
was solid in the third quarter despite the ongoing housing correction.  It then notes
the easing in financial market strains and associates that development with a reduction
in the downside risks to growth.  The statement proceeds to affirm the expectation
that the pace of economic expansion will slow in the near term but also that the
substantial easing of monetary policy in September should help promote moderate
growth over time.  The statement makes no explicit mention of potential risks
induced by tighter credit conditions.  The wording on inflation begins by noting the
improvement in inflation readings this year, as in the September FOMC statement,
but then cites the risk that the high level of resource utilization and recent increases in
energy prices may put renewed upward pressures on overall and core inflation.  The
Committee would indicate that the downside risks to growth are balanced by the
upside risks to inflation and would reintroduce the indication that future policy
adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.
Market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of no policy action
at this meeting and the statement proposed for Alternative C.  They would likely
conclude that the Committee has no inclination to lower rates in the near term.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 26 of 44
Given that high odds are placed on policy easing at this and coming meetings, both
short- and long-term interest rates would likely increase considerably following the
announcement.  In response to the jump in interest rates, the foreign exchange value
of the dollar might appreciate somewhat.  Although investors views about economic
prospects might be buoyed to some extent by an inference that the Federal Reserve
anticipated sustainable growth at the current level of the federal funds rate, it seems
more likely that market participants would mark down their expectations for
economic growth.  Consequently, concerns about credit risk could increase, and
equity prices could decline significantly.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2007-12-11,23,"(23) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to foster
sustainable growth and acceptable inflation over time, then it might be inclined to
choose Alternative C.  Members might read the incoming macroeconomic data as
broadly consistent with the outlook underlying its October policy decision, including
the expectation for a period of relatively slow growth late this year and early next year.
Conditions in short-term funding markets have deteriorated notably over the
intermeeting period and credit has tightened further for some households and
businesses, increasing the downside risks to growth.  However, the Committee might
feel that the adverse effects of such developments are likely to be limited and that its
earlier easing actionsand perhaps arrangement of swap lines with foreign central
banks and implementation of a Term Auction Facilityprovide ample insurance.
Moreover, members may be concerned that the unsettled state of financial markets
may make it difficult for Committee to quickly reverse further policy easing, even if
the prospects for economic growth improve.  And, although core inflation has stayed
moderate and the baseline outlook for inflation may be viewed as acceptable,
members may view elevated oil and other commodity prices and a weaker dollar as
posing large enough upside risks to inflation to make an immediate reduction in the
target funds rate problematic.  Under these circumstances, the Committee might see
maintenance of the current stance of policy for now as appropriate but judge that
downside risks to growth have become the dominant concern.  Such an approach
would leave the Committee well placed to see whether financial market strains
diminish significantly after year-end and to accumulate additional information on the
outlook for growth and inflation before deciding whether further policy easing should
be implemented.

would appropriately balance the risks to its dual objectives of fostering maximum
employment and price stability, it may wish to reduce the target federal funds rate
by 25 basis points, as in Alternative B, a relatively modest action compared with
those taken over the past several months.  Members may view the incoming data
as broadly consistent with their earlier assessments concerning the underlying
weakness of economic activity and the likely need for further monetary stimulus at
this meeting to promote a timely resumption of moderate economic growth.

assess the effects of the policy actions 
taken to date.  However, the 
Committee remains prepared to act as 
needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability.
The Committee judges that downside 
risks to growth remain but concluded 
that more time is needed to better 
assess economic prospects and the 
effects of the policy actions taken to 
date.  The Committee will act in a 
timely manner as needed to promote 
sustainable economic growth and price 
stability.

Indeed, the Greenbook-consistent measure of the equilibrium funds rate is about
½ percentage point below the Bluebook estimate of the current real funds rate,
suggesting that policy likely still needs to be eased fairly significantly in order to
bring output back to its potential over the medium term.  However, the
Committee may view the calibration of the appropriate level of the funds rate as
particularly problematic given the difficulty of assessing the effects of the
substantial easing of policy to date and the myriad uncertainties surrounding the
outlook for output and inflation.  In light of this difficulty and with the gap
between the real federal funds rate and its equilibrium rate now estimated to have
narrowed, members may prefer to adjust policy more gradually than hitherto.  The
deterioration in the near-term outlook for inflation over recent months may also
be viewed as supporting the adoption of a more incremental approach.  In
particular, members might be concerned that a more aggressive policy easing at
this meeting would encourage a perception that the Committee has a greater
tolerance for inflation than previously thought, with the potential for adverse
effects on longer-term inflation expectations.  Members might also worry that
another substantial reduction in the funds rate would increase the likelihood of a
steep decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar or possibly even a further
run-up in commodity prices, developments that would put additional upward
pressure on inflation.

Recent information indicates that 
economic activity has remained weak in 
recent months.  Although consumer 
spending appears to have firmed 
somewhat, residential investment has 
continued to contract sharply and labor 
markets have softened further. Financial 
markets remain under considerable stress, 
and tight credit conditions and the 
deepening housing contraction are likely 
to weigh on economic growth over the 
next few quarters.
Recent information indicates that overall 
economic activity continues to expand, partly

Rationale 3. Although readings on core inflation 
have improved somewhat, energy and 
other commodity prices have increased, 
and some indicators of inflation 
expectations have risen in recent months. 
The Committee expects inflation to 
moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a 
projected leveling-out of energy and other 
commodity prices and an easing of 
pressures on resource utilization. Still, 
uncertainty about the inflation outlook 
remains high. It will be necessary to 
continue to monitor inflation 
developments carefully.
Although energy prices have increased 
further and some indicators of inflation 
expectations have risen in recent months, 
core inflation has been stable of late. The

an easing of pressures on resource 
utilization. Still, uncertainty about the 
inflation outlook remains high. It will be

developments carefully.
The Committee expects inflation to

However, in light of the continued increases 
in the prices of energy and some other

remains high.
Overall inflation has been elevated, energy 
prices have continued to increase, and some 
indicators of inflation expectations have 
risen further.  The Committee expects 
inflation to moderate later this year and next 
year, partly reflecting todays policy action.  
Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook 
remains high. It will be necessary to 
continue to monitor inflation developments 
carefully.
Assessment 
of Risk
The substantial easing of monetary policy 
to date, combined with ongoing measures 
to foster market liquidity, should help to 
promote moderate growth over time and 
to mitigate risks to economic activity.  The 
Committee will continue to monitor 
economic and financial developments and 
will act as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability.
The substantial easing of monetary policy to

Although downside risks to growth remain, 
they appear to have diminished somewhat, 
and the upside risks to near-term inflation 
and inflation expectations have increased.  
The Committee will continue to monitor 
economic and financial developments and 
will act as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability.
Future policy adjustments will depend on 
the evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as implied 
by incoming information on the economy 
and financial conditions.

view of the recent household and business spending data, as well as some
incremental improvement in financial conditions over the intermeeting period, the
Committee may now believe that the real federal funds rate is near its equilibrium
level.  Indeed, the real federal funds rate based on lagged four-quarter core PCE
inflation is now very close to its Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value (Chart 6).
Thus, although the current level of inflation may be seen as somewhat elevated
relative to the Committees longer-run objectives, members may judge that the
current stance of policy is consistent with a modal outlook for a gradual closing of
the output gap and modest downward pressure on core inflation over the next few
years.  If members anticipate that the factors that are currently restraining
economic growth will gradually dissipate going forward, then they may believe that
policy ought to remain on hold for a while, before gradually beginning to firm.
Indeed, the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 2 percent, shown
in Chart 7, prescribes a trajectory for the target funds rate that hovers around the
current target for the next year or so and subsequently rises.  These considerations
might argue for an unchanged stance of policy for the time being, coupled with a
statement that suggests that policy is more likely to firm going forward than to
ease.  Members may also see the current constellation of risks as suggesting that
policy should stand pat for now.  Although recent developments imply some
diminution in the risk of an adverse feedback loop between financial markets and
the real economy, downside risks to growth persist:  Housing markets remain very
weak, labor markets have deteriorated further, and record energy prices are likely
to weigh on consumer sentiment and overall growth.  On the other hand, inflation
risks appear to have increased:  Rising energy prices and somewhat less resource
slack than had been expected may be seen as adding to inflationary pressures, and
many indicators of inflation expectations have drifted up this yeara trend that has
continued to some extent since the last FOMC meeting.  With these crosscurrents,

the Committee may view the current degree of monetary policy accommodation as
appropriate and wish to allow time for more information to accumulate before
adjusting the stance of policy in either direction.

2008-09-16,23,"(23) If the Committee views the staff forecast, which is conditioned on
unchanged policy through the middle of next year, as reasonable and acceptable in the
circumstances and sees no compelling reason to change the statement materially, it
may wish to leave the policy rate unchanged and issue a statement along the lines of
that in Alternative B.  Although inflation is currently high, the Committee may
expect inflation to decline to acceptable levels given the recent appreciation of the
dollar, the decline in oil prices, and the outlook for persistent economic slack.  And
even though members may believe that the next policy move is likely to be a
tightening, they may also judge that holding the funds rate steady for now is
appropriate given the Committees dual objectives.  Indeed, the optimal policy
simulations based on a 1½ percent inflation goal has the target federal funds rate just

Incoming information suggests that

a bit above its current level until the second half of 2010 (Chart 7).  Moreover, the
risks to the outlook remain considerable on both sides.  Financial strains have
continued over the intermeeting period, and, while business spending has held up, the
recent indications of exceptionally low consumer confidence, sharply declining auto
sales, and deteriorating labor market conditions may suggest continued significant
downside risks to growth.  At the same time, inflation has persisted at levels well
above those consistent with price stability, and the Committee may remain very
concerned that inflation will not moderate as forecast.  In these circumstances, the
Committee may consider it prudent to leave policy unchanged while waiting for more
information bearing on the outlook for economic activity and inflation.

1970-06-23,24,"(24) Given the known pitfalls in projecting financial data,
the differences in implications of the three alternative directives
may not seem very significant. However, some possibility exists that
the changes in short-term market interest rates required under
Alternative B or C could be large enough to have appreciable effects
on market expectations about the course of interest rates. Thus,
the adoption of Alternative C might lead to a decline in short-term
market rates sufficient to make large CD's marginally competitive
again. If this were to happen, banks would be able to strengthen
their liquidity positions somewhat; and the resulting lessening of
tensions could improve market expectations regarding credit availability
and interest rates. On the other hand, given the still sensitive state
of securities markets, the adoption of Alternative B, involving a
marginal firming in money markets, might lead to some stiffening of
market interest rates and renewed apprehensions about financial

1980-01-08,24,"(24) The more modest money growth over the next few months under
alternative B provides more scope for expansion in M-1 in the second half
of 1980 than does alternative A. Moreover, the smaller reduction of interest
rates, as compared with alternative A, would provide less stimulus to nominal
GNP and money demand later this year. Thus, under this alternative interest
rates may drift downward through summer under longer-run alternative I,
shown in the second column of appendix C. However, under the more restrictive
longer-run policy of alternative II, interest rates would probably begin
rising by spring as the quantity of money demanded tended to expand more
rapidly than the supply that would be provided consistent with the 4½ percent
midpoint of the alternative II path.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative A"
1981-07-06,24,"(24) Even under alternatives A or B, the earnings problems
of thrift institutions would remain intense, although they obviously would
be greatest with the higher interest rates implied by alternative C.
The liberalization of deposit rate ceilings tentatively set by the DIDC
to take effect in August should bolster thrift deposit flows; the degree
is impossible to anticipate with any precision at this point, especially
because there will be unconstrained bank-thrift competition in the 4-year-
and-over time deposit category. But earnings pressures on the thrifts
would be at best relieved only a little, and concerns that liquidity diffi-
culties may emerge as a result of such pressures will encourage the
thrifts to maintain cautious mortgage lending postures.
Directive Language
(24) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the
directive consistent with the form of the directives adopted at recent
meetings. The specifications adopted at the meeting on May 18 are
shown in strike-through form.
In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates consistent with [DEL: a substantial deceleration of] growth
in M-1B from [DEL: April to] June to SEPTEMBER AT an annual rate of [DEL: 3] ____
percent [DEL: or lower,] after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW
accounts, and with growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about [DEL: 6] ____
percent. [DEL: The shortfall in growth of M-1B from the two month
rate specified above would be acceptable, in light of the rapid
growth in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on
March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5½
percent or somewhat less.] It is recognized that shifts into NOW
accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an
unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be
developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. The
Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the
Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary
objectives and related reserve paths during the period before
the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds
rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 16 to 22] ____ TO ____
","alternative C"
1983-02-08,24,"(24) Alternative C, which appears most consistent with the
tightest of the longer-run alternatives presented, involves a rise in the
federal funds rate to the 9 percent area. Interest rates would adjust
sharply upward, particularly so over the short run in the Treasury note
and bond area where the market is in process of digesting a substantial
refunding. Private rates would also rise, and a portion of the recent
improvement in quality spreads may be reversed, as concerns about the
viability of major borrowers tend to re-emerge. Borrowing at the dis-
count window, given the present discount rate, would probably rise to
around $500 million, and nonborrowed reserves would contract by about
exchange markets over the short run.
","Alternative C"
1984-07-16,24,"(25) Alternative C contemplates a very considerable decelera-
tion in M1 growth-as more consistent with growth around the midpoint
of its longer-run range over the year as a whole-and greater restraint
on growth of the broader money and credit aggregates. The 4 percent annual
rate of growth in M1 from June to September would bring expansion of this
aggregate from QIV '83 to September to 6-1/2 percent at an annual rate.
Growth at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate from September to December would
be needed to hit 6 percent for the year as a whole.
","Alternative C"
1985-02-12,24,"(24) Other interest rates would also be expected to rise
substantially under alternative C, with the Treasury bill rate increasing
to around 8-3/4 percent. Long-term rates are also likely to advance
significantly in the short run. Upward pressures on the dollar on foreign
exchange markets would intensify, and U.S. trading partners also would
be under pressure to raise short-term rates.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1985-07-09,24,"(24) Unchanged reserve and money market conditions, as under
alternative B, are likely to be associated with a modest back-up in short-
term interest rates as the summer progresses, given fairly widespread
expectations of some easing of Federal Reserve policy over coming months.
The 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise to around 7-1/4 percent. Bond
yields, although increasing a bit initially in sympathy with short-term
rates, might change relatively little on balance, since long-term rates
are high in real terms and relative to short-term rates. Some upward
movement in long-term rates may develop, however, should there be sub-

In foreign exchange markets, the dollar is expected to remain within
the trading range prevailing in the last few months.
","alternative B"
1986-02-11,24,"(24) Alternative C encompasses a modest firming in reserve condi-
tions, with discount borrowing increasing to $450 to $500 million and federal
funds trading consistently somewhat above 8 percent. The tightening assumed
under this alternative would come as something of a surprise to participants
in foreign as well as domestic markets. Short-term rates would back up
appreciably, and the exchange value of the dollar would partly reverse some
of its recent decline. Long-term rates would also rise, at least in the
short-run, particularly if the current Treasury refunding were not well
","Alternative C"
1986-07-08,24,"(24) Alternative C contemplates a tightening of reserve condi-
tions and a more sizable slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates
from their pace of recent months. M1 growth over June to September, at 6
percent, would be restrained to only about one-third of its March-to-June
pace, cutting into sane of the present overshoot of this aggregate relative
to the upper bound of its current annual range. Both M2 and M3 would
grow more slowly over the next three months than the midpoint of their
ranges for the year, and the levels of these broader aggregates would
edge a bit below the middle of their ranges by September. Discount
window borrowing would rise to around $500 million, with the federal
funds rate backing up into the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent area.
","Alternative C"
1987-02-10,24,"(24) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with a
borrowing level of $500 million, which would likely lead to a rise in the
federal funds rate to the 6-1/2 percent area. Such a policy move would
exert greater restraint on M2, bringing this aggregate well within even the
alternative III range. A relatively large widening of opportunity costs of
liquid retail accounts would act to damp expansion of M2 while reduced asset
growth at banks and thrifts would limit issuance of managed liabilities in
M3. Tighter reserve conditions also would raise the odds that M1 growth
would decelerate substantially in the months ahead.
","alternative C"
1989-07-05,24,"(24) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented below.
Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade in the 9-1/2 to
tions, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing would be expected to average
$650 million over the coming intermeeting period, up from the present $500
million assumption. That adjustment is suggested in light of recent
experience; seasonal borrowing rose to $500 million near the end of the
last maintenance period and is likely to increase somewhat further over
the coming intermeeting period. Under alternative C, funds would trade
around 10 percent or a bit higher with borrowings of $850 million. The
easing of policy under alternative A might be associated with less than
the usual $200 million reduction in borrowing. Since adjustment borrowing
is close to frictional levels it is not likely to decline much in response
to decreases in the spread, and seasonal borrowing has a fairly low
interest sensitivity. As a consequence, the staff estimates that a funds
rate in the 9 to 9-1/8 percent area under alternative A would be consis-
tent with borrowing of perhaps around $550 million. In any event, the
rather high degree of uncertainty about the borrowing relationship sug-
gests that the Desk again should pursue the borrowing objective flexibly.
","alternative B, alternative C, alternative A, alternative A"
1990-02-06,24,"(24) Under alternative B, M3 would grow at a 3-1/2 percent rate
from December to March. Thrift assets continue to run off rapidly. Bank
credit expansion, though picking up a little, is expected to remain moder-
ate, and bank issuance of managed liabilities to continue subdued in the
face of stronger core deposit growth. Inflows to institution-only money
market mutual funds should pause after the bulge in January, as their
yields move down into more normal alignment with market rates. Overall
debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at an 8 percent
rate from December to March, placing this aggregate a bit below the mid-
point of its 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent tentative monitoring range. In the
federal sector, borrowing quickens over the balance of the quarter, while
the average growth of the overall debt of the other sectors should about
maintain the estimated January pace.
","alternative B"
1991-02-05,24,"(24) While money growth will continue to be damped by the
restructuring of depository institutions, the staff expects the lower
market interest rates and opportunity costs of recent months to begin
providing some lift to monetary growth in the near term. Some hints of a
pickup of M2 were already in evidence in January, and an acceleration to
an average pace of about 4-1/2 percent over February and March would be
expected under alternative B. Under the lower money market rates of al-
ternative A, the acceleration would be even greater, to 5-1/2 percent over
the two months. To a large degree, the greater flows into M2 would be
direct toward money market funds, as investors likely will continue to
look askance at depository institutions and the institutions themselves
continue to post relatively unattractive rates. Alternative B would leave

M2 in March only a little above the lower bound of its 2-1/2 to 6-1/2
percent provisional target range. However, given the lags between changes
in interest rates and money demand, the effects of the recent policy eas-
ings still would be boosting money growth through the second quarter,
bringing M2 closer to the middle of its provisional range by June. Under
alternative A, M2 still would be in the lower portion of its range by
March, but would be on a trajectory to move around the midpoint by June.

1991-07-02,24,"(24) Three near-term alternatives for monetary policy are pre-
sented below for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal
funds would continue to trade around 5-3/4 percent. Initially, the al-
lowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing would remain at $325 mil-
lion.8  Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to
around 5-1/4 percent. This reduction could be accomplished either by
providing nonborrowed reserves sufficient for adjustment and seasonal
borrowing to decline to about $275 million or by cutting the discount rate
by 1/2 percentage point from its current level of 5-1/2 percent.9 Alter-
native C incorporates a funds rate of 6-1/4 percent and borrowing of about
$375 million. Growth rates for the monetary aggregates projected to ac-
company the three alternatives are shown in the table below. More detail-
ed data are presented in the tables and charts on the following pages.

With the funds rate around or perhaps a little below most assessments
of the underlying inflation rate, market participants might see such a
policy move as unsustainable, thereby limiting the decline in bond
rates. The greater prospects for calls on corporate bonds and prepay-
ments on mortgages would tend to widen spreads on such instruments
relative to Treasury yields. The exchange value of the dollar would
fall under this alternative as U.S. money market interest rates drop-
ped still further below those of our major trading partners.

would remain below the lower bounds of their current ranges. Even
under alternative A, M2 would be on a trajectory that would bring it
closer to, though still a bit below, its lower bound in the fourth
quarter, and M3 also would be expected to remain somewhat below its
current range through year-end. The response of M2 under alternatives A

embodied in demand for this aggregate, partly as a consequence of
heightened depositor sensitivity to the slope of the yield curve.

1993-07-06,24,"(24) Three policy alternatives are given below for Committee
consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would remain in a
trading range around 3 percent, in association with an initial allowance
for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million, an increase of
$50 million from the current allowance to accommodate the normal pattern
in seasonal borrowing at this time of the year. Under alternative A,
the funds rate would be reduced to the area of 2-1/2 percent, either by
choosing a $225 million borrowing allowance or by cutting the discount
rate 1/2 percentage point, to 2-1/2 percent, while retaining a $250
million borrowing allowance. Under alternative C, which could be imple-
mented through a $275 million borrowing allowance, the funds rate would
vary around 3-1/2 percent.
","alternative B, alternative A, alternative C"
1994-02-03,24,"(24) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Com-
mittee consideration. Alternative B involves a continuation of feder-
al funds trading around 3 percent and of adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing averaging initially about $50 million.12  Under alterna-
tive C, the federal funds rate would increase to around 3-1/2 percent
in association with a rise in the borrowing allowance to $75 million.
Alternative A embodies a downward adjustment of the federal funds rate
to 2-1/2 percent and of the borrowing allowance to $25 million.
","Alternative B, Alternative A"
1996-01-30,24,"(24) The staff outlook appears to be more buoyant than that
of market participants, who evidently view the odds of a modest policy
easing at the upcoming meeting to be about even and expect appreciable
declines in the funds rate over coming months. Thus, rates could edge
higher under alternative B.16 However, the extent of any rise in
such rates likely would be tempered in the near term by the perception
that the Committee had merely postponed easing pending the availabi-
lity of more information. Over time, an economy and monetary policy
more consistent with the staff outlook than that of the market would
put additional upward pressure on rates. The dollar would be expected
to trade around recent higher levels on foreign exchange markets.
Markets are likely to continue to pay close attention to shifting
fiscal prospects, and if potential default on Treasury debt still
looms in late February, markets could become skittish, given that the
Treasury has indicated that its scope to maneuver to avoid default
will be exhausted by the beginning of March.
","alternative B"
1997-02-04,24,"(24) The tightening of policy under alternative C would surprise market participants,
and short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, would rise by the half-point hike in the
federal funds rate. In view of the shift in policy direction represented by such an action,
intermediate- and long-term rates could rise appreciably, especially if market participants
thought the Federal Reserve now saw significantly greater inflation risks than they had
inferred from recent statements by FOMC members. In this case, participants are more likely
to extrapolate some further tightening measures. Stock prices likely would come under
selling pressure, as monetary tightenings frequently have been associated with bear markets.
Nonetheless, even a significant backup in bond yields is unlikely to push them substantially
above the trading range of late spring and summer, which in turn has seemed to be
compatible with healthy economic growth. Moreover, the extraordinary rise in equity prices
over the last several months probably would not be wholly erased given recent strong
earnings news. The extent of the backup in nominal coupon yields might be contained were
the tightening to affect inflation expectations favorably by underscoring the Federal Reserve's
determination to forestall a pickup in inflation. The dollar would tend to rise on foreign
exchange markets from its elevated level of late, as the contrast between the cyclical positions
of the United States and many of its major trading partners was sharpened even further. Of
course, such declines in bond and stock prices and rise in the dollar would be important
channels through which the Committee would achieve its desired restraint on aggregate
demand growth.
","alternative C"
1998-02-03,24,"(24) Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw the economy as
continuing to operate beyond its potential, with the risk that sustained pressures on labor
markets might show through more forcefully than in the staff forecast to higher labor costs
and prices, perhaps hinted at in the recent employment cost report. Domestic spending
continues to be supported by very favorable conditions in debt and equity markets. The
decline in long-term rates should spur spending, in part as borrowers free cash flow by
refinancing higher cost debt. In this environment, counting on Asian developments to defuse
enough of the momentum in the economy may be viewed as too risky, especially as the
rebound in Asian stock markets and in commodity prices may suggest that limits to Asian
turmoil may be in sight. In response to the tightening, short-term rates would rise by at least
the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Intermediate- and long-term yields
would also rise, although market participants are unlikely to build in much further tightening
in light of the situation in Asia, thereby constraining the extent of the increase. Stocks would
come under some selling pressure, accentuated perhaps by the uncertainty precipitated by such
a surprise in policy. The dollar would tend to rise on foreign exchange markets.
","Alternative C"
1998-06-30,24,"(24) The Committee might favor the quarter-point tightening of alternative C if it
viewed the updrift in underlying inflation in the staff forecast as unacceptable. Indeed, the
Committee may view the recent upside surprises in core consumer price inflation, coupled
with the persistently low level of the unemployment rate, as implying that inflation may
advance to even higher rates than the staff has built into its forecast. That risk would be
exacerbated if the staff has overestimated the extent of the coming slowdown in spending
growth, considering still-accommodative conditions in financial markets, as well as the ability
of the economy to expand without intensifying pressures on prices. In that environment,
putting off policy action in deference to uncertain conditions in foreign markets may pose too
great a risk to the continued good performance of the U.S. economy, and the longer-term
health of the global economy itself, particularly as a quick resolution to the problems abroad
is probably not in the cards. Given the current high levels of resource utilization, the
Committee might believe that delay would only raise the odds that greater, probably more
wrenching, policy tightening will be required later.
","alternative C"
1999-02-02,24,"(24) In view of the strength of recent economic activity, investors might be puzzled by
implementation of alternative A, but they likely would conclude that the shift represented another
small, and perhaps final, adjustment of policy to turbulence abroad designed to ensure that U.S.
economic growth remained robust. Short-term market rates would decline noticeably, but bond
yields and spreads would probably fall only a bit. The foreign exchange value of the dollar likely
would weaken, and equity prices could ascend further.
","alternative A"
1999-06-29,24,"(24) The Committee might choose the 25 basis-point increase in the federal funds
rate under alternative C if it agreed with the staffs forecast that the risks were decidedly on
the side of an upward tilt to inflation and wished to take preemptive action now. Although
inflation remains subdued, as yet signs that economic expansion will moderate to a pace that
will avoid added strains in labor markets are tentative. With foreign economies continuing
to recover and the real federal funds rate appreciably below its level of a year ago, the
Committee may desire some added assurance that the economy will slow to trend.
Validating at least the initial step of the sequence of expected policy moves now embedded
in financial prices would help to preserve the recent firming in financial conditions.
Grounds for tightening would be even stronger if the Committee saw, as the staff does, the
unchanged unemployment rate in the Greenbook forecast as too low to forestall an upward
trend in inflation. The Committee, in this case, might even want to consider a 50 basis
point firming; in the extended baseline strategy, a 150 basis point tightening over the next
three years is needed to cap PCE inflation at 2-1/2 percent.
","alternative C"
2006-10-24,24,"(24) If the Committee expected higher inflation than the staff, or if it thought
the Greenbook forecast was broadly plausible but viewed inflation as remaining
unacceptably high, it might wish to raise the target federal funds rate to 5½ percent at
this meeting, as in Alternative C.  This alternative might be favored if the factors
underlying the increase in core inflation in the first half of this year were viewed as
likely to be more persistent than envisaged in the staffs projection, perhaps reflecting
an increase in inflation expectations as illustrated in the Higher expected inflation
simulation presented in the Greenbook.  In that regard, the Committee may be
concerned that the current level of inflation expectations is already somewhat higher
than the objectives cited by a number of policymakers.  (The box on the following
page discusses various measures of inflation expectations.)  Even if the Committee
shares the staffs view that inflation is likely to decline gradually over the forecast, it
may view the pace of that decline, in which core PCE inflation is projected to remain

fall Estimates of inflation expectations 
 
The level of inflation expectations is a key factor affecting monetary policy.  Estimates of 
such expectations can potentially be gleaned from surveys and financial asset prices.  But 
given various technical and measurement issues, these indicators do not typically provide a 
clean read of investors expectations of core inflation.  
 
The difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and those on TIPS contains 
information about investors inflation expectations.  However, a number of adjustments are 
necessary to translate the raw spread between nominal and real yields into an estimate of 
core PCE inflation expectations:
 First, the raw spread includes a liquidity premium.  Although the liquidity premium in 
TIPS is estimated to have declined notably over time, and by some recent 
calculations now stands very close to zero, this issue somewhat complicates any 
reading of inflation expectations.
 Second, TIPS compensate investors for inflation with a two-and-a-half month lag, 
and hence raw prices partially reflect inflation that has already occurred.  Adjustments 
for these carry effects are straightforward but imprecise.
 Third, TIPS payments are based on the non-seasonally-adjusted headline CPI, not 
the core PCE.  The staffs forecasts of these two series can be used to translate 
between price indexes under the assumption that financial markets have a similar 
assessment.
 Fourth, the raw spread includes an inflation risk premium.  To separate inflation risk 
premiums from expected inflation, Board staff employs a number of methods based 
on affine term structure models that are necessarily model dependent.
After considering these adjustments and based on the most recently observed differences 
between yields on nominal Treasury securities and TIPS, the staffs point estimates of 
expected core PCE inflation from the very near term to ten years ahead vary between about 
2.0 and 2.4 percent.  However, the caveats associated with these adjustments suggest 
substantial confidence intervals around these point estimates. 
 
The Desks recent survey includes primary dealers forecasts of quarterly core PCE price 
inflation from the current quarter through the first quarter of 2008, and the average 
projection across that horizon also ranged from about 2.0 percent to 2.4 percent.  The 
monthly Michigan Survey does not refer to a specific price index, but regressions can be 
used to infer anticipated core PCE inflation from the survey responses.  The most recent 
reading of 2.9 percent over the next twelve months implies expected core PCE inflation of 
approximately 2.6 percent over the same period.  Unfortunately, limited data preclude a 
similar mapping for longer-run expectations.  Finally, assuming the staffs presumed 
discrepancy between headline CPI and core PCE, inflation expectations for 2007 and over 
the next ten years from the August Survey of Professional Forecasters are about 2.4 and 
2.1 percent, respectively.

above 2 percent beyond 2008, as unacceptably slow.  In the medium-term strategies
presented earlier, for example, bringing inflation below 2 percent in the next few years
involves raising the federal funds rate to about 6 percent over the next several
","Alternative C"
2007-03-20,24,"(24) The rationale for Alternative C could indicate the Committees
fundamentally unchanged outlook for growth by stating that the economy appears to
be expanding at a moderate pace and likely will continue to do so in coming quarters,
supported by solid growth in consumer spending without mentioning areas of
weakness.  The rationale could emphasize the Committees discomfort with inflation
by stating not only that core inflation remains somewhat elevated, but also that
considerable uncertainty surrounds the judgment that inflation will moderate and
that the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation
pressures.  If the Committee wished to make clear that the 25 basis point increase in
the funds rate did not entirely assuage its concern about inflation risks, the Committee
could replace the first sentence of Januarys assessment of risk with language stating
that the Committees predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will
fail to moderate as expected while retaining the second sentence.
","Alternative C"
2007-06-27,24,"(24) The statement in Alternative A would continue to note that the economy
seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace.  But the Committee may perceive the
downside risk to that forecast emanating from the housing sector as being greater
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 42
than it was in May, owing to the backup in mortgage interest rates.  Accordingly, the
draft language highlights this risk by placing it in a separate sentence at the end of the
second paragraph and by pointing explicitly to ongoing weakness in the housing
sector rather than ongoing adjustment.  In the inflation paragraph, the reference to
core inflation being elevated would be deleted and replaced by the assessment that
core inflation has edged lower and is likely to remain moderate, implicitly placing
considerable weight on the recent inflation news.  The statement could conclude by
noting that even after the 25 basis point easing, the downside risk to the Committees
growth objective is roughly offset by the upside risk to its inflation objective, and that
future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth.
","Alternative A"
2007-08-07,24,"(24) Even if the Committee does not believe that a policy easing is warranted at
this meeting, it might judge, in light of the further weakening of the housing sector
and the recent deterioration in financial conditions, that downside risks to growth
have increased appreciably.  And given the continued subdued readings on core
inflation and moderate wage growth, the Committee might also see the upside risks to
inflation as having diminished slightly in recent weeks.  If the Committee judges that
the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are now roughly
balanced, it might wish to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting but
release a statement that combines the Alternative A language on real activity (A.2)
with the Alternative B language on inflation (B.3) and the balanced risk assessment of
Alternative A (A.4)of course, it would be necessary to drop the phrase, After this
action.  Investors likely would conclude from such a statement that the Federal
Reserve now sees significant downside risks to growth and is preparing to ease.
Yields on Treasury securities likely would decline.  If investors found the prospect of
an early easing reassuring, credit spreads could narrow and equity prices could rise.
But credit spreads could widen and equity prices could fall if the statements explicit
recognition of downside risks to growth were to make investors more worried about
the outlook.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative A"
2007-09-18,24,"(24) The draft statement for Alternative A is similar to that for Alternative B,
but with four main differences.  First, the reference to economic growth having been
moderate in the first half of the year is deleted, as this may be seen as no longer
relevant to the outlook, given the abrupt shift in circumstances.  Second, Alternative
A states that credit conditions and the housing correction appear likely to exert
appreciable restraint on growth, which is stronger than the statement that they have
the potential  . . .  to restrain economic growth.  Third, in addition to giving a more
gloomy modal assessment of the growth outlook, the draft language also cites the
potential for significant financial spillovers to business and household spending as
posing downside risks to that outlook.  Finally, the draft for Alternative A is explicit
that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative
A, Alternative A"
2007-10-30,24,"(24) While strains in financial markets have eased in recent weeks, functioning in
some markets remains impaired.  Moreover, banks appear to have responded to the
problems in funding markets, concerns about balance sheet capacity, and worries
about the economic outlook by tightening terms and standards across a broad range
of credit products.   The Committee might see these developments as reducing its
modal outlook for aggregate demand relative to its expectations after its September
action.  Alternatively, members might see the failure of credit market conditions to
improve more significantly and incoming evidence of a steepening contraction in the
housing sector as indicating that the downside risks to overall economic performance
remain unacceptably large; the potential implications of such factors are illustrated in
the Greater Fallout from Financial Stress alternative scenario in the Greenbook.
Either view might incline the Committee to choose Alternative A, which lowers the
target federal funds rate 25 basis points.  The Committee might see easing policy
another notch as an appropriate risk-management tactic, given the potential for
particularly adverse outcomes, especially since a 25 basis point cut in the target federal
funds rate would still be consistent with several policy rules (Chart 7).  Given that
inflation data have continued to be favorable, the Committee may also believe that a
policy easing would be consistent with its price stability objectives, especially if
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 27 of 44
members believe that, if necessary, they could act quickly in the future to reverse
some or all of the easing implemented since September.
","Alternative A"
2007-12-11,24,"(24) The proposed statement for Alternative C acknowledges that economic
growth appears to be slowing but indicates explicitly that the softening is broadly in
line with what the Committee had anticipated.  It then notes the increase in financial
market strains and acknowledges that they pose greater downside risk to growth, but
suggests that the monetary policy easing already in place is likely to promote moderate
expansion over time.  The wording on inflation closely follows the October
statement.  The draft statement then suggests that downside risks to growth are the
predominant concern and concludes with the language used in the August and earlier
statements that future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
","Alternative C"
2008-01-29,24,"(24) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative C is identical to that of
Alternatives A and B, but this alternative notes that upward pressure on inflation
could result from further increases in energy, commodity, and other import prices.
Moreover, in contrast to those two alternatives, the risk assessment in Alternative C
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 30 of 38
makes no reference to mitigating the risks to economic activity.  The remainder of
the risk assessment paragraph for this alternative is the same as in the January 22
FOMC statement, reiterating that appreciable downside risks to growth remain
and that the Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2008-04-29,24,"(24) The discussion of the outlook for economic activity and inflation in the
proposed statement accompanying Alternative B is little changed from the March
FOMC statement.  The characterization of the real economy has been amended to
contrast to the March statement in which the outlook for economic activity was
judged to have weakened further.  Similarly, in light of the mixed developments
in financial markets, credit conditions are described as tight as opposed to the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 38
tightening highlighted in March.  The paragraph about inflation is essentially
unaltered from the previous statement, save for some modest adjustments to the
references to the apparent rise in inflation expectations and to the increase in the
uncertainty attending the inflation outlook in order to avoid giving the impression
that either of these concerns has escalated over the intermeeting period.  Even
though the economic outlook has not changed materially, the draft risk assessment
appropriate to foster moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to
economic activity.  In contrast to the March statement, the risk assessment no
longer highlights the downside risks to growth and thus implies that policy has
moved to a more neutral stance.  The proposed risk assessment also indicates that
some time may be needed to better assess the effects of the policy actions taken
to date.  As such, the statement is likely to be interpreted as suggesting that policy
may be on hold for a while.  Nonetheless, the statement concludes by noting that
the Committee remains prepared to act as needed to promote economic growth
and price stability.
","Alternative B"
2008-06-24,24,"(24) The discussion of the growth outlook in the statement proposed for
Alternative B replaces the assessment in the April FOMC statement that economic
growth remains weak by noting instead that overall economic activity continues to
expand, and the firming in consumer spending data is cited as providing some
support to aggregate demand.  However, the discussion of the outlook for
economic activity retains some of the more downbeat language from the previous
statement, and adds the rise in energy prices to the list of factors that are seen as
likely to restrain growth going forward.  The housing contraction is described as
ongoing rather than deepening to avoid the suggestion that housing markets
are deteriorating more sharply than before.  Meanwhile, the inflation paragraph has
a more hawkish tone than in the April statement.  The observation that readings
on core inflation have improved somewhat is deleted in light of the fact that core
inflation readings moderated during the spring but have flattened out more
recently.  The statement suggests that inflation will moderate, but, unlike the
previous statement, omits discussion of the economic forces that might cause this
to occur.  Instead, the continued rise in energy and commodity prices and some
indications of heightened inflation expectations are cited as factors that have
increased the uncertainty about inflation prospects.  Although agricultural
commodity prices have increased further since the last FOMC meeting, other
commodity prices, including those of many metals, have declined markedly.
Accordingly, the draft language points to further increases in the prices of energy
and some other commodities.  The balance of risks assessment is unchanged from
April, except for the addition of a sentence that judges that there are downside
risks to growthwhich appear to have diminished somewhatand upside risks to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 32 of 41
near-term inflation and inflation expectations.  The two opposing risks are not
explicitly compared, but since the sentence ends on the discussion of upside risks
to inflation, markets may read it as suggesting that increased upside inflation risks
are now the greater policy concern of the Committee.
","Alternative B"
2008-09-16,24,"(24) In the statement under Alternative B, the rationale begins by noting that
Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent
months, which is changed from Economic activity expanded in the second quarter
to shift the discussion to the current quarter and reflect the significant, albeit
expected, deceleration that appears to be under way.  In light of the continued
deterioration in labor market conditions, the statement then indicates that labor
markets have weakened further, rather than softened as in August.  The
statement again notes that financial markets remain under considerable stress and
then states that Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, some
slowing in export growth, and past increases in energy prices are likely to weigh on
economic growth.  Some slowing in export growth is included to recognize that,
after surging about 11 percent over the four quarters ending in Q2, exports are
projected to decelerate to a rate more in line with historical norms, and past increases
in energy prices are referenced rather than elevated energy prices because the net
rise in energy prices over the past year or so continues to restrain growth despite the
recent marked decline in prices.  The remainder of the statement under Alternative B
is unchanged from that released by the Committee in August, indicating that the

substantial easing of monetary policy will promote economic growth; that the
Committee expects inflation to moderate, but the outlook is uncertain; and that,
although downside risks to growth remain, upside risks to inflation are also of
significant concern.
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
1980-01-08,25,"(25) Alternative C contemplates a rate of growth of M-1 of
about 4 percent in the first three months of 1980, which, given the
staff's GNP outlook, would probably involve little, if any, decline in
interest rates from current levels in that period. The funds rate may be
a bit below the 13 percent midpoint of the 11½ to 16 percent federal funds
rates specified for this alternative, with the 3-month bill rate around
and total reserves is likely to be about 7 and 1½ percent, respectively;
assuming borrowings of about $1¼ billion or a bit higher, nonborrowed
reserves might increase at about a 4 percent rate. Longer-term interest rates
probably would decline no more than modestly from current levels over the
next few weeks, as it became clear to market participants that, despite
relatively slow growth in M-1, very little ease was developing in money
market conditions. Alternative C would tend to help support the exchange
value of the dollar since it would be associated with maintenance of a
relatively high level of interest rates.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
1983-07-12,25,"(25) M1 growth could be expected to slow to about 6 percent
from June to September under this approach and, assuming the market pressures
of alternative B were maintained through year-end, to expand at a somewhat
slower pace in the final months of the year. If this occurred, M1 growth
for the year (QIV '82 to QIV '83) would be in the vicinity of 10½ percent.
M2 is expected to grow at an 8½ percent annual rate from June to September
under this alternative--which would bring this aggregate back toward the
midpoint of its longer-run range. While thrift deposit flows might be
about the same as under alternative A, higher deposit costs would once
again begin to eliminate the earnings of a large number of S&Ls and MSBs,
exerting upward pressure on mortgage rates.
","alternative B, alternative A"
1983-12-19,25,"(25) Under alternative C, growth in M2 would be constrained to
the lower half of its longer-run range. This would probably be associated
with M1 near the lower limit of its range, while M3 would be held comfortably
within the upper part of its range. Assuming M2 growth from November to March
of 7-1/4 percent and M1 growth of 5 percent, the tightening in money market
conditions expected under this alternative may involve discount window
borrowing rising to near $1 billion and the federal funds rate rising to 10
percent or a little above.
","alternative C"
1985-07-09,25,"(25) Alternative A contemplates an easing in money market
conditions consistent with somewhat more rapid money growth over the June-
to-September period. Borrowing at the discount window would drop to
minimal levels of around $150-200 million, or a more modest reduction in
borrowing might be accompanied by a cut in the discount rate to 7 percent.
The federal funds rate under this alternative would be expected to decline
toward 7 percent. Total and nonborrowed reserves would increase at 5-1/2
and 9-1/4 percent annual rates, respectively, over the summer. Other market
interest rates would fall relatively little under this alternative from
most recent levels-levels that appear to reflect anticipations of some
easing by the Federal Reserve over the near-term. The three-month bill
would probably trade in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent area. Private short-term
rates might decline more than bill rates as the lower overall level of
rates was seen as helping those financial institutions currently under
some stress. The dollar would decline in foreign exchange markets.
","Alternative A"
1987-02-10,25,"(25) The three-month bill rate would rise by about 50 basis points
under this alternative and other short-term rates would rise by a similar
amount, absent any accompanying greater concern about debt-servicing diffi-
culties of bank debtors. Downward pressure on the dollar would be relieved,
at least for a while, and the exchange value of the dollar could even
strengthen temporarily. Bond rates would back up, but the extent of any rise
would be tempered by reduced pressure on the dollar and sentiment that such a
firming measure would act to check inflationary pressure.
Directive language
","alternative a"
1987-07-07,25,"(25) Alternative A assumes a reduction in the borrowing allow-
ance to $300 million; the federal funds rate is likely to decline to the
comparable amounts, as there is very little expectation of a near-term
easing in monetary policy built into market rates. With an unwinding of
some of the rise over recent months in opportunity costs, M2 would move
closer to the lower end of its current longer-run range by September and,
given the lagged effect of the lower market rates and faster income growth,
would be likely to rise to just within this range in the fourth quarter.
The boost to M3 growth stemming from a small pickup in depository credit
expansion would lift this aggregate well into its current annual range.
","Alternative A"
1990-02-06,25,"(25) The policy easing embodied in alternative A, with the funds
rate moving to 7-3/4 percent, would induce a nearly comparable decline in
other short-term interest rates. The lowering of U.S. short-term rates
would cause a sharp downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of
the dollar. Nonetheless, some declines in bond rates are probable, as
investors scale down their forecasts of the intermediate-term path of
short rates. But the declines would be muted to the extent that the
policy easing and accompanying dollar depreciation were to intensify con-
cerns about future inflation pressures and the scope for further policy
easing. M2 demands would be boosted, to perhaps an 8-1/2 percent average
rate of growth over February and March, bringing December-to-March growth
to 7-1/2 percent and leaving M2 a bit above the 7 percent upper end of its
tentative range. M3 would rise at a 4 percent rate over the two months,
rapidly enough to engender a December-to-March growth rate of 3-3/4 per-
cent and place this aggregate a little above its 3-1/2 percent tentative
lower bound.
","alternative A"
1990-07-02,25,"(25) Under alternative A, the 1/2 percentage point drop in the
federal funds rate could be expected to show through nearly in full to
other money market rates, as market participants generally do not antici-
pate such an action in the period just ahead. This alternative also could
spark a bond market rally; given the market outlook for sluggish economic
activity, investors' inflation concerns probably would not be much inten-
sified by the choice of alternative A. The value of the dollar could be
expected to weaken on foreign exchange markets in response to the drop in
U.S. interest rates relative to returns abroad.
","alternative A, alternative a, alternative A"
1991-02-05,25,"(25) M3 would be expected to expand at a 3-3/4 percent pace over
the December-to-March period under alternative B and a little more under
alternative A. In both cases this would represent a considerable pickup
from its pace over the previous three months and would leave this aggre-
gate 3 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base, in the
middle of its 1 to 5 percent provisional range for 1991. The acceleration
mainly reflects greater flows to both M2- and M3-type money funds, given
the temporary boost in their returns relative to market rates. Bank
credit is projected to remain sluggish, increasing at only about a 2 per-
cent rate in the first three months of the year. Thrifts, in turn, are
expected to continue to shrink, though at a slower pace given constraints
on RTC resources. These constraints will hold down Federal debt growth
relative to late last year, and expansion of nonfederal debt is projected
to remain depressed. Overall, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors
should increase in the middle portion of its provisional 4-1/2 to 8-1/2
percent range.
Directive Language
","alternative B, alternative A"
1991-07-02,25,"(25) Under alternative B, market interest rates would probably
remain near their current levels. Market rates appear generally to incor-
porate a consensus view of no change in the stance of monetary policy over
the rest of the summer. Market participants, however, seem to expect the
economic rebound over the next few months to be weaker than presented in
the greenbook. If economic data turn out to be consistent with the green-
book, some upward pressure on interest rates could occur, though that
disadvantage of limiting the ability of the discount window to absorb
fluctuations in reserve supply and demand, thereby causing the funds
rate to become a little more volatile.

","alternative B"
1992-02-04,25,"(25) Even with a pickup over February and March, M2 would
expand at only a 3 percent annual rate over the December-to-March
period under alternative B, below the pace over the last three months
of 1991. All of the growth in M2 over coming months would come from
the 14-1/4 percent rate of expansion projected in its M1 compo-
nent. 1 1 Small denomination time deposits are seen as continuing to
run off rapidly over the remainder of the quarter. Recent aggressive
cuts in rates on liquid deposits, however, will tend to limit the
bulge in such accounts, deflecting some funds outside M2 as well as to
other M2 components. 12 Under the easier conditions of alternative
A, M2 would be expected to be expanding at a percentage point faster
pace in March and into the next quarter; all of the added growth in M2
would occur in M1, other liquid deposits, and M2 money funds.
","alternative B, alternative
A"
1992-06-30,25,"(25) While M2 under all three alternatives appears likely to
resume growth over the June-to-September period, under alternative B
this aggregate still is projected to grow at only a 2 percent annual
rate. The same forces that have been evident in recent years will
continue to depress the demand for broad money. Growth in M2 likely
will be damped additionally by runoffs of demand deposits associated
with the slowing in the pace of mortgage refinancing. Partly as a
result, M1 growth probably will be held down to a 6-1/2 percent annual

rate from June to September, about in line with its reduced March-to-
June pace. By contrast, the runoff of the non-M1 component of M2
is expected to come to an end, leaving its level about unchanged over
the June-to-September period. The declines in intermediate-term mar-
ket yields relative to rates on retail time deposits of comparable
maturity during the spring, as well as a prospective flattening of the
yield curve, should damp the shifting out of small time deposits.
","alternative B"
1993-02-02,25,"(25) Under alternative B, M2 would be about flat on average
over February and March. The rebound in March owes partly to the
narrowing of opportunity costs that has occurred recently. Holding
down this pickup will be diminished mortgage refinancing closings in
the period just ahead, reflecting the fall-off in applications late in

a 1-3/4 percent rate over February and March.) Still, M2 would remain
below its fourth-quarter 1992 level and, on a quarterly average basis,
would decline at a 1-1/4 percent pace in the first quarter, implying a
sharp 7-1/2 percent rate of increase in its velocity.
","alternative B"
1993-07-06,25,"(25) Although market participants believe that the next mone-
tary policy action is more likely to be a tightening than an easing,
they do not expect any move to occur over the coming intermeeting
period. Consequently, market interest rates would not respond initially
to the implementation of alternative B. Rates would tend to remain
near current levels or edge lower over subsequent weeks should data on
economic activity and prices prove to be about in line with the staff
projection and should the Congress continue to make progress on passage
of a deficit reduction package. Interest rates would back up across the
maturity spectrum, however, if adverse information on price pressures
generates expectations of a near-term tightening of monetary policy, or
if a major snag occurs in the process of deficit reduction. The
exchange value of the dollar is expected to fluctuate around recently
established levels; staff forecasts for continued monetary policy easing
abroad are broadly consistent with expectations already embedded in
interest and exchange rates.
","alternative B"
1994-02-03,25,"(25) Market participants now anticipate continuation of the
money market conditions implied by alternative B over the near term,
and FOMC choice of this alternative would not engender any immediate
reaction in security markets. Investors generally expect the Federal
Reserve to put off any policy tightening for a time, given
uncertainties about the extent of moderation in economic activity and
about developing price trends in early 1994--uncertainties that have
been heightened by the earthquake and severe weather. Nevertheless,
most anticipate a tightening within a few months as incoming data
suggest only a limited slowing in economic growth and a cessation of
disinflation. As the intermeeting period progresses, economic data
along the lines of the staff forecast might put modest upward pressure
on short-term interest rates as the time of expected tightening
approaches, but would induce little systematic movement in longer-term
rates. The exchange value of the dollar also is likely to trade in a
relatively narrow range around current levels.
","alternative B"
1995-01-31,25,"(25) Two policy alternatives are presented below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would
continue to trade around 5-1/2 percent, in association with keeping
the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at $75 million.
Under the tighter alternative C, the federal funds rate would be
raised 1/2 percentage point, to 6 percent, either by an equivalent
rise in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent with the same borrowing
allowance or by an increase in the borrowing allowance to $125 million
with the same discount rate.
","alternative B, alternative C"
1995-07-05,25,"(25) Two policy alternatives are presented below for Commit-
tee consideration. Under alternative B, the intended federal funds
rate would be maintained at 6 percent. Under the easier policy stance
of alternative A, the intended federal funds rate would be reduced by
","alternative B, alternative A"
1996-01-30,25,"(25) Justification for a quarter-point reduction in the
federal funds rate under alternative A would seem to rest on a belief
that the economy is weaker than in the staff outlook, as might be
inferred from the tone of some anecdotal reports and recent data, or
that the prospects for disinflation are brighter. In this regard, the
effects of the recently firmer dollar on spending and prices might be
seen as giving scope for some modest lowering of interest rates. An
easing in the next few months, although not necessarily at this meet-
ing, is consistent with expectations both of market participants, as
embodied in the yield curve, and, as suggested by the Blue Chip sur-
vey, of many outside forecasters whose inflation outlook on average
nonetheless does not differ significantly from the staff's.
","alternative A"
1997-02-04,25,"(25) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates is expected to slow under alternative B
from the very rapid pace of late 1996. Still, both M2 and M3 are projected to outpace
nominal income in the first few months of the year and to remain above the upper ends of
their provisional ranges for 1997 through March. M1, by contrast, is projected to run off in
the current quarter, owing to heavy sweep activity, but to expand moderately after adjusting
for sweeps. Growth of debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to run a little faster
in early 1997 than in late 1996, reflecting in part stronger business borrowing. Still, by
March this aggregate would be around the middle of its provisional range.

","alternative B"
1998-06-30,25,"(25) Tighter policy at this meeting, perhaps involving a move in the federal funds
rate to 5-3/4 percent as under alternative C, would catch domestic and international markets
unawares. Money market yields would rise at least as much as the federal funds rate, if not
more. Intermediate- and longer-term yields could rise substantially as well, particularly if
market participants viewed the Federal Reserve's willingness to tighten in the face of ongoing
turmoil in Asian and other emerging markets as evidence that U.S. domestic macroeconomic
imbalances were seen to be large and that further restraint might well be in store. By
contrast, if the market viewed the tightening as a limited mid-course correction--perhaps
guided by the wording of the press release announcing the action--the sell-off in capital
markets might be modest. In any event, equity prices would fall, as investors reconciled
themselves to both a higher rate on competing assets and a slower expansion of profits in the
future. Similarly, the dollar would tend to appreciate. If the action were not viewed as
presaging additional tightening in the United States and other industrial countries, the rise in
the dollar and pressure on foreign interest rates would be limited. With the exchange market
remaining skittish, large gains in the dollar against some currencies and further deterioration
in the financial markets of emerging market economies could not be ruled out.
","alternative C"
1999-02-02,25,"(25) In line with the staffs projections of annual growth of the monetary aggregates
that were discussed in the previous section, M2 and M3 are expected to slow somewhat over the
first several months of this year as the growth of nominal GDP moderates and the effects of
previous declines in interest rates abate. Under the unchanged funds rate of alternative B and the
economic conditions foreseen in the Greenbook, M2 is projected to expand at a 5-1/2 percent
pace and M3 at a 7-1/2 percent rate over the January-to-June period. Domestic nonfinancial
sector debt is expected to decelerate as well, growing at a 5-1/4 percent pace from December to
June and remaining near the middle of its provisional 3-to-7 percent annual range.
Directive Language
","alternative B"
1999-06-29,25,"(25) Although a 25 basis-point firming is built into prices, financial markets might
still react to a tightening move of this magnitude. The fluctuations in yields of the past few
weeks have demonstrated that financial markets are especially sensitive to perceptions of
Federal Reserve intentions, and the near-term reaction to alternative C will depend on the
market's interpretation of the announcement together with the choice of the tilt of the
directive. If the wording of the announcement suggested that the Committee was less
concerned about inflationary pressures than market participants have come to believe--and
therefore that the extent of policy firming in coming quarters might be less than now
anticipated--intermediate- and longer-term interest rates could decline some, perhaps
reversing a significant portion of the run-up over the past week. In this case, the dollar
could weaken some and equity markets could turn up. If, instead, the announcement
suggested serious concern about inflation risks, market participants could expect a more
rapid or protracted subsequent series of moves. In this case, interest rates and the foreign
exchange value of the dollar could rise a good bit, and stocks and emerging market debt
could come under selling pressure. While market talk that the Committee might tighten by
come as a considerable surprise. Price movements would likely be outsized, though a clear
indication that the Committee would be on hold for some time could limit the response.
Directive Language
","alternative C"
2006-10-24,25,"(25) In the statement accompanying Alternative C, the discussion of growth
could be identical to that proposed for Alternative B.  However, in the second half of
the inflation paragraph, rather than listing the various factors contributing to the
expected moderation in inflation, the Committee could posit that Inflation pressures
seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that moderation is
uncertain. The discussion of inflation could conclude by stating that In these
circumstances, the Committee believed that an additional firming of policy was
appropriate to bolster progress towards achieving price stability.  If, despite the
firming in policy, the Committee continued to be predominantly concerned with
inflation risks, it presumably would want to leave the risk assessment tilted as was
proposed for Alternative B.  However, that sentiment could perhaps be conveyed
more strongly to market participants by adopting the language in paragraph 20 earlier
in this Bluebook noting that the Committee both seeks and expects a gradual
reduction in inflation.
","Alternative C, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2007-03-20,25,"(25) A decision to adopt Alternative C would come as a complete surprise to the
financial markets, likely leading to a sharp upward revision of investors expectations
for the federal funds rate over the next few quarters and thus an increase in short-
term interest rates.  Longer-term rates might also jump if market participants were to
conclude that the inflation outlook is less benign than they had thought and that
short-term real rates will have to be persistently higher to keep inflation contained.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 41
Upward pressure on long-term rates would be lessened if investors conclude that the
FOMCs focus on reducing inflation will mean faster progress toward price stability.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2007-08-07,25,"(25) Although recent readings on core inflation have been subdued, overall
inflation has been elevated, boosted by increases in the prices of oil and other
commodities.  Members may be concerned that high headline inflation might soon
begin to boost inflation expectations, augmenting the upward pressure on core
inflation that is already emanating from the pass-through effects of higher energy and
commodity prices and perhaps from relatively tight labor and product markets.  If so,
the Committee might prefer to raise the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, as
in Alternative C.  Even under the baseline outlook, the optimal policy path shown in
Chart 6 indicates that policy would need to be tightened about 1 percentage point
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 43
over the next year should the Committee wish to bring core inflation down to 1½
percent.  Moreover, members might interpret the fairly strong rebound in second-
quarter real GDP growth and the solid job gains seen through the spring as
indications that there could be greater strength in aggregate demand going forward
than suggested in the staff forecast.  Another possible reason for expecting greater
strength in aggregate demand is that the NIPA revisions revealed that the personal
saving rate has been higher than previously estimated, perhaps suggesting, as in the
Flat saving rate alternative in the Greenbook, that households feel less need to
restrain growth in spending than envisioned in the staff forecast.  If members expect
stronger growth in aggregate demand than projected in the Greenbook, they may be
concerned that pressures on resource utilization will intensifyespecially if they share
the staffs view that the revised GDP data indicate that trend productivity growth and
the economys sustainable growth rate are lower than previously estimated.
","Alternative C"
2007-09-18,25,"(25) A 50 basis point rate cut and the adoption of the statement language in
Alternative A would cause short-term interest rates to decline appreciably, as investors
would be somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the policy action and would also
infer that policy probably would be eased further.  Longer-term interest rates likely
would decline modestly and the dollar would depreciate.  As with Alternative B, the
effect on equity, credit and term funding markets is ambiguous, but the negative
growth outlook in this alternative might well spook investors and cause stock prices
to fall and risk spreads to rise.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2007-10-30,25,"(25) The draft statement for Alternative A, like those for Alternatives B and C,
begins by noting the solid economic performance in the third quarter and the easing
of strains in financial markets.  As the other alternatives, it also recognizes that the
pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term but, by prefacing that
consideration with the word however, gives it more prominence.  The statement
then asserts that the cut in the target rate, combined with the policy easing at the
September meeting, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader
economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets,
replicating the words in the September statement.  The paragraph regarding inflation
is unchanged from September, as in Alternative B.  If the Committee believes that,
after this move, the risks to growth would still be tilted somewhat to the downside
while some upside inflation risks would remain, it could characterize the risks as
balanced and continue by stating its intent to assess the effects of financial and other
developments on economic prospects as in Alternative B.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-01-29,25,"(25) Market participants would be somewhat surprised by a 25 basis point
reduction in the target federal funds rate at this meeting, because the Desks survey
and market data suggest that market participants are placing only about one-third
odds on a 25 basis point easing, with virtually all of the remaining probability
assigned to larger moves of 50 or 75 basis points.  To be sure, the reference in the
risk assessment to acting in a timely manner may be read as pointing to a possible
intermeeting easing of policy.  But, given the smaller-than-anticipated policy action
at this meeting, financial markets might well conclude that further easing moves
would be incremental.  Thus, Alternative C would probably induce a rise in short-
term interest rates; however, intermediate-term yields might rise less or perhaps even
decline if investors concluded that a sluggish near-term pace of policy adjustment
implied that even more easing would be needed down the road.  Equity prices would
likely fall while credit spreads on corporate debt would widen.  At the same time,
five-to-ten-year forward TIPS-based inflation compensation might retrace some of
its recent increase, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could appreciate a bit.
Moreover, given the highly skittish attitudes of investors and relatively illiquid trading
conditions in some markets, policy surprises might well generate unusually large
reactions in financial markets.
","Alternative C"
2008-03-18,25,"(25) This Bluebook presents four policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  The underlined text shown
in red highlights the changes from the January 30 statement, which appears on the page
following the table.  Alternative A cuts the federal funds rate target 75 basis points to 2¼
percent; Alternative B cuts the target 50 basis points to 2½ percent; Alternative C lowers
the target 25 basis points to 2¾ percent; and Alternative D leaves the target federal funds
rate at 3 percent.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining an action from any
one policy alternative with portions of the statement from more than one alternative.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2008-04-29,25,"(25)  Alternative B would likely be viewed by market participants as being
broadly consistent with their expectations.  Investors modal expectation as
implied by financial futures and options prices appears to be for a 25 basis point
easing at this meeting and for the target funds rate to be maintained at 2 percent at
the June meeting.  Taken at face value, these financial market quotes suggest that
the reaction of financial asset prices to Alternative B is likely to be relatively
muted.  However, respondents to the Desks survey of primary dealers expected a
notably lower path for the federal funds rate than that implied by futures prices,
and this divergence makes the reaction to Alternative B somewhat harder to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 29 of 38
","Alternative B, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-06-24,25,"(25) Futures and options quotes suggest that investors think it highly
probable that policy will be left unchanged at this meeting, but expect policy
tightening to begin later this year, perhaps as soon as the August meeting.  The
combination of an unchanged funds rate and the slight implicit tilt towards upside
risks envisioned under Alternative B seems broadly consistent with these
expectations, though it may cause investors to push back their expectations for the
onset of policy tightening a bit.  Short-term interest rates might edge down, but
longer-term rates would probably be little changed.
","Alternative B"
2008-09-16,25,"(25) Futures and options quotes as well as the Desks survey of primary dealers
suggest that market participants do not expect any change in policy until the third
quarter of next year.  Investors read the statement released in August as consistent
with an outlook for unchanged policy, so Alternative B, which is very similar, would
probably not lead them to revise their views.  Market participants will note the shift in
focus of the discussion to the weaker economic activity in the current quarter, but
they will probably take more direction from the forward-looking parts of the
statement, which are unchanged.  In sum, short- and longer-term interest rates, equity
prices, and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in
response to an announcement along the lines of Alternative B.
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
1980-01-08,26,"(26) The relatively high level of interest rates of alternative C
in the first quarter would probably not be long sustained, however, if the
Committee sought a 6 percent growth rate for M-1 for the year 1980. The
funds rate would be expected to decline by early spring, and reach levels
by year-end lower than under alternative B. However, should the Committee
seek to restrain M-1 growth to a 4½ percent rate during 1980, interest
rates would probably change little over the balance of the year.
Directive language
","alternative C, alternative B"
1983-07-12,26,"(26) Alternative C involves an approach that would exert
relatively strong restraint on the aggregates and credit markets over the
near-term. M1 growth might be lower than 10 percent for the year and
growth of M2 over the year would probably be somewhat below the midpoint
of its longer-run range. Under this approach, federal funds would
be expected to rise to 10½ percent or so over the near-term. With the
level of borrowing at the discount window expanding to about $1¼ billion
and market interest rates rising, the current level of the discount rate
would be called into question, as indeed it also would under alternative B.
Total reserves would change little from June to September, and nonborrowed
reserves would drop by about 5 percent at an annual rate if borrowing
rose as specified.
","Alternative C, alternative B"
1985-07-09,26,"(26) Alternative A incorporates M1 growth at a 7 percent
annual rate over the third quarter, and at a 10-1/2 percent annual rate
from its fourth-quarter 1984 base. Growth of M2, and to a lesser extent
M3, would be bolstered under this alternative, as lower interest rates
boosted flows into MMDAs and MMFs. The lower interest rates likely to
develop, if maintained over the balance of the year, would also tend,
along with stronger growth in income, to raise money demand into the
fourth quarter. Under those conditions, growth of M1, M2 and debt for
the QIV 1984 to QIV 1985 period could be around the upper ends of the
specifications of alternative II.
","Alternative A"
1987-07-07,26,"(26) The decline in short-term rates under alternative A would
contribute to a resumption of downward pressure on the dollar, potentially
to a significant degree if this were seen as adding to inflationary pres-
sures. Under these circumstances, any tendency for long-term rates to
decline would be limited and possibly more than offset by the market re-
action to the weaker dollar and inflation anxieties.
","alternative A"
1990-02-06,26,"(26) By contrast, the 1/2 percentage point increase in the funds
rate under alternative C would restrain December-to-March growth of M2 and
M3 to 6-1/2 and 3-1/4 percent, respectively, positioning them just below
the upper bound and at the lower bound of their respective tentative
ranges by March. Most short-term rates would rise in tandem with the
federal funds rate; some widening of risk premiums could occur if reces-
sionary concerns reemerged, given already heightened attention to credit
problems. Such concerns, along with a sense that policy might be more
focused on achieving price stability, would tend to damp the rise in bond
yields. Higher interest rates and lower expected inflation could prompt
an upward movement in the exchange value of the dollar.
Directive language
","alternative C"
1990-07-02,26,"(26) Under alternative A, rates of return on retail deposits,
especially small time accounts, may be somewhat more responsive than
normal to declines in market rates, considering the already ample avail-
ability of retail deposits relative to the flat projected level of deposi-
tory credit. Even so, the public's opportunity costs of holding M2 bal-
ances would be expected to decline enough to stimulate growth in M2 to a
banks would not be expected to pick up much in response to the decline in
short-term rates in current circumstances of diminished willingness to
extend certain types of credit. Thus, an easing of monetary policy would
be less likely to work through increased money and credit supplies at
intermediaries, and would work more importantly through the movement of
rates in securities and foreign exchange markets. M3 from June to
September would be expected to expand at only a 1-1/2 percent rate,
placing growth from the fourth-quarter base of its annual range through
September at 1-1/4 percent.
","alternative A"
1991-07-02,26,"(26) Alternative B embodies the staff projections for money and
debt consistent with the nominal GNP and unchanged interest rates of the
greenbook forecast. With the pickup in GNP, M2 would accelerate to a
up to the middle of its long-run range in September. On a quarterly
average basis, M2 would expand at a 4-1/2 percent rate during the third
quarter which, given the staff projection of an 8 percent increase in
nominal GNP, implies that velocity would rise at a 3-1/2 percent rate.
This increase reflects, in part, the rise in opportunity costs as deposit
rates decline, as well as lags in the adjustment of money holdings to a
marked change in income growth. M3 is expected to increase at a 3 percent
rate from June to September under alternative B, keeping this aggregate a

little below the midpoint of its annual range. The pickup in M3 relative
to the last three months reflects a rise in overall borrowing, including
from banks, as the economy recovers. Total nonfinancial debt is projected
to increase at a 6-3/4 percent annual rate over June to September, raising
this aggregate well into the lower bound of its monitoring range by Sep-
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1992-02-04,26,"(26) M3, under alternative B, would expand at only a 2 per-
cent annual rate over February and March, after even slower growth in
December and January. Acting to buoy M3, in addition to the February-
March pickup in M2, should be further inflows to institution-only
money funds, which have managed to damp the decline in their returns
relative to short-term market rates by extending maturities. However,
sluggish expansion in bank credit and an increase in RTC activity over
the quarter will continue to restrain this aggregate. Under alterna-
tive A, growth in M3 would strengthen slightly more, to a 2-1/2 per-
cent pace. Under either alternative, activity in bond and mortgage
markets would remain brisk. However, such activity will continue to
be directed mostly toward reducing borrowing costs by calling or
refinancing existing debt. Indeed, businesses are expected to pay
down debt again in the first quarter as capital spending remains weak
and equity issuance strong. Although home mortgage borrowing is
expected to firm in response to the reduced loan rates and some pickup
in housing activity, household debt growth is expected to stay anemic
as consumer loans contract. Overall debt growth, at a 3-3/4 percent
rate from the fourth quarter of 1991 to March, will be boosted by
faster growth in federal debt than in December and January. However,
such growth would leave this aggregate below the lower end of its
monitoring range.
Directive Language
","alternative B"
1992-06-30,26,"(26) The turnaround in M2 growth under alternative B should
show through to M3. After its decline over the second quarter, this
aggregate is projected to expand at a 1/2 percent annual rate over the
next three months. Bank credit growth should strengthen some from its
torpid second-quarter pace, though loan demand would still be rela-
tively weak. Domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to move gradu-
ally above its lower bound in coming months, placing its growth from
the fourth quarter of last year through September at 4-3/4 percent.
This strengthening owes almost entirely to heavy federal borrowing, as
non-federal debt growth is expected to remain sluggish.
","alternative B"
1993-07-06,26,"(26) The immediate tightening of reserve market conditions
under alternative C is not built into financial market quotes and would
induce a rise in short-term market interest rates that about matched the
higher funding costs, banks likely would boost the prime rate, perhaps
by the same amount. (In light of the currently wide spread of the prime
rate over banks' cost of funds and their professed greater willingness
to make loans, banks will be less inclined to raise the prime in reac-
tion to an increase in the federal funds rate of only 1/4 percentage
point.) Longer-term market rates also would likely rise, though by
considerably less than short-term rates, as the policy action worked to
relieve the market's residual inflation concerns and to put a damper on
household and business spending and credit demands. Buoyed by more
attractive relative interest returns in the United States, the dollar
would tend to strengthen on foreign exchange markets.
","alternative C"
1994-02-03,26,"(26) The firming in the stance of policy under alternative C
would come sooner than now built into market quotes and would be re-
flected in increases in short-term rates nearly equal to the 50 basis
point hike in the federal funds rate. The action might help to
resolve any questions about whether the Federal Reserve would take
steps to contain price pressures in advance of actual increases in
inflation. If so, forward interest rates further out the yield curve
might eventually even adjust down slightly, tempering the ultimate
rise in longer-term rates. The exchange value of the dollar would
tend to move higher with the more attractive real returns on U.S.
versus foreign financial assets.
","alternative C"
1994-07-05,26,"(26) Three alternatives for the near-term stance of policy
are presented below for consideration by the Committee. Under alter-
native B, federal funds would continue to trade around 4-1/4 percent
and the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing would remain
at $325 million. 15 The federal funds rate would be boosted 1/4
percentage point to 4-1/2 percent under alternative C, and the borrow-
ing allowance would be raised to $350 million. Alternative D would
increase the federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 percent.
","alternative C"
1995-01-31,26,"(26) Choice of alternative B might be viewed as appropriate
if the Committee desired additional readings on the extent of the
economy's forward momentum and of underlying inflationary pressures to
provide a firmer basis for judging whether incremental restraint will
be required to damp aggregate demand sufficiently. In the staff
economic forecast, real GDP growth slips below 2 percent in the second
half of this year, even with an unchanged federal funds rate. Some
recent signs of hesitancy in consumer spending and a considerable rise
in inventories might be seen as pointing to a risk in the economic
outlook that, especially with more monetary policy tightening, an
undesirable degree of economic weakness could emerge later this year.
Current levels of real short- and long-term interest rates are some-
what above secular averages and trend growth of money and debt has
been relatively slow, suggesting that monetary policy restraint is
already in place. Moreover, fiscal policy over the next few years may
turn even more restrictive than the staff has built into its forecast,
spurred on by political initiatives to make more visible progress
toward balancing the federal budget early in the next century. The
effects on U.S. exports of the Mexican crisis, and its possible fur-
ther spillover to other economies represent potential additional de-
pressants on aggregate demand; the current situation could be exacer-
bated by another U.S. monetary policy tightening, which could render
the currencies of those countries even less attractive to interna-
tional investors. Postponing any action would allow time for the
fiscal and Mexican situations to become clearer. Finally, the recent
surprisingly quiescent U.S. price reports may also be signalling that
pressures on domestic productive capacities are not as intense as
conventionally estimated, so that a slowing in economic growth even
along the lines projected by the staff could keep inflation in check.
","alternative B"
1995-07-05,26,"(26) The decision to leave reserve market conditions un-
changed, as under alternative B, might be favored if the staff
economic forecast, which assumes a constant federal funds rate through
early 1996, were viewed as both a reasonable and desirable outcome.
In that forecast, near-term weakness is limited--about sufficient to
bring the economy down to the level of its potential. An unemployment
rate in the vicinity of its natural rate is restored by the third
quarter, thereby nipping in the bud any tendency for inflationary
momentum to build. The declines in real longer-term rates and the
exchange rate that have already occurred, along with the rise in
equity prices, stimulate final sales sufficiently to return growth
close to the rate of its potential by late in 1995, holding the un-
employment rate about constant. However, monetary policy still is a
little to the restrictive side in the Greenbook forecast, leaving a
small amount of slack in the economy over time. Against this back-
drop, and with very recent indicators suggesting a limit to near-term
weakness, the Committee may wish to see macroeconomic data accumulate
that call the staff forecast into question before deciding to ease
","alternative B"
1996-01-30,26,"(26) Money market interest rates would fall by less than a
quarter point under alternative A, given current expectations. Such a
decline in the federal funds rate could be achieved by adding nonbor-
rowed reserves through open market operations, reducing the borrowing
allowance by a small amount, or through a 25 basis point reduction in
the discount rate to 5 percent.17 Intermediate- and long-term
interest rates could drop significantly should market participants
view actions at two successive meetings as suggesting that the Federal
Reserve had reason to believe that economy is weak and inflation risks
are minimal. Against this background, incoming economic data suggest-
ing a more buoyant economy could cause a sharp reversal of the inter-
est rate declines.
","alternative A"
1998-06-30,26,"(26) Consistent with the staffs projections of the annual growth of the monetary and
debt aggregates that were discussed in the previous section, some slowing in the expansion of
M2, M3, and debt is anticipated over the remainder of this year. The staff outlook, which
assumes the maintenance of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, projects that
M2 and M3 will grow at rates of about 4-1/4 percent and 7 percent respectively over the third
and fourth quarters, considerably below their pace so far this year, and that the growth of
domestic nonfinancial debt will edge down a notch. For the most part, this slowing in the
expansion of the money and debt aggregates mirrors the expected step-down in the growth of
nominal GDP in the second half of the year relative to the first. In addition, the growth of
the monetary aggregates should be held down by a waning or reversal of some of the special
factors that boosted them early in the year. Total debt growth should slow as the paydown of
securities by the federal government accelerates slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis and
borrowing by nonfederal sectors edges down. Maintenance of the slightly higher short-term
interest rates of alternative C would lower these growth rates only slightly over this year and
still leave both M2 and M3 above their annual ranges.
Directive Language
","alternative B, alternative C"
2006-10-24,26,"(26) The tightening of policy envisaged under Alternative C would catch market
participants unawares.  Investors would revise up sharply their expectations for the
path of policy over the next year or so.  Short- and medium-term nominal and real
rates would rise markedly.  Nominal long-term yields would probably decline if
market participants concluded that the FOMC was seeking a steeper decline in
inflation or had a lower objective for inflation than they previously thought.  With real
rates higher, the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise, and equity
prices would probably decline, perhaps sharply.

Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2007-08-07,26,"(26) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the assessment
that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace, but reorder the clauses
to underscore the view that the adjustment in the housing sector appears unlikely to
derail the economic expansion.  It could also point to the rebound in growth in the
second quarter rather than to moderate growth in the first half.  The inflation
paragraph could note the subdued readings on core inflation in recent months but
repeat Junes message that a few months of good inflation news does not convincingly
demonstrate a sustained moderation in inflation pressures.  The statement could also
point to the elevated level of overall inflation, in effect providing an additional
rationale for the Committees policy decision.  The statement could conclude by
noting that, even after the increase in the funds rate, the Committees predominant
policy concern remains the upside risk to inflation.
","Alternative C"
2007-09-18,26,"(26) The Greenbook forecast is predicated on an assumption of a quarter-point
easing in policy at this meeting and a second easing at the October meeting.  If the
Committee finds the staff forecast to be both plausible and likely to be the best
attainable outcome under the current difficult circumstances, then it may choose to
ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement pointing to downside
risks to the outlook, as in Alternative C.  Members may judge that the growth
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 29 of 49
outlook has deteriorated, but might not be convinced that the downside risks are
sufficient to justify a 50 basis point easing at this meeting.  Also, they may be unsure
of the magnitude of the macroeconomic fallout from recent financial turmoil, and
prefer to await more information before responding further.  Indeed, they may think
that financial market conditions could improve quickly, along the lines of the Faster
rebound Greenbook alternative simulation.  That view may be reinforced by the
general resilience of equity prices in the face of credit market disruptions, a pattern
that does not seem consistent with a serious financial crisis being underway.
Members may also be concerned that a half-point easing in monetary policy at this
time would be misconstrued by some investors as a sign that the Committee was
responding directly to asset prices, potentially exacerbating moral hazard by
encouraging excessive risk taking among market participants in the future.  Moreover,
some members may be concerned that investors could perceive a half-point easing at
this meeting as signaling a downweighting of the Committees price stability objective.
If so, they may prefer to implement a more modest cut in rates at this time while
expressing the judgment that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks
to inflation, even after the policy easing.  Members may find this option especially
attractive if they are concerned about the speed with which the Committee could
reverse a larger rate cut should financial markets stabilize sooner than currently
expected. A quarter-point easing in policy at this meeting is also in line with the
prescription from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation goal (Chart 6).
","Alternative C"
2007-10-30,26,"(26) Investors currently see a 25 basis point policy easing at this meeting as the
most likely outcome.  Thus, very short-term interest rates would likely change little in
response to an announcement along the lines of that proposed under Alternative A.
However, because market participants expect more than 25 basis points of easing over
the next few quarters, the balanced risk assessment, which would likely be seen as
suggesting that further policy easing may not be forthcoming, could prompt a modest
increase in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates.  If participants interpreted the
statement as suggesting reasonably good odds of sustainable growth given the easier
stance of policy, the equity market might rally modestly and the foreign exchange
value of the dollar could firm a bit.

reflecting a projected leveling-out of 
energy and other commodity prices and 
an easing of pressures on resource 
utilization.  Still, uncertainty about the

January 30, 2008 Statement
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 27 of 39
during the intermeeting period strongly suggests that the outlook for economic growth is
weakening:  Strains in financial markets have intensified, and incoming data indicate that
growth in consumer spending is flagging and labor markets are slackening, and the
tightening of credit conditions now appears to be interacting with the deteriorating
macroeconomic outlook in a mutually reinforcing cycle.  The Greenbook-consistent
measure of the equilibrium real funds rate is about 1¼ percentage points below the level
of the current real rate, suggesting that considerable further easing is necessary to bring
output back to its potential over the medium term.  Moreover, the Committee might see
the risks around the staffs outlook as skewed to the downside, given the absence of
convincing signs of a bottoming in the housing market and the possibility of a sharp
further worsening of financial market conditions.  At the same time, however, the short-
run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation apparently has deteriorated, and
policymakers confidence that inflation will decline might have been eroded by the recent
run-up in energy and other commodity prices, the fall in the exchange value of the dollar,
and the rise in measures of inflation compensation.  In these circumstances, the
Committee might be concerned that additional aggressive policy easing may trigger
increases in inflation expectations that could be costly to reverse.  In view of such
concerns, the Committee might believe that more than 50 basis points of easing before
long may be warranted but might be reluctant to make that full adjustment at this meeting.
","Alternative
B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2008-04-29,26,"(26) If the Committee believes that the substantial easing of monetary
policy to date together with the fiscal stimulus package is likely to provide
considerable support to economic activity and is concerned that inflation might
not moderate at an acceptable pace, it may prefer to keep rates unchanged at this
meeting, as in Alternative C.  With the real federal funds rate close to historically
low levels, the Committee may anticipate that the economy will avoid a
pronounced downturn.  The Committee may not view the incoming data as
suggesting the sort of broad weakening in spending that the staff expects as a
result of the economy shifting to a recessionary state, and hence may put some
weight on the Near-Term Upside Risk scenario in the Greenbook.  Members
might also be worried that inflation may follow a higher trajectory than in the staff
forecast.  Energy and commodity prices have repeatedly surprised to the upside in
recent years and members might attach some likelihood to this pattern continuing,
as illustrated in the Greater Inflationary Pressure scenario in the Greenbook.
Moreover, members might feel that the pass-through of past cost increases into
retail prices could be greater than anticipated by the staff.  In addition, some
indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months and members
might worry that long-term inflation expectations could drift up further if inflation
remains around its current elevated level, a development that would be costly to
reverse.  In that regard, members might be troubled that core PCE inflation has
averaged more than 2 percent in every year since 2004 and is forecast by the staff
to do so again in 2008.  In a similar vein, members might be concerned that the
apparent deterioration in inflation expectations could cause inflation to settle at an
unacceptably high level once economic activity returns to more normal level and
the downward contribution to inflation from the projected slack in resource
markets dissipates.  These considerations might suggest that the Committee stay its
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 38
hand at this meeting in order to allow more information to accumulate on
prospects for both growth and inflation.
","Alternative C"
2008-06-24,26,"(26) If, in view of recent developments, the Committee judges that the
growth outlook has improved appreciably or that inflationary pressures have risen
significantly, then it may prefer to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting,
as in Alternative C.  Also, members may see prompter firming than assumed in
the Greenbook as appropriate if they are more optimistic than the staff about
growth prospects in the second half of the yearas they were in their economic
projections in April.  Indeed, the current stance of monetary policy might now be
viewed as giving excessive support to aggregate demandsome measures of real
short-term interest rates have declined further over the intermeeting period, and
members may believe that this will have a larger effect on spending than
envisioned by the staff.   Risk considerations also might argue for beginning to
firm policy relatively soon.  In particular, since last August, the Committee has
eased policy aggressively, in part to mitigate downside risks to growth stemming
from financial market turmoil.  However, financial market conditions have
improved somewhat in recent months:  Risk spreads have generally declined, bond
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 33 of 41
issuance has picked up, and many financial institutions have been successful in
raising new capital.  In these circumstances, the Committee might see it as
important to be prompt in reversing the earlier aggressive easing of policy.
Members may also be worried that the recent rise in many measures of inflation
expectations could presage a more serious unmooring of inflation expectations
that would prove costly to reverse later, along the lines of the Higher Inflation
Expectations scenario.  In particular, members might be concerned that, in
current circumstances, the Committee could be perceived as willing to tolerate the
inflationary consequences of higher energy prices and less resource slack.  Also,
they may think that heightened inflation pressures could persist to a greater degree
than incorporated in the staff forecast:  Oil prices have soared over the last year,
even as futures quotes consistently implied that they were about to level out.
Members may prefer a tighter stance of policy if they are worried that this pattern
could continue (along the lines of the Ongoing Commodity Price Pressures
scenario), or if they believe that the pass-through of rising food and energy prices
into core inflation may turn out to be greater than envisioned by the staff.  Finally,
the Committee might share the staffs assessment of the underlying forces shaping
the economy, but may prefer a tighter stance of policy in order to foster a more
rapid moderation in inflation than is foreseen in the staff forecast.
","Alternative C"
2008-08-05,26,"(26) This Bluebook presents two alternatives for the Committees consideration,
summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative B, the target
federal funds rate would be maintained at 2 percent at this meeting, while Alternative
C involves a 25 basis point tightening to 2¼ percent.  The statements for both
alternatives note that inflation has been high.  Alternative B leaves the stance of policy
unchanged, but the statement places somewhat greater emphasis on inflation risks
than the Committees statement in June.  Alternative C, after noting the possibility
that inflation may not moderate as the Committee anticipates, states that the policy
action was intended to better balance the risks to its goals.
","Alternative B, Alternative
C, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2008-09-16,26,"(26) If the Committee both thinks that it is important that it be seen to be
responding to the continued high levels of inflation and has fairly high confidence in
the resilience of financial markets and economic activity, it may prefer to tighten
policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C.  PCE inflation in the
third quarter is projected to be its highest since the first quarter of 1990  and above
inflation expectations remain above their levels of recent years.  Against this
backdrop, the Committee may feel that failing to tighten policy could lead market
participants and households to question its commitment to price stability, as in the
Unanchored inflation expectations alternative scenario in the Greenbook.
Moreover, most simple policy rules call for a federal funds rate that is considerably
above its current level (Chart 8).  Although financial market conditions remain
strained, members may judge that the financial situation is being adequately addressed
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 31 of 41
by the various measures that the Federal Reserve has put in place to support market
liquidity and by the Treasurys actions to stabilize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  As a
result, the Committee may see the slowdown in growth as transitory, along the lines
of the Financial rebound Greenbook alternative scenario, and be concerned that
holding the federal funds rate at its current level would impart excessive momentum
to the economy going forward, undercutting efforts to bring inflation down.
","Alternative C"
1985-07-09,27,"(27) Alternative C contemplates a more marked slowing of money
growth over the months ahead than alternative B, with M1 specified to
grow at a 4 percent annual rate. Adjustment plus seasonal credit at the
discount window would be expected to increase to around $600 million, with
growth in nonborrowed reserves slowing to a one percent annual rate over
the coming three months. The federal funds rate would be expected to
rise to around the 8-1/4 to 8-1/2 percent area, and other interest rates,
as well as the foreign exchange value of the dollar, would increase

This greater slowing of money growth and tightening of credit conditions
would increase the odds that M1 might approach its current long-run upper

1987-07-07,27,"(27) Alternative C assumes a $200 million increase in the path
allowance for borrowing to $700 million. The federal funds rate would
climb to the 7 to 7-1/4 percent area and the bill rate would post a
similar increase. Firmer conditions in the money market would act to
postpone the reemergence of downward pressure on the dollar in exchange
markets and the possible reduction of inflationary concerns would temper
any tendency for Treasury bond yields to rise. There could be some widen-
ing in quality spreads, though, if the effects of this policy action were
seen as aggravating debt servicing difficulties, including through weaker
income growth, both at home and abroad.

1989-07-05,27,"(27) Under alternative B, M2 would grow at a 6-1/2 percent rate
over the June-to-September period, lifting this aggregate to the bottom of
its annual target cone in September. Despite the small rise in short-term
interest rates expected under this alternative, opportunity costs of hold-
ing M2 balances would remain below levels of the first quarter. Further
contributing to a pickup in M2 growth is the likelihood that outflows from
demand deposits--which have been much larger than expected--will diminish
appreciably and possibly cease over this period, as the recent decline in
market rates is reflected in compensating balance requirements. Retail
deposit growth at thrifts should remain near that of commercial banks, as
it has recently. On a quarterly average basis, M2 would grow at about a
expansion of nominal GNP in the staff forecast. Its M1 component would
edge higher over the June-to-September period, but owing to the declines
in May and June would decline at a 3 percent rate on a quarterly average

1990-07-02,27,"(27) The tightening of monetary policy under alternative C would
not accord with the prevailing expectations of investors, and interest
rates across the maturity spectrum, along with the exchange value of the
dollar, would ratchet higher. The rise in longer-term yields could be
restrained by concerns about the resilience of economic activity, espe-
cially given the likelihood of some further tightening of credit avail-
ability, as well as by the implied lessening of future inflationary pres-
sures. The associated widening of opportunity costs, as market interest
rates rise relative to deposit and money fund rates, would serve to damp
M2 to a 1-1/2 percent rate of growth over the June-to-September period,
dropping that aggregate to around the lower end of its current range. M3
would be anticipated to slow to only a 1/2 percent pace over these months.

the growth of the monetary aggregates, and by implication in the growth of
the economy as well later this year and in early 1992. The staff pro-
jects that M2 growth would be at a 6-1/2 percent rate from June to Septem-
ber under alternative A. By September, M2 would be a little above the
midpoint of its annual range. The further easing of monetary policy
contemplated under alternative A would catch market participants by
surprise, and short-term market interest rates would drop considerably.

to its fourth-quarter 1992 level in March. In response to more attrac-
tive opportunity costs and the boost to income, M2 would be on a tra-
jectory to reach the lower bound of its long-run alternative II range
for 1993 by June, but would remain noticeably below its alternative I
range. Bigger inflows to savings and MMDAs, as well as to M1 balances,
would account for the faster growth in M2 in the months ahead. A
buildup of institution-only money funds, as holders responded to more
attractive rate relationships, would buoy M3 over February and March
under alternative A, and hold down the net declines in this aggregate
over these two months. Nonetheless, the level of M3 in March would
remain well below that of the fourth quarter of 1992, and the firmer
path of this aggregate in subsequent months still would not be
sufficient to return it to its fourth-quarter level until July.
","alternative A, alternative A"
1993-07-06,27,"(27) The easing of reserve conditions embodied in alternative
A would represent an unexpected direction for policy, especially in
light of the market's understanding of the Committee's recent policy
predilection. The Federal Reserve would be seen as putting more
emphasis on supporting economic growth, perhaps in light of the recent
weaker economic data and the possible restraining effects of the fiscal
package. Market participants would expect short-term rate declines to
be reversed eventually, but still would anticipate that rates would
trade around lower levels over the coming year than currently built into
the term structure. Consequently, the downward adjustment of short- and
intermediate-term market rates would be close to the 1/2 percentage
point drop in the federal funds rate. As usual, bond yields would not
fall by nearly as much, partly because investors might become a little
more worried about future inflation. The exchange value of the dollar
would be depressed. Implementing this alternative would reduce
financial intermediaries' costs of funds, encouraging them to relax
their terms and conditions for business and consumer loans.
","alternative
A"
1994-02-03,27,"(27) The easing of policy under alternative A would come as
more of a surprise to market participants. Some could interpret the
action as a response by Federal Reserve policymakers to weaker inter-
nal economic forecasts than the market consensus, perhaps owing to
concerns about upcoming fiscal drag. But others would be led to
question the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary resolve. In those
circumstances, an adverse impact on inflation expectations could well
result, preventing much of a decline in bond yields. Even the fall in
short-term rates could be muted by the view that the policy ease would
soon have to be reversed to forestall excessive price pressures. The
dollar's exchange value could be lowered by both the reduced U.S.
short-term rates and heightened concerns about U.S. inflation.
","alternative A"
1994-07-05,27,"(27) The staff forecast of rising interest rates does not
necessarily assume tightening at this meeting, but would seem to call
for aggressive action later in the quarter should underlying demand
for goods and services turn out to be as strong as implied in the
staff outlook. Alternative B might be chosen by the Committee if it
wished to await confirmation of the strength of aggregate demand,
perhaps because there were questions about whether that strength would
in fact be forthcoming. This alternative might also be preferred if
the Committee felt the staff had overestimated probable inflationary
pressures. Market participants seem somewhat uncertain about the
likelihood of Committee action at the July meeting; some anticipate
that the Federal Reserve will pause a little longer in its process of
firming to assess the effects of its actions so far, but on balance
they seem to have put the odds on a quarter-point move at greater than
a little after the meeting under alternative B. Long-term rates are
not likely to decline, however, under this alternative; the dollar
might remain under some downward pressure, and the markets might
continue to focus on the potential for greater inflation, especially
if data confirm brisk growth.
","Alternative B, alternative B"
1995-01-31,27,"(27) While market participants currently anticipate a 50
basis point increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting, their
response to the Committee's selection of alternative B would depend on
how the decision were interpreted. On the one hand, the market reac-
tion could be muted if the decision were seen as only a delay in tak-
ing the inevitable next step, perhaps until the Mexican situation
settles down somewhat. In that circumstance, delay might be seen as
the prudent response to a potentially volatile situation, and little
adverse concern about potential inflation would be engendered. Some
edging lower of short-term interest rates might transpire, but bond
yields and the value of the dollar could remain near recent quotes.
On the other hand, the unexpected delay in policy tightening could
create some confusion about the Federal Reserve's intentions and
strategy. If market participants viewed the delay as unwarranted by
the domestic economic situation and as signalling a possible change in
Federal Reserve priorities, heightened inflation concerns could cause
an adverse reaction in the fixed income and foreign exchange markets.
Such a reaction could be compounded by data suggesting continued
strength in employment and a pickup in inflation--both of which are
expected over the near term in the Greenbook forecast.
","alternative B"
1995-07-05,27,"(27) Over the past few days, markets have come to view policy
action at this meeting as much less likely, and interest and exchange
rates probably would change little with the choice of alternative B,
though a further small backup in yields cannot be ruled out with the
disappointment of some residual expectations of prompt easing. Mar-
kets are likely to view data over the intermeeting period consistent
with the staff forecast as mixed; broad measures of production and
employment would continue to the soft side, with the unemployment rate
moving higher and inflation lower than in the first half, but in-
dicators of sales should show some firming tendencies. In these cir-
cumstances, market participants likely would continue to see inflation
risks as more muted and an intermediate-term policy ease as still a

1996-01-30,27,"(27) If the Committee agreed with the staff outlook for
spending and inflation and wanted to make deliberate progress toward
price stability, the choice of a quarter-point increase in the federal
funds rate under alternative C might be favored. Such a policy tight-
ening would come as a complete surprise to market participants, and
short-term interest rates would rise substantially. Intermediate- and
long-term rates would also move appreciably higher, especially in real
terms, as market participants re-evaluated the expected path for mone-
tary policy. With the direction of interest rates here and abroad
beginning to diverge, the dollar could well strengthen further on
foreign exchange markets.

outlook for growth and inflation would be identical to that in Alternative B, but the
balance of risks would point to the downside.

2008-01-29,27,"(27) The statement under Alternative D reiterates several elements of the
rationale portion of the January 22 statementincluding references to considerable
stress in financial markets, tightened credit conditions, and deepening of the
housing contractionbut does not cite recent developments in labor markets.
Because this alternative leaves the stance of policy unchanged, the statement simply
indicates that recent policy actions should promote moderate growth over time.
This alternative reaffirms the Committees expectation that inflation will moderate
in coming quarters, but adds the same explanation as in Alternative C regarding
the factors that could put upward pressure on inflation.  Moreover, with no change
in policy and few economic data releases on the calendar between January 22
and January 30, the assessment of risks in Alternative D is identical to that of
the January 22 statement.

2008-03-18,27,"(27)  The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative B would
begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity, pointing specifically
to the softening in consumer expenditures and labor markets.  The statement would also
point out that financial markets remain under considerable stress and that the tightening of
credit conditions, coupled with the deepening of the housing contraction, is likely to weigh
on economic growth in the near term.  The paragraph on inflation would note that the
Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters assuming a projected

monitor inflation developments carefully.  The final paragraph would repeat the
assessment of risks from the January statement.
","Alternative B"
2008-04-29,27,"(27) The discussion of economic activity in the proposed statement for
Alternative C is identical to that in the statement suggested for Alternative B.
And, as in Alternative B, the draft inflation paragraph continues to indicate that
inflation seems likely to moderate in coming quarters.  However, in contrast to the
FOMC statement in March, the factors expected to contribute to that moderation
are not explicitly identified in order to emphasize the uncertainty attending the
Committees outlook for inflation.  The proposed risk assessment notes that
although downside risks to growth remain, the Committee judged that more
time is needed to better assess economic prospects and the effects of the policy
actions taken to date, thereby explaining why the stance of policy was left
unchanged at this meeting.  Although the statement concludes by reiterating that
the Committee will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and
price stability, market participants may see the statement as suggesting that the
pause in policy actions could continue for a while.

2008-06-24,27,"(27) The discussion of economic activity in the proposed statement for
Alternative C is identical to that in Alternative B.  The relatively downbeat
assessment of the growth outlook might suggest to markets that adoption of this
alternative did not necessarily represent the start of a rapid firming in policy.
However, the inflation paragraph in Alternative C points to the elevated level of
headline inflation and acknowledges that some indicators of inflation expectations
have increased furtherreferring to the increase in short-term inflation

over the intermeeting period.  Under this alternative, the firming in policy would
be cited as a factor that the Committee expects to cause inflation to moderate.
However, the risks that attend this expectation would be highlighted by indicating
that uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high and that inflation
developments will continue to be monitored carefully, as in the April FOMC
statement.  The final paragraph of Alternative C has no balance of risks
assessment, but simply notes that future policy adjustments will depend on the
evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.

2008-08-05,27,"(27) If the Committee views the staff forecast, which is conditioned on an
unchanged target federal funds rate through the end of the year, as reasonable and
sees the outcome as acceptable in the circumstances, it may wish to leave the policy
rate unchanged at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  The Committee, like the staff,
may expect financial conditions and the sharp contraction in the housing market to
exert considerable restraint on aggregate spending over the next year or so, and thus
may view a relatively low real federal funds rate as necessary to promote moderate
economic growth.  At the same time, the resilience to date in consumer spending may
provide some assurance to policy makers that overall economic activity, though
sluggish, is continuing to expand and is likely to accelerate gradually in coming
quarters as the contraction in the housing sector begins to fade and financial market
conditions begin to improve.  The actual real federal funds rate based on lagged four-
quarter core PCE inflation is roughly in line with its Greenbook-consistent
equilibrium value (Chart 6), a setting consistent with output moving back toward
potential over the next few years.  Of course, headline inflation has been elevated, and
is likely to jump this quarter, reflecting the earlier surge in crude oil prices.  But, with

balance the upside risks to inflation and the

increase in coming months, the Committee may anticipate that inflation pressures will
moderate later this year and through next year.  With such an outlook, the Committee
may judge that holding the funds rate constant at this meeting is appropriate given its
dual objectives.  Indeed, the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 2
percent, shown in Chart 7, prescribes a target funds rate that remains at roughly its
current level through the end of 2009 before beginning to firm thereafter.  The
Committee may also see risk considerations as arguing for an unchanged stance of
policy at this meeting.  Surely, the downside risks to growth remain significant:
Consumer spending could weaken substantially, given the low level of consumer
confidence, the weakening labor market, and diminishing credit availability; fiscal
policy may provide less impetus than currently anticipated; and financial markets
remain under considerable stress and may impose more restraint on growth than
currently anticipated.  At the same time, the persistent tendency of energy prices to
increase in recent yearsand importantly, the resulting upward pressure on inflation
and inflation expectationsmay cause the Committee to feel that the upside risks to
inflation are also substantial.  Overall, the Committee may still see considerable
uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation.  In these circumstances,
the Committee may wish to leave the target funds rate unchanged and await further
economic and financial information before adjusting the stance of policy.

2008-09-16,27,"(27) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in
Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B.  However, Alternative C cites the
accommodative stance of monetary policy rather than past policy easings as a factor
that should support growth in the future because policy would be tightened under this
alternative.  The inflation paragraph in Alternative C indicates that inflation has
remained high.  The statement goes on to emphasize that the possibility that
inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant concern to the Committee,
and then notes that the policy firming at this meeting was intended to provide
additional assurance that inflation will abate as desired.  This indication that the
move was taken as a type of anti-inflation insurance, along with the earlier discussion
of the current period of economic weakness, may suggest that the tightening would
not necessarily be followed by a series of upward adjustments to the funds rate.

1989-07-05,28,"(28) M3 growth would strengthen to a 7 percent clip over the
June-to-September period under alternative B. Bank credit is projected to
be somewhat stronger in coming months, partly reflecting the possibility
of major corporate restructuring activity, which would be funded initially
by banks. On a quarterly average basis, M3 would grow at a 5-3/4 percent
rate, implying some decline in its velocity. Domestic nonfinancial debt
is expected to expand at a 7-1/2 percent rate from June to September,
leaving this aggregate 7-3/4 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-
quarter base.

1991-07-02,28,"(28) Alternative C also would catch market participants un-
awares, and short-term interest rates likely would adjust upward rather
sharply. Bond yields also would rise, but by considerably less than
short-term rates if market participants came to the view that the Federal
Reserve was taking the opportunity to make more decisive progress against
inflation. The foreign exchange value of the dollar might well increase
considerably further under this alternative. M2 would expand at only a
falling off over the quarter. M2 would still be below the midpoint of its
range in September and would be headed for a lower position in its range
by year-end, with the effects of higher interest rates reinforced by some
restraint on nominal spending. M3 probably would expand at a 2-1/2 per-
cent rate over the June-to-September period, keeping this aggregate a
little below the midpoint of its range.

","Alternative C"
1993-02-02,28,"(28) Under alternative C, M2 would decline over February and
March as larger opportunity costs act as an additional drag on this
aggregate. The rebound in its M1 component in March would about offset
a decline in February and it, too, would be about unchanged over these
two months. M3 would drop at a 1/4 percent annual rate over February
and March, as less attractive returns on M3-money funds lead to out-
flows from such funds. The weaker trajectory of this aggregate in
later months implies that even by midyear it would remain well below
its fourth-quarter 1992 level.

","alternative C"
1994-07-05,28,"(28) The Committee could see alternative C as appropriate if
it believed that sufficient evidence had accumulated to warrant a
continued gradual tightening of policy to prevent the economy from
overheating. Because the 25-basis-point firming in the federal funds
rate under this alternative is not fully incorporated in current mar-
ket quotes, other short-term interest rates would probably edge up in
response. This action could provide some support for the dollar;
however, if it were undertaken in the context of a seriously weakening
dollar, and were seen as intended primarily to prop up the currency,
it could well be viewed by the market as insufficient. That circum-
stance aside, greater market confidence that inflation pressures might
be restrained could help limit increases in intermediate- and long-
term interest rates in response to this alternative. With market
portfolios now generally aligned to expectations of gradually rising
money market interest rates, the move seems unlikely to prompt further
increases in actual and implied volatility in bond markets.
","alternative C"
1995-01-31,28,"(28) Concern about the possibility of an adverse market
reaction, combined with a view that the economic situation still
pointed to significant risk of accelerating inflation, would argue for
the 50 basis point firming in the federal funds rate associated with
alternative C. In a situation in which the economy already has over-
shot its potential, the robust advance of economic activity through
last quarter might well signify the likelihood that monetary policy
still has not put in place sufficient restraint to slow the growth of
future aggregate demand enough to forestall a sustained upward drift
in inflation. Moving up the federal funds rate to 6 percent would
more clearly place real short-term interest rates in a range that
could be characterized as moderately restrictive. Even if slower real
GDP growth emerges than in the staff economic forecast, which assumes
unchanged short-term interest rates, such an outcome would aid in
bringing resource use over time back to less potentially inflationary
and, hence, more sustainable levels.
","alternative C"
1995-07-05,28,"(28) A reduction in the federal funds rate, perhaps of the
as a form of insurance against the downside risks in the economic
outlook. The slowdown in consumer spending of late has been puzzling
and foreign growth has weakened unexpectedly, raising some question of
whether the recent weakness in the economy might persist and deepen.
In that event, waiting for clearcut evidence of a sustained slowdown
would be waiting too long to counter the weakness in spending. More-
over, even if the current slowdown were thought likely to be short-
lived and mild, the risks of rising inflation have been greatly re-
duced, given that the economy is moving back to its level of potential
output and pressures on prices at early stages of production have been
abating. If so, holding the real federal funds rate at its current
somewhat elevated level, especially when the long-run sustainable rate
may be depressed by fiscal restraint, might no longer be appropriate.
That is, the financial market conditions associated with the unchanged
policy of alternative B, including the backup in long-term rates in
the staff forecast, might be seen as unnecessarily risking weak spend-
ing. Even in the staff forecast, unemployment in the latter part of
to see inflation level out at something over 3 percent rate--as in the
easier scenario--rather than aim to tilt it down, it might be more
disposed to consider a policy easing.

1996-01-30,28,"(28) The table below shows money and credit growth under
alternative B for the January-to-June period. Relative to the ex-
perience of recent months, we would expect some pickup in credit
growth to accompany the staff GDP projection, partly as the federal
government returns to more normal patterns of funding and cash
balances given the assumed lifting of the debt ceiling. Growth of
total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to expand at a
center of its tentative range for 1996. The expansion in M2 is ex-
pected to continue to be supported by last year's declines in oppor-
tunity costs and the relatively flat yield curve. The spread of
sweeps will lead to further reductions in M1 and the reserve aggre-
gates. By midyear M2 would be at or slightly above its 1-to-5 percent
tentative 1996 range under all three alternatives. M3 at midyear
would be just within its 2-to-6 percent range.

inclined to respond only gradually to the evolving circumstancesan impression that

2008-03-18,28,"(28)  Investors place roughly even odds on both 50 basis point and 75 basis
point reductions in the target federal funds rate at this meeting.  As a result, adoption of
Alternative B would likely cause near-term policy expectations to move somewhat higher.
Equity prices might decline, and yield spreads on private-debt instruments over those on
Treasuries could widen, should market participants conclude that monetary policy was not
being eased sufficiently promptly to cushion adequately the weakness in economic activity.
Any such adverse effects, however, would likely be tempered by the Committees
acknowledgment that the downside risks to growth remain and that the Committee is
prepared to act in a timely manner to address those risks, a communication that would
likely be interpreted as indicating that members are still predisposed to ease policy further.
Given the smaller-than-expected policy move and the indication in the statement of
greater concern about inflation risks, market participants could mark down their inflation
expectations slightly.  Any move in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be
relatively small.  However, in light of impaired trading conditions in many markets and
investors increasingly skittish attitudes, even small policy surprises have the potential to
generate an outsized reaction in financial markets.

2008-04-29,28,"(28) Alternative C would come as a surprise to market participants, who
appear fairly confident that the funds rate target will be cut by at least 25 basis
points at this meeting.  This surprise would be compounded if the accompanying
statement is interpreted as suggesting that policy may remain on hold over the next
few meetings.  Investors would likely mark up their expectations for the path of
policy over the next few quarters, leading to an increase in short- and intermediate-
term interest rates.  Pressures in short-term funding markets could worsen.  Long-
term nominal Treasury yields would rise by less or could even fall if the
Committees decision caused investors to revise down their expected trajectory of
future inflation.  With real rates higher, equities would probably fall, credit spreads

they would be surprised by the adoption of Alternative C.  The expected path of

notwithstanding the relatively pessimistic growth paragraph and the absence of any
explicit mention of inflation risks.  Accordingly, short-term interest rates would
rise and equity prices would fall.  There is a risk that these moves could be quite
pronounced if investors interpreted the adoption of this alternative as signaling a
substantially more rapid pace of policy tightening than had been anticipated.
However, longer-term nominal interest rates and inflation compensation might
decline if the Committees decision caused investors to mark down their
expectations for inflation at longer horizons.  The foreign exchange value of the

2008-08-05,28,"(28) In the statement under Alternative B, most of the discussion of the outlook
for growth is little changed from June.  The statement notes that economic activity
has continued to expand, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and
exports.  This characterization has been changed from some firming in household
spending because consumer spending slowed a bit in the second quarter and
increases in exports have been contributing significantly to output growth and are
expected to continue to do so.  The statement again notes that labor markets have
softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress.  The
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 28 of 36
language refers to elevated energy prices instead of the rise in energy prices
because oil and natural gas prices have moved down, on net, since the last meeting,
but remain high.  The statement under Alternative B would differ from the one in
June by moving the sentence stating that past policy easing and Federal Reserve
liquidity facilities should promote moderate economic growth from the assessment
of risks paragraph to the economic rationale paragraph.  In so doing, the factors that
explain the outlook for economic activity are consolidated in the same paragraph,
making the treatment parallel to that of the outlook for inflation.  The rationale
section makes the frank observation that inflation has been high, and attributes this
situation to the previous increases in energy and other commodity prices.  While the
statement continues to note that the Committee expects inflation to moderate
through time, it also indicates that uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains
high.  The assessment goes on to state that although downside risks to growth
remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee.
Although it does not explicitly make a judgment as to the relative weight of these
risks, on the whole the statement gives a bit more emphasis to the upside risks to
inflation than the June statement.  The statement uses the same language as in June to
achieve its dual objectives.

2008-09-16,28,"(28) Market participants are very confident in their outlook for no change in
policy at this meeting and would be quite surprised by the adoption of Alternative C.
The expected trajectory of the federal funds rate for the next several months would
likely be marked up at least 25 basis points, and might move up further if investors
thought the Committee was more likely to raise rates going forward.  Other short-
term interest rates would rise accordingly.  Longer-term rates would probably increase
as well.  Inflation compensation would likely decline a bit, as investors concluded that
the Committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation.  Equity prices
would fall, perhaps sharply, while the exchange value of the dollar would probably

movements in asset prices, would likely intensify strains in financial markets, perhaps
","Alternative C"
2008-12-15,28,"(28) This Bluebook presents four alternatives for the Committees consideration,
summarized by the draft statements on the following pages.  In view of the sharp
deterioration in the economic outlook, the proximity of the zero lower bound on
nominal interest rates, and the unconventional policy actions that have already been
announced, the content and structure of the proposed alternatives differ substantially
from previous Bluebooks.  Under Alternative A, the Committee decides not to set a
target for the federal funds rate, states that it anticipates that weak economic
conditions are likely to warrant funds rates near zero for some time, and makes clear
that its main policy tool going forward will be actions that make use of the Federal
Reserves balance sheet.  Under Alternative B, the Committee instead announces a
target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent and states that it will use all
available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and price
stability.  Under Alternative C, the target rate is cut 50 basis points to ½ percent and
the possibility of a further downward adjustment, should conditions warrant, is left
open.  Under Alternative D, the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at
economic growth over time; as in Alternative C, the possibility of future policy easing
is left open.  In view of the large amounts of reserves being provided by the Federal
Reserves various liquidity facilities, Alternatives C and D recognize that federal funds
may trade below the target rate for at least some time.  All four alternatives
acknowledge that economic activity appears to have slowed further since the last
FOMC meeting.  Alternatives A, B, and C note that the Committee expects inflation
to moderate in coming months and even sees some risk that inflation could drop
below levels consistent with price stability; Alternative D uses the same language on
inflation as the October statement.  To make clear that adjusting the funds rate is not
the Federal Reserves only policy tool in a world of very low interest rates, all four

alternatives point to the recent announcements that the Federal Reserve will purchase
large volumes of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and will implement the
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  Alternatives A, B, and C also
explicitly refer to the possibility of further using the Federal Reserves balance sheet to
support financial markets and economic activity, including by purchasing Treasury

1989-07-05,29,"(29) The extent of the easing of policy embodied in alternative A
would be larger than expected by market participants for the very near
term, although the current structure of market rates appears to reflect
expectations of a drop in rates of this magnitude in the next few months.
With federal funds moving immediately to around 9 percent or a bit above,
short-term rates would edge lower. The three-month Treasury bill rate
would settle below 8 percent. The dollar likely would come under downward
pressure, especially if, in light of the recent increases in monetary
restraint abroad, policy easing were viewed by the market as, in part, a
coordinated effort to stem strength in the dollar. Long-term rates would
tend to move lower, although with some easing already built into the yield
curve the decline could be minor.
","alternative A"
1993-07-06,29,"(29) Projected M2 growth over the third quarter diverges rela-
tively little across the three alternatives, ranging from 1/2 percentage
point under alternative C to 1-1/2 percentage point under alternative A.
The similar growth rates reflect the diminished sensitivity on balance
of M2 demand to short-term market interest rates in recent years, as
capital market instruments have become closer substitutes for M2 bal-
ances in household portfolios. If, for example, short-term market rates
are reduced. M2 is boosted as deposit rates fall by less. This effect,
which attracts funds from money market instruments, is partly offset by
shifts into capital market instruments, whose realized returns are
boosted temporarily by capital gains and whose yields over time drop by
less than deposit rates. Given this damped interest rate response, even
if the money market conditions of alternative A continued through year-
end, M2 growth over the year would still be only 1-1/4 percent, notice-
ably below the 2 percent lower bound of the Committee's current annual
range. By contrast, M1 seems to have retained its greater sensitivity
to changes in the funds rate that emerged after the nationwide introduc-
tion of NOW accounts in the early 1980s. Projected growth of this nar-
row aggregate from June to September ranges from 4-3/4 percent under

1994-02-03,29,"(29) M2 growth likely will be held down under alternative B
by a reversal of the previous bulge attributable to mortgage refinanc-
ing activity, which had boosted average M2 growth by an estimated 1
percentage point during the October through December months, before
becoming a minor drag in January. Over the February-to-June period,
falling prepayments of mortgage-backed securities are projected to
deduct 1 to 2 percentage points from M2 growth.13 Nevertheless, the
underlying trend of M2 is anticipated to strengthen enough to leave
actual M2 growth at a 2 percent rate from January to June. Inflows to
bond and stock mutual funds through June should be somewhat weaker
than the pace of last year, as a result of the flatter yield curve and
likely smaller capital gains. 14  In addition, previous declines in
offering rates on liquid deposits evidently have brought them into
full alignment with money market rates, so this drag on M2 expansion

may well have finally played itself out. Even so, the underlying
trend of M2 growth is likely to remain below that of nominal spending,
as some of the anomalous weakness relative to historical patterns that
surfaced in the 1990s is assumed to persist.
","alternative B"
1995-01-31,29,"(29) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate
embodied in alternative C, by matching current financial market expec-
tations, would have few initial repercussions on market interest rates
or exchange rates against our other G-10 trading partners. However,
some strengthening of the dollar against the peso cannot be ruled out.
Banks likely would hike the prime rate by a commensurate amount and
might become somewhat more cautious in their other lending terms and
standards as they saw a slowing in economic growth as more clearly in
","alternative C"
1995-07-05,29,"(29) Immediate implementation of the 1/2 percentage point
cut in the federal funds rate of alternative A would represent a
considerably more aggressive policy action than currently is priced
into financial markets. Thus, short-term interest rates initially
would decline further, with the rally probably showing through to some
degree in bond markets as well. The exchange value of the dollar is
likely to depreciate. At this point, market participants likely would
be somewhat puzzled by this action, and the response of market prices
would depend largely on their interpretation. A larger response in
fixed-income and foreign exchange markets would be elicited to the
degree that the 1/2 percentage point rate cut led the market to think
that the Federal Reserve was responding to significant underlying
weakness in the economic outlook. In this case, the policy action
might be seen by market participants as only the first in a series of
reductions in short-term rates. Such a perception could be mitigated
if the reserve market action were not accompanied by a cut in the
discount rate. Should the Committee instead decide on only a 1/4
percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate, the financial
market impact could be appreciably less, though further Federal Re-
serve action likely would be anticipated.
","alternative A"
2000-02-01,29,"(29) This bluebook proposes three short-run monetary policy alternatives for the
Committee's consideration at this meeting: an unchanged stance of monetary policy
(alternative B); a 25 basis point firming of the federal funds rate (alternative C); and a 50
basis point tightening (alternative D).
","alternative B, alternative C"
2008-04-29,29,"(29) In contrast, if the Committee continues to view the outlook for
economic activity as unacceptably weak, it may prefer to reduce the target funds
rate by 50 basis points at this meeting, as proposed in Alternative A.  The
Committee might judge that financial headwinds could continue to exert a
significant drag on economic growth through much of next year and thus policy
may eventually have to be eased by more than envisaged by the staff, a possibility
explored in the Greater Financial Stress scenario in the Greenbook.
Alternatively, the Committee might share the staffs assessment of the underlying
forces shaping the economy and the probable extent to which policy will need to
be eased in order to foster a return to more normal levels of activity, but judge that
the downside risks to growth are such that it is preferable to adjust rates more
promptly than suggested by the staff forecast.  In particular, the Committee might
feel that an adverse feedback loopin which weakness in the real economy
exacerbates strains in financial markets which in turn feed back onto economic
activityremains a distinct possibility and that it is prudent for policy to respond
decisively to reduce the risk of this dynamic taking hold.  In this case, members
might be willing to tolerate the likelihood of a somewhat higher path for inflation
than in the staff forecast in order to respond more aggressively to the possibility of
significant weakness in output.  In that regard, the optimal-control simulation with
an inflation goal of 2 percent prescribes a trajectory for the target funds rate that
drops close to 1 percent by the end of 2009, notably softer than the policy path
assumed in the Greenbook.
","Alternative A"
2008-06-24,29,"(29) If the Committee remains particularly worried about downside risks to
the outlook for economic activity, then it may prefer to ease policy by another
quarter point at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  The unemployment rate has
increased sharply in recent months; in the past, such sharp increases have always
been accompanied by recessions.  Mortgage rates and corporate bond yields have
risen over the intermeeting period, tightening financial conditions and adding to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 35 of 41
the restraint on aggregate demand.  Members may also view financial market
functioning as still quite fragile:  Short-term funding markets remain strained,
financial firms share prices have fallen sharply over the intermeeting period, and
some financial institutions have reported large losses and their credit ratings have
been downgraded.  A little more policy accommodation may be seen as
appropriate insurance against the macroeconomic consequences of the risk that
financial market functioning might deteriorate once again.  The Committee might
also be concerned that the reasonably firm consumer spending data in the second
quarter might simply reflect a greater degree of anticipatory spending by
households of their fiscal stimulus rebates than assumed in the staff forecast,
implying that growth in the second half of the year could be lower as this effect
wanes.  Indeed, the apparent resilience in economic activity could be interpreted as
just a delay in the possible onset of a cyclical downturn, along the lines of the
Recession alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  Although the recent sharp
increases in energy prices may well add to inflationary pressures in the short run,
they are also likely to weigh on household and business spending.  In such
circumstances, the Committee might think that there will be sufficient resource
slack to contain inflation pressures, even with a slight further easing of policy.
","Alternative A"
2008-08-05,29,"(29) Futures and options quotes suggest that investors do not expect any change
in policy until the end of this year.  Moreover, market participants have taken
particular note of monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period that
seemed to stress the significant downside risks to economic growth, and most
respondents to the Desks survey do not expect the statement to suggest increased
inflation concerns.  As a result, the language envisioned under Alternative B might
lead investors to conclude that policy tightening may commence sooner than currently
thought.  Short-term interest rates would probably increase a bit following such an
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 29 of 36
announcement.  Longer-term interest rates would likely also move higher, but
inflation compensation might tick down if investors surmised that policymakers were
a little less tolerant of inflation than currently perceived.  Equity prices would
probably decline some, while the exchange value of the dollar might increase.
","Alternative B"
2008-09-16,29,"(29) If the Committee sees recent developments as pointing to a weaker
economic outlook and less pronounced inflation pressures, members may instead be
attracted to the statement language of Alternative A.  The substantial decline in
energy prices in recent months, if not reversed, will pull down top-line inflation,
which may prevent elevated inflation rates from becoming embedded in expectations.
Indeed, near-term inflation expectations have come down appreciably over the
intermeeting period, as has five-by-five inflation compensation.  Moreover, the
passthrough of the lower energy prices, coupled with a higher level of unemployment,
should add to downward pressure on core inflation.  Members may also see the recent
marked rise in the exchange value of the dollar as likely to contribute to a reduction in
inflation while restraining overall economic growth.  In addition, financial strains
appear to have extended to a wider range of financial institutions over the
intermeeting period, in some cases creating severe pressures on their balance sheets
and even uncertainty about their solvency.  The ongoing pullback in credit availability
has the potential to weigh on economic growth for a considerable period, as in the
More-persistent headwinds scenario discussed in the Greenbook.  The real federal
funds rate (based on lagged four-quarter core PCE inflation) is roughly in line with its
Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value, which the Committee may see as an
appropriate policy stance in the present circumstances (Chart 6).  Still, the Committee
may now see risks to both inflation and output as considerable and roughly equal and
may wish to adjust the language in the statement to treat them symmetrically.
","Alternative A"
2008-12-15,29,"(29)   If the Committee agrees that the economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly since the October meeting and thinks that substantial monetary stimulus
will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor
Alternative A or Alternative B.  Members may be disappointed by a forecast, such as
the one presented in this Greenbook, in which economic activity contracts severely
this quarter and in the first half of next year and recovers only slowly after that, even
with a federal funds rate at 25 basis points through 2010 and with substantial fiscal
stimulus.  Accordingly, Committee members may feel that even stronger policy action
than what is assumed in the Greenbook will be necessary to promote a return to
sustainable economic growth.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, the Committee
may be concerned that the projected sharp contraction in economic activity, coupled
with the striking ongoing decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, may
cause inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level, perhaps even lower than
projected in the staff forecast (as in the Lower Inflation alternative scenario in the
Greenbook).  In these circumstances, Committee members may thus wish to take a
bold action at this meeting to counter the risk of deflation, and they may also want to
presage further expansions of the Federal Reserves balance sheet.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
1989-07-05,30,"(30) With money market rates and opportunity costs dropping under
alternative A, M2 growth would strengthen to an 8 percent rate over the
June-to-September period, bringing this aggregate into the lower end of
its annual target cone in August. The pickup in M2 would be most evident
in its liquid components, and M1 would strengthen to a 2 percent rate of
expansion over the three-month period ending in September. M3 growth
would firm under this alternative to a 7-1/2 percent rate, boosted in part
by larger inflows to institution-only money funds.
","alternative A"
1994-02-03,30,"(30) M3 is projected to expand at a 1-1/4 percent rate from
January to June under alternative B. The growth of debt of domestic
nonfederal sectors from December to June is projected at a 5-1/4 per-
cent rate, sustaining the faster growth rate recorded during the
fourth quarter of last year. The overall debt aggregate is foreseen
as expanding at a 5-1/2 percent rate through midyear, leaving this
measure somewhat below the midpoint of its provisional monitoring
Directive Language
","alternative B"
2000-02-01,30,"(30) Despite the significant inflation risk embodied in the staff forecast and
identified in the Federal Reserve's announcement following the December meeting, the
Committee might not yet be convinced that policy action is necessary and hence might be
inclined to choose alternative B. Even though labor markets have remained tight for some
time, readings on core prices generally have been well behaved, excepting the pickup in
various NIPA inflation measures for the fourth quarter reported today. While these reports
may be disquieting, the four-quarter changes in these measures remain moderate. Taken
together with other price reports, the recent behavior of core inflation may still be
consistent with trend productivity growth that is strong enough, or a natural rate of
unemployment that is low enough, to restrain inflation for considerably longer than in the
staff forecast. In light of this possibility, the Committee may wish to wait awhile in order
better to assess the extent of inflationary pressures. If the Committee were to keep the
stance of policy unchanged, however, it presumably would want to accompany
announcement of that choice with a statement, under its new policy, that ""the risks are
weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the
foreseeable future,"" given the high rate of labor utilization and the continued strength in
demand that could push that rate even higher.
","alternative B"
2008-03-18,30,"(30) The two paragraphs in the rationale portion of the statement associated with
Alternative A are identical to those in Alternative B.  However, the assessment of risks
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 30 of 39
differs from that in Alternative B by noting explicitly the risks to both growth and
inflation.  Alternative A also indicates that the Committee judges that the downside risks
to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation and that the FOMC is prepared to act in
a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B, Alternative A"
2008-04-29,30,"(30) The discussion of the outlook for economic activity and inflation in the
draft statement accompanying Alternative A is identical to that proposed for
Alternative B.  The draft risk assessment also follows Alternative B in omitting the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 32 of 38
judgment from the March FOMC statement that downside risks to growth
remain, and so indicates that policy has moved to a more neutral stance.  The
statement concludes by reiterating that the Committee will act in a timely
manner to promote economic growth and price stability.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-06-24,30,"(30) The discussion of recent developments and the outlook for economic
activity and inflation in the draft statement accompanying Alternative A is not
much changed from the April FOMC statement.  The apparent strength in
consumer spending in the second quarter is acknowledged, but the language
describing the outlook remains quite downbeat.  In the first sentence of the
inflation paragraph, the reference to core inflation having improved is updated
to describe recent readings as stable, consistent with the incoming core inflation
data.  The phrases in that sentence are reordered to emphasize the point that core
inflation has been stable.  Alternative A gives no explicit assessment of the risks to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 36 of 41
either growth or inflation, but simply repeats the risk assessment paragraph from
the previous statement, pointing to liquidity measures and the cumulative easing of
policy as providing support to growth.
","Alternative A, Alternative A"
2008-08-05,30,"(30) If the Committee sees the economy as growing more robustly than the staff
does and has fairly high confidence in the resilience of financial markets, it may prefer
to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C.  Members may
view the current stance of policy as too accommodative, providing substantial impetus
to aggregate demand at a time when the economy apparently retains an unexpected
degree of momentum and when inflation expectations may be less tightly moored
than previously.  If the Committee is more upbeat about the underlying strength of
the economy than the staff, along the lines of the Resilient spending Greenbook
alternative scenario, members may believe that the time is right to reduce the current
degree of policy accommodation so as to foster the desired moderation in inflation.
Although financial market conditions remain strained, and downside risks to growth
persist, members may see those risks as having diminished considerably over recent
months and believe that some of the policy accommodation that served as insurance
against an extremely adverse outcome for economic growth should be removed.  This
view may be strengthened by the expectation that the various measures that the
Federal Reserve has put in place to bolster market liquidity, including the new steps
announced on July 30, will help to mitigate the risk that policy tightening could have
an outsized impact on financial market functioning.  Moreover, high readings on
inflation have persisted for some time and could be causing inflation expectations to
move higher, as illustrated in the Greenbooks Inflation spiral scenario.  Finally,
members may wish to bring inflation down more rapidly than in the Greenbook
projection and thus wish to begin tightening policy at this meeting, perhaps along the
lines of the optimal control simulation with an inflation target of 1½ percent.

","Alternative C"
2008-09-16,30,"(30) The statement under Alternative A differs from that under Alternative B
only in its discussion of the inflation outlook and the assessment of risks.  In
particular, while still noting that inflation has been high, the alternative indicates the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 33 of 41
Committees expectation that the recent decline in energy and other commodity
prices and increased slack in resource utilization will foster a moderation of inflation.
The statement again notes that the outlook for inflation is uncertain, but adopts
language that suggests the Committee sees the risks to growth and inflation as roughly
equal  The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of
significant concern to the Committee.  Taken together, the adjustments suggest a
greater degree of confidence that inflation will moderate as well as a more balanced
outlook with regard to any future policy moves.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2008-12-15,30,"(30) Against this backdrop, the Committee may decide not to announce a target
for the federal funds rate at this meeting and signal instead that its focus has shifted to
the use of the Federal Reserves balance sheet as an especially important policy tool
going forward, as in Alternative A.  The Federal Reserves balance sheet has already
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 39 of 60
expanded considerably in recent months and will continue to expand in the immediate
future as the Federal Reserve begins to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed
securities in volume, as already announced, and as the TALF becomes operational.
Federal funds have often traded below 50 basis points since the October meeting
even with the current target of 1 percent.  In the last week, with the anticipation of
further policy easing at this meeting, federal funds have traded persistently below
towards balance sheet management as essentially already under way.  Committee
members may also be mindful that announcing a target that is not possible to achieve
may create the impression that Federal Reserve policy is ineffective, even though
powerful tools remain at the Committees disposal to address the deteriorating
economic and financial situation.
","Alternative A"
1989-07-05,31,"(31) The tightening of reserve conditions under alternative C
would come as a surprise to the financial markets. With federal funds
moving to 10 percent or a bit higher, money market rates would climb about
on foreign exchange markets. Bond rates would tend to rise under this
alternative, although the extent of any such rise would be limited to the
degree that market participants saw the move as unsustainable or focused
on its impact on inflation pressures over time.

restrained by the slower pace of nominal income growth projected by
the staff in the third quarter as well as by the effects of the pre-
vious and expected further widening of opportunity costs. Moreover,

the volume of flows into bond and stock funds is expected to pick up a
little as concerns about capital losses in these markets diminish. 16
Partly offsetting these influences should be the gradual levelling out
of mortgage refinancing activity. With interest rates on small CDs
rising more quickly than those on liquid deposits, inflows to small
time deposits should account for an appreciable proportion of M2
growth. Although currency growth also is expected to remain rapid
owing to continued strength in foreign demands, transaction deposits
are expected to be about flat on balance, as average yields below 2
percent on NOW accounts limit flows into other checkable deposits and
as compensating balances fall in response to increases in earnings
credit rates. M1 is expected to increase at only a 3-1/2 percent rate

this aggregate's expansion would remain well below that of nominal
GDP--projected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent rate over the first half of

debt growth of 5-1/2 percent from December to June, domestic nonfinan-
cial debt is foreseen as growing at a 5-1/4 percent rate over the six
months, near the midpoint of its provisional 3 to 7 percent monitoring
range for 1995. Nonfederal debt likely would continue to grow near
the 5 percent pace of last year, with some slowdown in consumer credit
expansion offsetting a probable cessation of the runoff of state and
local debt.

B"
2000-02-01,31,"(31) In view of the macroeconomic situation and recent Federal Reserve
statements, market participants uniformly seem to expect a tightening of monetary policy at
this meeting, with considerable weight currently being placed on a 25 basis point move and
some probability on a 50 basis point increase. In these circumstances, implementation of
the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, even if accompanied by a
statement that the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside, would confuse investors.
Nonetheless, financial markets, especially for equities, would rally if investors trimmed their
expectations of the extent of cumulative monetary tightening. Short-term market interest
rates would drop nearly 1/4 percentage point, and the dollar would weaken on foreign
exchange markets.
","alternative B"
2008-03-18,31,"(31) With market participants putting significant odds on both 50 basis point and 75
basis point cuts at this meeting, selection of Alternative A would likely leave short- and
intermediate-term interest rates a little lower.  Market participants would probably interpret
such an aggressive interest rate cut, together with the indication that downside risks to
growth predominate, as suggesting that the Committee is inclined to further policy easing.
This combination might bolster market confidence, causing equity prices to rise and credit
spreads on corporate debt to narrow some.  However, longer-term yields might move
higher if market participants became concerned that the Committee was underestimating
inflation risks or was more willing to tolerate higher rates of inflation going forward than
earlier anticipated.
","Alternative A"
2008-04-29,31,"(31) With investors attaching little weight to the possibility of a 50 basis point
cut in the target funds rate at this meeting, Alternative A would come as a
considerable surprise to financial markets.  Short- and intermediate-term interest
rates would move lower.  Long-term nominal Treasury yields and measures of
inflation compensation could increase if the Committees action was interpreted as
implying that it was willing to tolerate a higher trajectory for inflation than
investors had previously thought.  Equity prices would probably rise and the
foreign exchange value of the dollar could weaken further.  However, these
responses would be damped somewhat to the extent that the accompanying
statement was read as suggesting that the Committee was not inclined to ease rates
further after this meeting.

","Alternative A"
2008-06-24,31,"(31) With investors expecting the funds rate to be increased this year, the
adoption of Alternative A would surprise financial markets.  Short- and
intermediate-term interest rates would fall, but long-term nominal Treasury yields
and measures of inflation compensation would probably increase, as investors
came to perceive the Committee as willing to tolerate a higher trajectory of
inflation than had been thought.  Equity prices might rise, while it is likely that the
foreign exchange value of the dollar would depreciate.

","Alternative A"
2008-08-05,31,"(31) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in
Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B.  This cautious view of the prospects
for economic growth might suggest to markets that adoption of this alternative did
not necessarily represent the beginning of an aggressive policy tightening episode.
However, unlike Alternative B, Alternative C cites the accommodative stance of
monetary policy rather than just the past policy easings as a factor that should
support growth in the future.  The inflation paragraph in Alternative C, like that in
Alternative B, notes that inflation has been high.  The statement goes on to
emphasize that the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of
significant concern to the Committee and then notes that the policy firming at this
meeting was intended to better balance the risks to growth and inflation.  This
language does not claim that the risks after the move would be completely balanced,
thus leaving the door open to subsequent policy firming, but the statement does not
suggest that such firming would necessarily be imminent.

2008-09-16,31,"(31) Despite the changes in the statement language in Alternative A, the market
reaction may not be very large.  The observation that the substantial decline in oil
prices is likely to contribute to a moderation in inflation will come as no surprise to
market participants.  Furthermore, investors already expect policy to be unchanged
for several quarters and reportedly read the August statement as essentially signaling a
shift to a balanced assessment of risks, so a more explicit indication in that regard may
not spark much reaction.  Indeed, the Desks survey found that primary dealers expect
the statement to be changed slightly to indicate a somewhat weaker outlook for
growth and reduced inflationary pressures.  Still, the greater confidence expressed in
the statement that inflation will moderate may be seen as freeing up the Committee to
ease policy if necessary should the outlook for the economy worsen.  In consequence,
short-term interest rates may decline somewhat following such an announcement.
Long-term rates would likely edge down only a bit if at all, while inflation
compensation could tick higher if investors see the FOMC as having become less
vigilant with respect to inflation risks.  Equity prices may increase moderately, and the
exchange value of the dollar might decline a little.

Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term
interest rates will remain low for some time.   Members may be reluctant to enter into
an unconditional commitment because they may feel that such a commitment would
be too constraining should they need to tighten policy sooner than now expected.  To
mitigate this concern, the Committee could phrase the commitment in implicitly
conditional terms by indicating its anticipation that weak economic conditions are
likely to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time, as suggested in the
statement accompanying Alternative A.10  In addition, if members were concerned
that even increased use of the Federal Reserves balance sheet as a policy tool and a
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 40 of 60

counter deflationary pressures, the Committee could explicitly state, as indicated in

includes a specific reference to the federal funds rate appears on page 30.)
","alternative B"
2000-02-01,32,"(32) The announcement following the December meeting indicated that the
FOMC was concerned that a continuation of rapid demand growth could lead to an
escalation of inflation pressures. If anything, the upside risks to the economy and inflation
seem to have intensified over the intermeeting period, perhaps inclining the Committee
toward the 25 basis point firming of policy of alternative C. Indeed, those risks would
mount should financial markets rally as a result of policy inaction. And although
productivity may still be accelerating, the momentum of spending risks outstripping the
expansion in available labor, exacerbating strains in already-taut labor markets. The staffs
assessment is that considerable policy firming will be necessary to contain inflation. Even if
the Committee finds this assessment plausible, it still may want to proceed incrementally, as
it typically has done, because of uncertainty about the response of financial markets to its
actions, about the sensitivity of spending to financial market conditions, and about the
reaction of inflation to labor market conditions. Moreover, long-term inflation expectations
remain damped, suggesting that a rapid shift in the stance of policy is not essential at this
point. Still, the Committee may wish to express the view that, even after the 100 basis
points of cumulative tightening since mid-1999, the risks remain tilted toward increased
inflation pressures.
","alternative C"
2008-03-18,32,"(32) If the Committee believes that the economic outlook has weakened but is
concerned that aggressive further policy easing amid unfavorable inflation readings could
increase the likelihood of a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, it may wish to lower
the funds rate target by just 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C.  In
particular, this alternative might be favored if the factors underlying the recent increase in
inflation were viewed as likely to be more persistent than envisaged in the staffs
projection.  In light of recent data, the Committee might see the short-run tradeoff
between economic activity and inflation as having worsened to a greater extent than
judged by the staff and believe that the scope for monetary policy to provide stimulus to
growth while applying adequate restraint to inflation has decreased noticeably.  Such a
deterioration in the short-run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation could
reflect in part an increase in inflation expectations, as illustrated in the Greenbooks More
Inflationary Pressures scenario.  The difficulty of reliably detecting shifts in inflation

expectations may bolster the case for this alternative, especially if the Committee perceives
an upward drift of such expectations as being very costly to unwind.
","Alternative C"
2008-08-05,32,"(32) Investors marked down their expected policy path over the intermeeting
period and now place very low odds on a rate hike at this meeting, or indeed before
the end of the year.  Accordingly, they would be quite surprised by the adoption of
Alternative C.  The expected trajectory for the federal funds rate would be marked up,
perhaps substantially.  Short-term rates would rise accordingly, as the new, higher path
for policy was built into asset prices.  Longer-term rates would probably increase as
well, but inflation compensation would likely decline a bit, as investors concluded that
the Committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation.  Equity prices
would fall on the news, while the exchange value of the dollar would probably
appreciate.  If market participants interpreted this action as implying that policy would
be tightened fairly rapidly in the near term, strains in financial markets could worsen,
and perhaps significantly so if a tighter path for policy was seen as likely to depress
house prices further or more rapidly than currently expected.  In response to the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 31 of 36
emphasis given to inflation developments in the statement, investors might respond
more sharply to incoming news bearing directly on consumer prices over subsequent
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2008-12-15,32,"(32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the
further weakening of the outlook for economic activity rather than with a sentence
about the federal funds rate.  This departure from the standard structure of the
FOMC statement is intended both to emphasize that the focus of the Committee has
shifted away from the target federal funds rate and to provide a clear rationale for that
shift.  The second paragraph notes the weakening of inflationary pressures and the
risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic
growth and price stability.  As noted above, members may wish to conclude that
paragraph with the sentence, In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek
to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index of personal consumption
expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term.  By using the words seek to
achieve and in the medium term, the Committee would acknowledge that it may
not be possible to maintain inflation at the desired level over the specified period, but
the statement would nonetheless signal the Committees policy objective.  If members
were uncomfortable with taking such a step at this meeting, they could simply omit
that sentence from the statement.  The third paragraph notes the Committees
decision not to set a specific target for the federal funds rate, acknowledges that the
federal funds rate has already declined to very low levels, and states the expectations
that federal funds rate will remain near zero for some time.  The statement goes on in
paragraph 4 to indicate a shift of the Committees focus from the target rate to the use
of the Federal Reserves balance sheet.  That paragraph repeats a number of measures
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 41 of 60
that have already been announced but not (or only partially) implemented, thereby
emphasizing that a number of unconventional policy actions are already forthcoming,
and foreshadows the possibility that the Federal Reserve will purchase longer-term
Treasury securities if conditions warrant.  The intention to continue to actively
consider policies that employ the Federal Reserves balance sheet is also explicitly
stated in order to clarify that other tools could also be used if needed to support credit
markets and economic activity.
","Alternative A"
2008-03-18,33,"(33) The statement accompanying Alternative C would explicitly acknowledge that
the upside risks to inflation have increased by pointing to recent unfavorable readings on
inflation and by emphasizing the factors that could potentially exert upward pressure on
inflation going forward.  As under Alternative B, the statement would point out that
members expect inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but would conclude that the
upside risks to the outlook for inflation have increased.  The rationale paragraph for this
alternative would also state that recent policy actions should help to promote moderate
growth over time, but downside risks to growth remain.  The risk assessment would
reflect the Committees judgment that the risks to growth outweigh the risks to inflation,
particularly in light of stresses in financial markets,  and the statement would end by
noting that the Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to address the evolving

2008-10-28,33,"(33) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A
the federal funds rate target is cut 50 basis points to 1 percent; under Alternative B the
federal funds rate target is cut 25 basis points to 1¼ percent; and under Alternative C
the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at 1½ percent.  All three alternatives
begin by noting the deterioration in financial conditions and the weakened economic
outlook.  Alternatives B and C note the plethora of recent policy actions around the
world, suggesting that these actions will help to promote a return to moderate
economic growth; Alternative A includes no language to soften its negative view of
the outlook for economic activity.  With respect to inflation, Alternatives A and B
express confidence that inflation will moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent
with price stability, whereas Alternative C retains the phrasing from the statement
following the intermeeting cut on October 8, which acknowledges reduced upside
risks to inflation without commenting on its likely future path.

1997-07-01,34,"(34) The Committee may favor the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B if
it thinks that chances are that the staff has not gone far enough to incorporate a more
favorable tradeoff between resource use and inflation into the outlook. But even if the staffs
current forecast were to prove about right, the deterioration in inflation performance would
unfold gradually enough that the Committee may judge that it can afford to wait for clearer
evidence on the situation. Certainly, the hard evidence in hand does not point to an imminent
step up in inflation, despite the low rate to which unemployment has fallen. And the odds
that recent inflation performance reflects, at least to some degree, a more lasting structural
change, as opposed to a confluence of temporary factors, surely go up the longer inflation
remains subdued. No change in the stance of monetary policy at this FOMC meeting is built
into the structure of market interest rates, so financial market prices would react little to the
Committee's choice of alternative B. Over the upcoming intermeeting period, some firming in
Treasury bill rates should accompany the return to positive net issuance of bills, while early
signs of a pickup in economic growth after a pause in the second quarter could well induce
some upward pressures on bond yields. In the context of evidence of a widening trade
deficit, these interest rate increases are not expected to contribute to upward pressure on the

2008-03-18,34,"(34) A decision to adopt Alternative C would come as a significant surprise to the
financial markets.  Investors would presumably revise up sharply their expectations for the
path of policy over the next few quarters, leading to an increase in short- and intermediate-
term interest rates.  At the same time, long-term nominal Treasury yields would likely rise
by less or could even fall if investors concluded that the FOMC had a lower tolerance for
inflation than they had previously thought.  With real rates higher, equities would fall,
credit spreads on corporate debt would widen, strains in financial markets would intensify,
and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise.

appropriate given the deterioration in the economic outlook, but wishes to adjust
policy relatively gradually, it may want to reduce the target federal funds rate 25 basis
points at this meeting as in Alternative B.  Even if members have not revised down
their forecast for economic activity as much as the staff, they may still believe that
easing is called for.  In view of the negative tone of the recent economic data, the
worsening of financial conditions since mid-September, and the reduction of
inflationary pressures implied by the large drop in energy prices and the outlook for
significant economic slack, members may view the 50 basis point intermeeting move
in early October as only a partial step toward suitably balancing the risks to the
outlook and think that that action should be augmented with a further policy
adjustment at this meeting.  At the same time, members may be less pessimistic about

the outlook than the staff for several reasons and hence believe that more limited
policy action than assumed in the Greenbook is appropriate.  For example, they may
believe that financial conditions will improve sooner than assumed by the staff, as in
the Greenbooks More Rapid Financial Recovery scenario.  Or, they may think that
passage of a second fiscal stimulus package is likely and perhaps that such a package
could be larger or more potent than those presented in the Greenbooks Fiscal
Stimulus scenarios.  Although these Greenbook alternative scenarios indicate that
more policy easing would still be desirable, they might suggest less urgency to take
further large steps.  Alternatively, should the Committee share the staffs downbeat
economic outlook but see a near-term reversal of policy as costly, members might
view a series of gradual steps as more prudent than one or two large moves because
there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, particularly concerning the
effects of the many official actions recently implemented.
","Alternative B, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2008-12-15,34,"(34) If the Committee shares the staff view that the economic outlook has
deteriorated markedly and thinks that, given the circumstances, moving the federal
funds rate near the zero bound on nominal interest rates is desirable, but it wants to
continue to provide an explicit target for the federal funds rate, then it might choose
to establish a target range of 0 to ¼ percent as in Alternative B.  Continuing to set a
target that encompasses very low federal funds rates would not compromise the
Committees ability to resort to unconventional policy measures.  In addition, some
members may be concerned that switching to the use of the Federal Reserves balance
sheet as its main policy tool could delay a return to a more conventional monetary
policy based on interest rate targeting because some unconventional policy measures
(such as the purchases of long-term assets) may not be easy or cheap to unwind
quickly.  Consequently, members may feel that maintaining a target range, however
low, could be desirable because it may make a return to more traditional monetary
policy simpler and more straightforward once economic and financial conditions
improve.  In addition, Committee members may see the maintenance of a federal
funds target as advantageous from a governance perspective, since the determination
of the target rate is a prerogative of the Committee, whereas the Committee and the
Board both have separate authorities that can be used to affect the composition and
size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet.
","Alternative B"
1997-07-01,35,"(35) The 1/4 percentage-point increase in the federal funds rate embodied in
alternative C might seem appropriate if the Committee sees the likelihood of intensifying
inflation pressures, as in the Greenbook, and wishes to impart some resistance to the
anticipated acceleration of prices. The idea that the current degree of pressure on productive
resources could be sustained without inducing an eventual upward spiral in wages and prices
might be viewed by the Committee as still too speculative to risk deferring further preemptive
policy action. Indeed, it could even believe, as does the staff, that many of the forces that
have acted to hold down inflation in the recent past are likely to be abating in the near future.
For example, a list of the forces that might be mostly played out by now include: (i) in-
creases in the labor force participation rate, which have kept strong aggregate demand from
generating a still lower unemployment rate; (ii) lower increases in the cost of worker benefits,
which have restrained labor costs; (iii) slow adjustment in inflation expectations to the lower
path of actual inflation, which also has conditioned wage and price setting; and (iv)
appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar, which has induced outright declines in
import prices. Judging by the relationships incorporated in the ""Longer-Term Strategies""
section of this document, a 25 basis point rise in the funds rate represents only a small down
payment on the increase that would be needed to contain inflation permanently at about a
down to such a rate, it might consider a 50 basis point firming at this FOMC meeting. Even
if the tradeoff between resource use and inflation through the end of next year proves to be
still more favorable than is now incorporated in the staff forecast or in those model exercises,
the consequences of choosing a more restrained policy stance at this meeting may not be seen
as adverse. The Committee might well view it as a favorable outcome if the economic
expansion were to proceed at a slightly slower-than-projected pace but with a declining path
for inflation that better conformed to the Federal Reserve's long-run goal of stable prices.

2008-10-28,35,"(35) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative B would
begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity, pointing
specifically to the softening in consumer spending.  The statement would also point
out that financial market strains have intensified and that the resulting tightening of
credit conditions is likely to impose additional restraint on spending.  The paragraph
on inflation would note that recent declines in the prices of energy and other
commodities, along with greater prospective economic slack, should cause inflation to
moderate to levels consistent with price stability.  (See the box Likely Market
Interpretation of Price Stability Language.)  The change in wording, from reduced
upside risks in the October 8 statement to an expected moderation of inflation in the
language for Alternative B, suggests that Committee members have become much
more confident that inflation will decline.  The final paragraph would note the
numerous policy steps already taken in recent weeks to increase liquidity in financial
markets, strengthen financial systems around the world, and promote economic
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 34 of 45
growth.  While indicating that these actions should support economic activity going
forward, the statement also notes that they have not eliminated downside risks.  The
statement concludes with the final sentence of the October 8 statement, highlighting
the Committees intention to act as needed in support of its objectives.

there would be no incentive for depository institutions to sell funds without
compensation.  It may even be undesirable, given the strains that it could put on some
financial institutions and financial markets.  On the other hand, members may feel
that the direct monetary stimulus obtained by bringing the target rate to a very low
but positive level, along with the increased flexibility thereby provided to use
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 60
nonconventional policy actions, outweighs the associated costs.  As in Alternative A,
the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity
and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause
inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level.  In such circumstances, conditional on
their desire to maintain a federal funds rate target, Committee members may prefer to
make that target as low as possible immediately, rather than making a more gradual
adjustment, to counter the risk of further severe deterioration in economic and
financial conditions.

guard, inducing an immediate selloff in securities markets and an appreciation of the dollar in
exchange markets, with short-term interest rates jumping by virtually the same amount as the
intended funds rate. Market participants would likely interpret the tightening as another
preemptive action that would underscore their sense of the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary
resolve. To the extent that, as seems likely, market participants continued to perceive that
any potential inflationary threat was rather muted, they would probably extrapolate further
firming moves only to a limited extent, thereby restraining the reaction in financial market
prices. A 50 basis point firming would, of course, represent an even greater surprise to
market participants and would induce a still sharper backup in interest rates and drop in
equity prices.

slightly above the rate of 1.1 percent implied by federal funds futures contracts at the

futures rate may reflect the possibility that federal funds will continue to trade below
the target in coming weeks; 12 it is likely that at the time of the Desks survey, both
dealers and futures market participants expected a cut in the target funds rate of about
contracts closing after the October meeting have declined another 10 basis points
amid investor concerns about the economic outlook, and they now suggest
expectations of about 40 basis points of easing at the upcoming meeting.  Thus, a 25
basis point cut to 1¼ percent would leave the target federal funds rate somewhat
above current market expectations.  Nevertheless, the clear shift in the statement
language away from concern about inflation risks and toward an emphasis on growth
risks would likely lead investors to anticipate further rate cuts, and this alternative
appears broadly consistent with readings for the funds rate at the end of the year that
are implied by futures markets.  As a result, our best estimate is that adoption of
Alternative B would have only small effects on prices of financial assets.

2008-12-15,36,"(36) The rationale section of the statement under Alternative B begins by noting
the recent deterioration in economic conditions and in the outlook for economic
activity.  The statement is also explicit as to the reduction in inflationary pressures and
economic growth and price stability in the longer term.  The fourth paragraph makes
clear the intention to use all tools at the Committees disposal to promote the
resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  Some of
these toolsthe already announced purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed
securities, the possible expansion of those purchases, the possibility of beginning to
purchase longer-term Treasury securities, the implementation of the TALF, and the
possible expansion of other types of liquidity provision and other means of using the
Federal Reserves balance sheetare also noted.

tenance of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, were described in the previous
section. In brief, for the year as a whole the staff projects growth of M2 and M3 of 4-1/2
and 6-1/2 percent, respectively, just below their pace from 1996:Q4 to June, and of domestic
nonfinancial debt of 5 percent, just above its pace from 1996:Q4 to May. Maintenance of the
slightly higher short-term interest rates of alternative C would lower these growth rates only
slightly over this year.

2008-10-28,37,"(37)  If the Committee, like the staff, has marked down significantly its
assessment of economic prospects and now sees an immediate and substantial policy
response as appropriate, it may want to reduce the target federal funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Recent economic data releases have been
almost all weaker than anticipated, with consumer outlays down sharply.  Moreover,
financial conditions have deteriorated substantially since the September meeting:
Equity prices fell sharply over the intermeeting period; mortgage rates moved higher; 
                                           
12 The October 22 announcement of a decrease in the spread between the target federal 
funds rate and the rate of interest paid on excess reserve balances had little apparent effect 
on futures rates.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 36 of 45
corporate bond yields jumped; and the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
shows that extraordinarily high percentages of banks tightened standards and terms
on loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  With regard to
inflation, the latest news on commodity prices and inflation expectations, in
conjunction with the appreciation of the dollar in recent months and the likelihood of
a marked increase in economic slack, provides substantial assurance that inflation will
moderate.  Even if the Committee has not marked down its outlook for the economy
as much as the staff, it may view the downside risks as having increased.  Moreover,
with the Greenbook-consistent measure of the equilibrium real funds rate having
dropped about 2 percentage points below the level of the current real rate, even a less
pessimistic outlook than the Greenbooks could be consistent with a considerable
further reduction in the target federal funds rate.
","Alternative A"
2008-12-15,37,"(37) Given that most market participants appear to expect only a 50 basis point
reduction in the target at this meeting, a decision to reduce it instead by at least
apparently anticipate that the target will be brought down to ¼ percent at the January
meeting.  As a result, nominal interest rates would likely decline a little, stock prices
may increase some, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar may decline
modestly.  As in Alternative B, market participants may also be surprised by the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60
reference to unconventional policy measures, and medium- and long-term Treasury
yields might edge lower.
","Alternative B"
2008-10-28,38,"(38) The rationale section of the statement for Alternative A highlights the
recent deterioration in financial and economic conditions, with specific references to
weak consumer spending and industrial production and to the slowdown in foreign
economic growth.  As under Alternative B, the section also points out the likely future
spending restraint implied by the further tightening of financial conditions.  The
discussion of inflation would be identical to that under Alternative B, noting the
reasons to expect a moderation of inflation to levels consistent with price stability.
The assessment of risk would emphasize the Committees readiness to act as needed
to promote growth.
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative B"
2008-12-15,38,"(38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C for a number of reasons.
Members may feel that a substantial policy easing at this meeting is warranted in
response to the sharp deterioration of the economic outlook in recent weeks.  A
considering that policy has been eased substantially over the last year, that a number
of extraordinary liquidity measures have been put in place or are in train, and that
mortgage rates have already dropped appreciably in light of the Federal Reserves
recently announced program to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.
The Committee may wish to give the stimulus produced by the combination of all
these policies a chance to show its effects, while at the same time leaving open the
possibility of a further reduction in the target rate and the implementation of more
unconventional policy actions should macroeconomic conditions fail to improve.  A
reduction in the target rate to ½ percent that is matched by a comparable reduction in
the interest rate on excess reserves would likely cause federal funds to trade below the
new target.  Even so, the Committee may still want to set a target of ½ percent to
signal where it would want federal funds to trade once financial conditions begin to
improve, some Federal Reserve programs are unwound, and the amount of excess
reserves in the system returns to a more normal level.
","Alternative C"
2009-01-27,39,"(39) The description of the economic outlook in Alternative A highlights the
weaker-than-expected incoming data, and Alternatives A and B note that global
demand is slowing significantly.  Alternatives B and C state that the economic outlook
remains weak.  Alternative A announces either a $250 billion increase in the Federal
Reserves commitment to purchase mortgage-backed securities or the establishment
of a program to purchase $250 billion of longer-term Treasury securities.  Alternative
A also highlights the risk that inflation could persist below levels consistent with the
dual objectives of monetary policy; this language might help underscore the
Committees intent not to allow inflation to remain below its optimal level in the long
run and thus may help prevent an unwanted further decline in expectations of long-
run inflation.  This sentence also may be seen as signaling that the Committee would
adopt further stimulative measures should inflation continue to decline significantly.
Alternative B states that the Committee is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury
securities or to increase purchases of mortgage-backed securities, but makes no
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR) 37 of 52
specific commitment on the timing or amount of such purchases.  Alternatives A and
B state that the Committee will continue to assess whether expansions of or
modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and
economic activity.  Alternative C omits all mention of possible increases in open
market purchases or liquidity programs other than the TALF.
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR) 38 of 52
December FOMC Statement
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds 
rate of 0 to 1/4 percent.  
 
Since the Committee's last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data 
indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined.  
Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight.  Overall, the outlook for 
economic activity has weakened further. 
 
Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably.  In light of the declines in the prices 
of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee 
expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters. 
 
The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable 
economic growth and to preserve price stability.  In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak 
economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some 
time.  
 
The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial 
markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain 
the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.  As previously announced, over the 
next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-
backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to 
expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The 
Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  
Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve 
will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and 
economic activity.

2009-03-17,39,"(39) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committees
consideration, summarized by the draft statements on the following pages.
The draft statements for Alternatives A and B incorporate a new organizational
structure in which the statement begins not by referring to the federal funds rate
target but by characterizing the Committees outlook and then goes on to describe
the Federal Reserves policy strategy.  The draft statement for Alternative C uses
the same structure as in the January FOMC statement.   A somewhat different
approach to structuring these statements is discussed at the end of this section.
","Alternative C"
2008-10-28,40,"(40) If the Committee believes that the economic outlook has not deteriorated as
much as in the staff forecast or that there is still a significant risk that inflation will not
moderate as expected, it might prefer to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in
Alternative C.  Although recent readings on real activity have been very weak, a wide
range of monetary and other policy measures have been implemented recently, and
members may feel that a gradual improvement of financial conditions could be in
train.  Indeed, many yield spreads have been narrowing and liquidity measures have
been improving gradually in recent days, albeit from highly strained levels.  If this
process continues in coming weeks, the cumulative improvement in financial
conditions could be substantial.  Also, the Committee may place a high probability on
a major new fiscal stimulus package being enacted soon; no fiscal package was
factored into the staffs projection.  Moreover, members may be skeptical of the staff
projection of a sharp reduction in inflation, perhaps feeling that it is based on
assumptions that may prove to be overly optimistic.  For example, the Committee
may not have confidence in the sharply lower trajectory for energy prices suggested by
futures markets; energy prices are highly volatile and futures market quotes over the
past few years have been unreliable guides to subsequent developments.  And some
members may not put much stock in the notion that slack in labor and product
markets will restrain future price pressures, but may instead worry that a very low
funds rate will fuel rising inflation expectations, as illustrated in the Greenbooks
Faster Inflation scenario.  Indeed, members may want to see several months of
lower data on inflation and inflation expectations before they feel comfortable with
further reductions in the policy target.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 38 of 45
","Alternative C"
2008-12-15,40,"(40) As a third motivation for favoring Alternative C, members may view a
decision to reduce the target rate by 50 basis points as an intermediate step towards
reaching a level of rates closer to the zero bound at a later date.  Such an approach
would be consistent with the staffs assumption in the Greenbook projection, the
prescriptions of a number of policy rules, and the optimal control simulations with an
inflation target of either 1½ or 2 percent described in the monetary policy strategies
section of this Bluebook.   Even if members are not concerned that a sustained
environment of very low interest rates will be particularly harmful to certain financial
markets and institutions, they may still believe that making the move toward the zero
bound in two steps would be preferable on the grounds that it would allow market
participants more time to adjust to a world of near-zero interest rates.  In addition, the
Committee may feel that such a gradual approach would not be overly costly in terms
of its macroeconomic objectives since further monetary stimulus could be provided
through additional unconventional policy measures.  Finally, an inclination to ease
policy 50 basis points at this meeting might be reinforced by the fact that most market
participants appear to expect a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate, and
Committee members might be reluctant to inject further uncertainty into financial
markets at a time when markets remain extremely fragile.
","Alternative C"
2009-01-27,40,"(40) If the Committee agrees that current economic conditions are very weak but
suspects that there is a significant possibility that policy actions already announced or
likely to be adopted will have a larger effect on economic activity than is assumed in
the staffs forecast, it may wish to choose Alternative B.  In many ways, the current
circumstances are unprecedented, and we lack reliable metrics for gauging the
effectiveness of nontraditional policies.  In light of the aggressive monetary actions
already taken or announced and the large fiscal package likely to be passed, members
may believe that it is prudent at this stage to wait and assess further developments
before committing the Federal Reserve to any additional actions.  In particular,
members may wish to observe the market reaction to the implementation of the
TALF, planned for next month.  Moreover, the incoming administration may move
rapidly to ramp up efforts to deal with the financial crisis, and the Committee will be
better placed to assess these efforts in a few weeks.  Alternatively, members may be
concerned about the challenges of exiting from measures already adopted, and thus
may wish to be quite cautious in implementing further liquidity programs.  At the
same time, given that the forecasts of the staff and most private analysts imply that
additional macroeconomic stimulus would be desirable, the Committee may not want
to signal a halt to further monetary actions.  Alternative B states that additional
actions will be taken as needed, and so would allow the Committee to introduce new
policies quickly if it concluded that they were appropriate.
","Alternative B, Alternative B"
2009-03-17,40,"(40) All three alternatives maintain an unchanged target range of 0 to ¼ percent
for the federal funds rate and provide forward policy guidance; as in January,
Alternatives B and C indicate that the funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally
low for some time whereas Alternative A signals a somewhat longer duration
by substituting the phrase for an extended period.  All of the alternatives refer
to the recent launching of the TALF and note that the range of eligible collateral
for that program is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.  As in the
January statement, each alternative indicates that the Committee will continue to
monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserves balance sheet and will
assess whether lending facilities should be expanded or modified.
","Alternative A"
2008-10-28,41,"(41) The first part of the rationale portion of the statement associated with
Alternative C would acknowledge the recent deterioration in economic and financial
conditions.  The second part would point to the wide range of recent policy actions,
noting that they should help to promote growth over time.  The discussion of the
outlook for inflation would be essentially identical to that in the October 8 statement,
which focused on a reduction in upside risks rather than a material reduction in the
modal forecast.  Finally, the risk assessment under Alternative C begins by stating that
the balance of risks has shifted toward downside risks to growth.  The section
concludes with a modification of the risk assessment of the October 8 statement,
pointing to the possible effects of past policy actions as something the Committee will
be watching particularly closely.
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2008-12-15,41,"(41) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative C begins
by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by
pointing to deterioration in labor markets, household and business spending, and
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 60
industrial production.  The paragraph on inflation reiterates, as in October, that the
Committee expects inflation to moderate because of the weaker economic outlook
and the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, but also, as in
Alternatives A and B, that there are risks that inflation will fall to rates below those
that would best foster economic growth and price stability.  The next paragraph
makes clear that downside risks to the economy are the Committees primary concern
and indicates that the Committee will use all its available tools to promote the
resumption of economic growth and to preserve price stability.  This wording is
intended to leave the door open to, but not promise, a further reduction in the target
rate if conditions warrant, while at the same time making it clear that unconventional
policy actions are also available.  Some of these actions, including the possibility that
existing programs may be expanded or new programs may be implemented if
appropriate, are cited in the next paragraph.  If the Committee viewed Alternative C
as a stepping stone to an even lower target federal funds rate, it may wish to add a
sentence to signal more clearly to market participants that a further reduction in the
target rate may be forthcoming.  For example, the fourth paragraph of the statement
could conclude by saying that, The Committee will consider whether further
reductions in the target federal funds rate would be beneficial in light of evolving
circumstances.  On the other hand, if the Committee sees ½ percent as a floor below
which it is not likely to push the target rate, it may also wish to make its thinking more
explicit, for example by adding the clause Although the Committee believes that
further reductions in the target federal funds rate would not be beneficial on balance
immediately before the indication that the Committee will use all of its available tools
(which in this case would be referred to as all other available tools).  The statement
concludes with an acknowledgement that federal funds may trade below the target,
given the large amounts of excess reserves in the system.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 47 of 60
","Alternative C, Alternative C"
2009-01-27,41,"(41) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment that policies already
announced or expected will not suffice to prevent considerable economic slack and a
heightened risk of deflation, and if it believes that additional policy measures could
help to improve the economic outlook, it may opt for Alternative A.  The output gap
in the Greenbook remains larger than 5 percent over the next two years and core
inflation falls below 1 percent, which is lower than the rates of inflation that most
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 52
FOMC participants would view as consistent with the Federal Reserves dual
mandate.  Most private-sector analysts have marked up their forecasts for the
unemployment rate in 2009 and 2010 to levels about the same as projected by the
staff, and they forecast relatively low rates of inflation, albeit not as low as the staff.
Even if members have a less gloomy outlook for the economy, they may view the
downside risks to this outlook as unusually large and thus may wish to take out
insurance against an unwelcome further weakening in growth or drop in inflation.
The significant decline in long-term interest rates, including conventional mortgage
rates, since the Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase agency debt and MBS
may give policymakers confidence that nontraditional policies can provide significant
economic stimulus.  As a result, the Committee may conclude that an expansion of
these purchases would likely lead to further reductions in rates and increases in
mortgage availability.  Or, if the level of long-term interest rates is seen as higher than
is consistent with a rapid economic recovery, the Committee may wish to engage in
large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury securities.  By lowering the general level
of long-term interest rates, either of these options could support business and
household spending.
","Alternative A"
2009-03-17,41,"(41) In characterizing the outlook for economic activity, Alternatives A and B
indicate that the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that financial
conditions have generally worsened.  Both alternatives state that policy measures
to stabilize financial markets and institutions, along with stimulus from fiscal and
monetary policy, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic
growth, but neither alternative makes any specific reference to the timing of
economic recovery or to the balance of risks to the economic outlook.  In contrast,
Alternative C characterizes the incoming information as indicating that economic
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 35 of 60
activity has slowed further but follows the language of the January FOMC
statement in pointing to a gradual economic recovery starting later this year and
in noting significant downside risks to that outlook.
","Alternative C"
2008-10-28,42,"(42) Given the high odds embedded in financial market prices of at least a 25
basis point cut at this meeting, a decision to adopt Alternative C would surprise
market participants, leading to an appreciable upward revision of their short-term
outlook for the path of policy and probably an increase in short-and intermediate-
term interest rates.  Equity prices would likely fall, perhaps substantially.  Financial
market strains would probably increase and private yields would rise.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative C"
2008-12-15,42,"(42) Since most primary dealers see a 50 basis point policy easing as the most
likely outcome at this meeting, and since a majority see ½ percent as the trough for
the target federal funds rate this cycle, the market reaction to an announcement like
that for Alternative C is likely to be muted, with short-term interest rates, equity
prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all changing little.  The
movements in these variables may be a bit more pronounced if the Committee
decided to be more explicit regarding its proclivity to move the target rate lower in the
future because the uncertainty as to the floor for the target would be removed; any
such move, however, is not likely to be major, partly because market participants may
expect federal funds to trade quite soft to the target in any case.  As in Alternative B,
longer-term interest rates may decline a little, but probably not by much, because
investors may be somewhat surprised by the language on the use of the Federal
Reserves balance sheet as a means of further supporting credit markets and economic
","Alternative C, Alternative B"
2009-01-27,42,"(42) If the Committee has a relatively optimistic view of the underlying
economic situation and outlook, it may be inclined to favor Alternative C.  Members
may anticipate a more rapid unwinding of financial strains than assumed by the staff,
leading to a more pronounced rebound in activity (as in the Faster Recovery
alternative scenario in the Greenbook).  Such an outcome might be the result of a new
and aggressive approach by the incoming administration to the ongoing financial
crisis.  Alternatively, members may believe that the monetary policies and liquidity
facilities that already have been implemented or announced will provide greater
stimulus to economic activity than is built into the staff forecast.  Similarly, the
Committee may have a larger estimate of the fiscal multiplier than that assumed by the
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 52
staff in its analysis of the likely effects of the fiscal stimulus package.  Finally, as in
Alternative B, the Committee may be concerned that exiting from the existing
facilities could prove challenging and prefer not to take the risk of adding to such
difficulties.  Indeed, if the public came to view the expansion of the Federal Reserve
balance sheet as implying a permanent increase in the monetary base, inflation
expectations could increase, and inflation risk premiums in financial assets might rise
in a destabilizing manner.  The language in Alternative C makes clear that existing
Federal Reserve policies and programs are viewed by the Committee as helpful, but it
does not hint at any expansion of existing programs or the introduction of new
","Alternative C, Alternative B, Alternative C"
2009-03-17,42,"(42) Alternatives A and B indicate that inflation is likely to remain subdued
in light of the growing margin of economic slack here and abroad, and both
alternatives make note of the risk that inflation could remain persistently below rates
consistent with the dual mandate.  As in January, Alternative C refers to last falls
drop in energy and commodity prices and to prospects for considerable economic
slack as factors explaining the outlook for inflation, which is expected to remain
subdued in coming quarters before returning to rates consistent with the dual
mandate; this alternative does not give an assessment of risks to the inflation outlook.
","Alternative C"
2009-01-27,43,"(43) Based on interest rate futures contracts and on the Desks survey of dealers,
market participants attach virtually no probability to a change in the target range for
the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Dealers generally expect the statement to
continue to refer to the funds rate remaining low for some time and to focus on the
Federal Reserves nontraditional policy tools.  On average, dealers place the odds of
large-scale Federal Reserve purchases of long-term Treasury securities at about 50
percent, with no time horizon specified for the onset of such purchases.  Although
market expectations for the statement overall are difficult to judge, the message of
Alternative B seems most consistent with current market views.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","Alternative B"
2009-03-17,43,"(43) All three alternatives emphasize that the Federal Reserve will employ
all available tools for promoting economic recovery and preserving price stability,
but the alternatives differ regarding which new policy measures, if any, should be
initiated at this meeting.  Alternative A indicates that the Federal Reserves balance
sheet will be expanded further this year by the purchase of $500 billion in longer-term
Treasury securities and by the acquisition of an additional $500 billion of agency
mortgage-backed securities (MBS), bringing total MBS purchases to $1 trillion.12
Alternative B expands agency MBS purchases by $500 billion but does not initiate any
acquisition of Treasury notes or bonds; as in the January statement, this alternative
indicates that the Committee is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities
if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly
effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  Under Alternative C,
no new policy actions would be taken at this meeting; instead, as in January, this

alternative states that the Federal Reserve stands ready to expand its purchases of
agency debt and MBS and is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities
in light of evolving circumstances.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 37 of 60
January FOMC Statement
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds 
rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely 
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.
Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has 
weakened further.  Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to 
decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending.  Furthermore, global 
demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Conditions in some financial markets have 
improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial 
institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.  The 
Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but 
the downside risks to that outlook are significant.
In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the 
prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will 
remain subdued in coming quarters.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation 
could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the 
longer term.
The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable 
economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The focus of the Committee's policy is to 
support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market 
operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance 
sheet at a high level.  The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt 
and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it 
stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program 
as conditions warrant.  The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury 
securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly 
effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  The Federal Reserve will be 
implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit 
to households and small businesses.
The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal 
Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether 
expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets 
and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

The Case for Alternative B
","Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative A, Alternative B, Alternative C, Alternative B"
2008-12-15,44,"(44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D
acknowledges that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further and
that the near-term outlook has deteriorated.  However, the statement notes that the
Committee expects the recent policy measures to improve credit conditions and
promote a return to moderate growth over time.  To underscore that the Federal
Reserve has already taken concrete actions in response to the deterioration in the
outlook, the remaining part of that paragraph notes that the Federal Reserve will
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 49 of 60
purchase large amounts of agency and mortgage-backed securities and will implement
the TALF early next year.  The language on inflation remains unchanged from the
October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that
federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time.  The statement
concludes by noting that the Committee will monitor economic and financial

2009-03-17,44,"(44) If policymakers judge that the economy is undergoing a severe economic
contraction and that the subsequent recovery is likely to be feeble, and if they believe
that a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet would
provide additional monetary stimulus and thereby improve the economic outlook,
the Committee could decide at this meeting to expand its purchases of agency
MBS and to reiterate the possibility of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities
depending on evolving circumstances, as in Alternative B.  Incoming information
over the intermeeting period may have led policymakers to mark down their
projections for economic activity and inflation and hence to anticipate a deeper
recession and a weaker recoveryperhaps lasting five years or morein the absence
of any additional policy stimulus.  For example, the Greenbook-consistent measure of
short-run r* has fallen sharply since January and is now almost 4 percentage points
below the actual real federal funds rate, indicating that a substantial further increase
in the degree of policy stimulus would be required to close the output gap over
a three-year period.  This policy alternative might also be appealing to members
who already considered the economic outlook to be quite bleak in late January but
preferred at that time to postpone consideration of further monetary policy easing
until after Congress had approved the fiscal stimulus package and the administration
had announced its plans for stabilizing the financial system and the housing sector.
Even members whose modal forecast is more optimistic than that of the staff
might nonetheless believe that additional monetary stimulus would be appropriate
to provide impetus to the economy and to help alleviate the risk of an accelerating
feedback loop between financial conditions and economic activity that might lead to
even more severe macroeconomic outcomes.

","Alternative A, Alternative A"
2009-03-17,47,"(47) A number of distinct factors might motivate a decision not to initiate
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities at this meeting but to preserve
the option of pursuing such purchases at a later date.  Policymakers may be skeptical
that large-scale purchases of Treasury notes and bonds would be the most efficient
means of improving private sector credit conditions, especially in an environment of
elevated credit frictions and incomplete arbitrage across different financial markets.
Indeed, the Committee may see a substantial risk that purchases of longer-term
Treasury securities could have detrimental effects on financial market functioning,
perhaps by diminishing the value of Treasury notes and bonds as hedging vehicles.
Moreover, the Committee may be concerned that the Federal Reserves credibility
could be undermined if investors perceived this program as oriented towards
monetizing the federal debt rather than as a tool for preserving price stability and
promoting the resumption of sustainable economic growth; such a weakening of
Federal Reserve credibility could push up inflation risk premiums and thereby raise
the cost of longer-term credit for households and businesses.  Finally, the recently
announced expansion of the TALF is likely to increase the size of the Federal
Reserves balance sheet, and expanded purchases of agency MBS would generate a
substantial further increase in the size of the balance sheet that at some stage would
need to be reversed; thus, even if policymakers conclude that large-scale purchases
of Treasury notes and bonds would be helpful in providing additional economic
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 60
stimulus, they may prefer to hold off on initiating an even larger balance sheet
expansion at the current juncture.
The Case for Alternative A
","Alternative A"
2009-03-17,48,"(48) If policymakers judge that a substantially greater degree of monetary
stimulus is warranted to help promote a resumption of sustainable economic growth,
the Committee could decide at this meeting to initiate large-scale purchases of
$500 billion in longer-term Treasury securities and to expand purchases of
agency MBS, as in Alternative A.  Committee participants may concur that the
Federal Reserves current liquidity and credit facilities are crucial for stabilizing
the financial system and providing the prerequisites for economic recovery, but
they may nonetheless view the monetary and fiscal policy measures currently in train
as unlikely to foster an acceptably rapid pace for that recovery.  Indeed, in the absence
of any further macroeconomic stimulus, the Greenbook projects that in mid-2012
the unemployment rate will still be above 7 percent and the core inflation rate will be
less than ¾ percent.  As noted above, a $500 billion expansion in purchases of agency
MBS could be helpful in improving that outlook but still would not be likely to bring
the economy to its potential even after five years.  Moreover, participants projections
for economic activity and inflation might be considerably worse than that of the
Greenbook if they anticipate that credit market frictions are likely to generate
further sharp declines in spending and employment in coming quarters, as in the
Greenbooks Intensifying Financial Strains scenario, and hence they might see an
even stronger rationale for providing additional monetary stimulus to the economy.
","Alternative A"
2008-12-15,49,"(49) If the Committee wants to keep a target for the federal funds rate of either
½ percent as in Alternative C or 1 percent as in Alternative D, and agrees that the
options available to drain reserves from the system and enable the Desk to meet the
target are either unlikely to materialize or are likely to be otherwise undesirable, it may
wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not
expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances.  The Committee may
wish to include in the directive a sentence similar to that in the public statements that
will accompany the policy decisions and explicitly indicate that it recognizes that the
federal funds rate may tend to trade below the new target.  If it were to choose
Alternative C, the Committee may also want to direct the Desk to purchase
$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed
MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next
year to provide a more specific time frame than the several quarters indicated in the
November 25 press release.  Such a directive is not included under Alternative D
because if the Committee were optimistic enough about the outlook to select that
alternative, it might not want the desk to complete the full amount of the announced

2008-12-15,50,"(50) Under Alternative B, the Committee would direct the Desk to seek
conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to

guaranteed MBS over the next intermeeting period, but to leave the Desk ample
latitude to vary the timing and pace of such purchases depending on conditions in the
market for such securities and on broader mortgage market and housing sector
conditions.  The Committee may want to reiterate the limits that have already been
announced for such purchases.

","Alternative B"
2008-12-15,51,"(51) If the Committee decides not to set a target at all, as in Alternative A, it
could specify to the Desk that it has suspended setting a target and that it anticipates
that the reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the
liquidity programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates
near zero.  It may also direct the desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed
MBS over the next intermeeting period, as under Alternative B, and subject to the
same limits.
","Alternative A, Alternative B"
2009-03-17,51,"(51) In an environment of exceptionally high uncertainty, policymakers may
judge that Alternative A provides the most appropriate balance between downside
risks to the economic outlook over the next several years and the risk that excessive
expansion of the Federal Reserves balance sheet could hamper the conduct of
monetary policy at longer horizons.  Members may interpret recent data as providing
a strengthened rationale for taking further action to alleviate downside risks to
economic activity and price stability.  For example, with the trajectory for core
inflation now expected to be even lower over the next few years, participants
may perceive a greater risk that the longer-run inflation expectations of households
and businesses could drift downward over time, as in the Greenbooks Deflation
scenario.  Indeed, as discussed in the box on Extracting Deflation Probabilities
from TIPS, investors evidently perceive a significant probability that the price level
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 48 of 60
will decline over the next five years; a substantial increase in monetary stimulus
might help ameliorate those concerns.  Moreover, to the extent that the
extraordinarily high level of corporate bond spreads reflects investors worries
about an even steeper macroeconomic downturn, participants may conclude that
expanding agency MBS purchases and initiating purchases of longer-term Treasury
securities could reduce these spreads by reassuring investors about the economic
outlook.  Finally, policymakers may be reasonably optimistic about the prospects
for receiving new tools for managing the Federal Reserves balance sheet and hence
they may be comfortable that a further sizable expansion in the balance sheet would
not pose significant risks in terms of imposing constraints on the future conduct of
monetary policy.

growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee has
established a target for the federal funds rate of ½ percent.  In view of the large

2009-03-17,52,"(52) If policymakers anticipate a more robust economic recovery than in the
staff outlook and perceive that further expansion in the size of the Federal Reserves
balance sheet would be associated with substantial risks to the future conduct of
monetary policy, they may prefer not to initiate any new policy measures at this
meeting, as in Alternative C.  Committee participants may foresee that government
actions to stabilize the financial system, together with the monetary and fiscal policies
already in train, are likely to foster a stronger pace of economic activity later this year
and in 2010, as in the Greenbooks Faster Recovery scenario.  Participants may also
judge that some portion of the current economic downturn reflects a falloff in trend
productivity growth, perhaps reflecting the costs of adjustment associated with
sectoral reallocation of capital and labor, as in the Greenbooks More Adverse
Supply Conditions scenario; in that case, the extent of economic slack would be
substantially smaller than in the staff projection, and inflation could stay much closer
to rates judged to be consistent with the dual mandate.  Even if policymakers see the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 49 of 60
economy as likely to follow a trajectory similar to that of the staff projection, they
may see fiscal policy as the most appropriate tool for providing additional stimulus.
Finally, policymakers may be particularly concerned about the risk that constraints
arising from the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet could constrain the
future conduct of monetary policy; if so, they may be reluctant to adopt measures
that would further expand its assets and liabilities, at least until the Federal Reserve
receives new tools for managing the size and composition of its balance sheet.

Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/USthe staffs large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economydepend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the models exogenous variables.
Greenbook-
consistent
The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term differenceprojected at 40 basis 
pointsbetween total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.
