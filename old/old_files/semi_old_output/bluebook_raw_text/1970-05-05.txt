MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) Both the money supply and the adjusted bank credit proxy

have grown at a faster pace from March to April on average than was

indicated as consistent with the target path adopted at the last FOMC

meeting. At present, the money supply is estimated to have increased

in April at a 12.5 per cent annual rate, compared with a 4.0 per cent

rate specified earlier. And the average annual rate of growth of the

adjusted proxy for the month is estimated at about 14 per cent, compared

with a rate of 8 per cent indicated earlier.

(2) The greater strength in the money supply resulted mainly

from a private demand deposit bulge at the end of March--partly reflecting

statistical aberrations--that turned out to be larger than estimated on

the basis of preliminary data available at the previous FOMC meeting.

Subsequently, more than two-thirds of the bulge eroded, but this was not

quite as rapid a pace as earlier anticipated. The higher average level

of the money supply also appeared to be related to a larger than expected

demand for cash balances (for more detail see paragraph (7)). Time deposits

appeared to be growing more than expected in early April, but around

mid-month time deposit growth showed a pronounced slowing reflecting

in part the recent rise in short-term interest rates. Treasury



bill rates (on an investment yield basis) generally moved

back above ceiling rates on large CD's in the latter part of the

month. Growth in deposits was associated, on the asset side of

bank balance sheets, with bank financing of an advanced level

of Government securities dealers' Treasury bill positions in late

March and early April and in bank acquisitions of municipal

securities.

money supply and adjusted bank credit proxy paths were running ahead



-3-

of the desired patterns for April and also, though to a lesser extent,

for the second quarter as a whole (which was taken to be midway between

the paths of alternatives A and B in the previous blue book). Conse-

quently, the Desk moved toward achieving a somewhat firmer atmosphere

in the money market. Over the 4 statement weeks ending April 29, the

Federal funds rate averaged about 8-1/8 per cent, compared with an

average of 7-3/4 per cent in the preceding 4-week period. Dealer loan

rates rose commensurately to 9 per cent or above. Over the same period

weekly average net borrowed reserves fluctuated in a wide $300-$950 million

range, while average member bank borrowings ranged between about $500

million and $1 billion--but toward the upper end of these ranges in the

later weeks of the period. As money market conditions tightened, both

the adjusted credit proxy and the money supply moved back toward the

April 7 target path, as can be seen (in the table above) from the

narrowing differences as the month progressed between current estimates

and target levels.

(4) The increase in the cost of day-to-day funds came at

a time when dealer bill inventories were very large and when market

demands for bills were not strengthening as much as expected. Moreover,

the market interpreted the rise in day-to-day financing rates as indicat-

ing that the System's concern with monetary aggregates might lead to

tighter credit conditions than had been earlier anticipated. Under

these circumstances, and with the outlook for the economy also appear-

ing a little stronger and fiscal policy seeming to shift toward less

restraint, dealers sought aggressively to lighten their positions.



Treasury bill rates adjusted sharply higher; the 3-month Treasury bill,

for example, was most recently bid around 6.85 per cent, some 40 basis

points higher than its April 7 level, while the 6-month and 1-year

bills were about 7.20 per cent, representing a rise of around 8C-90

basis points.

(5) Long-term market interest rates since early April have

risen under the influences noted above combined with a continuing

record volume of new issues. Yields on corporate,municipal and long-

term U.S. Government securities are now close to their 1969 highs.

The upward adjustment in yields in the Treasury coupon market also

reflected anticipation of the Treasury refunding of about $5 billion

of publicly-held mid-May maturing issues at a time when the market

was somewhat uncertain as to the meaning of "even keel". The Treasury

announced a "rights" exchange into two outstanding intermediate-term

issues--one maturing in three years (and priced to yield 7.98 per cent)

and the other in just under seven years (yielding 8 per cent)--plus

a simultaneous cash offering of $3-1/2 billion of a 7-3/4 per cent

18-month note, priced to yield almost 7.80 per cent. The short note

is being offered with 50 per cent tax and loan credit.

Prospective Developments

(7) If the Committee wishes to continue on the policy course

adopted at the previous meeting, it may wish to renew the second para-

graph of the directive issued then, with certain modifications, as

follows:

To implement this policy, the Committee desires

to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over

the months ahead. System open market operations until

the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted

with a view to maintaining BANK RESERVES AND money

market conditions consistent with that objective, tak-

ing account of the CURRENT [DEL:forthcoming] Treasury

financing.

Moderate growth in money and bank credit at the last meeting of the

Committee appeared to encompass an annual rate of increase for the

money stock of around 3 per cent over the second quarter and a 5-1/2

per cent annual rate of growth for the adjusted bank credit proxy--

although comments at the Committee meeting indicated that a reasonable

range of variation around such a growth path was tolerable. Develop-

ments since the last meeting of the Committee suggest that the demand

for money in the second quarter, at the given prospective growth in

GNP, may have been underestimated. If so, the interrelationships among

money growth, interest rates, and bank credit expansion contemplated



-7-

at the time of the previous meeting may not be mutually consistent--but,

in view of short-run instabilities in financial flows, it is extremely

difficult to evaluate how permanent emerging relationships may prove to

be. Money demand may be larger than assumed partly because of greater

demands for precautionary balances on the part of the public in an

uncertain financial market atmosphere, particularly as reflected in the

stock market, and perhaps, as the quarter progresses,because of greater

transitory holdings of cash balances as a result of the Government pay

raise and retroactive social security payments to the public.

(8) If in fact the demand for money is stronger than previously

assumed, maintenance of the April 7 target path for money for the second

quarter would imply higher interest rates and,therefore, smaller bank

credit expansion than targeted on April 7. Conversely, maintenance

of the April 7 target path for bank credit would imply more rapid

growth in money and lower levels of interest rates. Given below for

Committee consideration is an adjusted set of target paths which

compromises between these alternatives by allowing for somewhat

greater growth in money and somewhat slower growth in bank credit

than called for at the April 7 meeting.

Edge corporations reduced cash items and thus raised the reported money
supply. June will not include such a period. An adjustment to remove the
resulting bias in the rate of change over the second quarter would add about
1 percentage point to the quarterly rates shown in table.

(9) The adjusted pattern shown in the paragraph above allows

for greater money stock growth over the quarter as a whole than earlier.

But in May and June money stock growth drops off sharply, partly in

reflection of the reduction in outstanding money stock that has been

occurring over the course of April as the late March bulge has been

worked off and, in June, partly because of a rise in U.S. Government

deposits. In contrast to somewhat greater growth in the money stock

over the quarter, the adjusted bank credit proxy rises 1-1/2 percentage

points less than specified earlier. This growth rate for the proxy

assumes that Treasury bill rates decline from current advanced levels

into a range of about 6-1/2 -- 6-3/4 per cent for the 3-month bill between

now and mid-year. It is conceivable that the 3-month bill rate might drop

temporarily lower in this interval because of transitory supply scarcities,

but it is likely that longer bill rates would not decline as much as short

rates over the period ahead since that area of the market will be influenced

by the $3-1/2 billion of 18 month notes being offered for cash by the

Treasury.

(10) A weekly path for the May monetary aggregates consistent

with the monthly "adjusted path" shown in paragraph (8) would be as

follows:

27 307.9 205.0 199.2 27.7

eJ Estimated from partial data.

(11) The weekly pattern shown above assumes that "even Keel"

considerations will be important until the mid-May settlement date for

the Treasury financing. Thus, the Federal funds rate is expected to

remain in the 8 to 8-1/2 per cent range that has prevailed recently.

After the even keel period, somewhat more fluctuation in the Federal

funds rate may be expected, perhaps in a 7 to 9 per cent range, as the

Desk reacts to possible off-target developments in the monetary aggregates.

Net borrowed reserves may fluctuate widely in an $0.5 to $1.0 billion

range, with member bank borrowing in a $0.6 to $1.1 billion range.



-10-

(12) The weekly behavior of the monetary aggregates and

money market conditions subsequent to the even keel period will depend

heavily on the results of the Treasury financing. The weekly path of

aggregates shown in paragraph (10) assumes an attrition of $2.5 billion

(or a shade above 50 per cent); net new cash borrowing by the Treasury,

therefore, would amount to $1.0 billion. If the attrition is larger and

the Treasury obtains less new cash than estimated, a different weekly

pattern in the path of the aggregates would be likely, with money supply

perhaps strengthening as Government deposits increase less than expected,

(13) Time deposit growth over the quarter is likely to be

significantly slower than contemplated four weeks ago. The rate of

increase in such deposits would be expected to diminish sharply to about

a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate in May and June from the rapid 18 per cent

March-April rate. Banks would not be able to attract much in the way

of additional domestic CD money at the interest rate levels noted above.

Consumer-type time deposits are still likely to be a source of funds,

but growth is estimated to be modest in light of the need to pay for the

AT&T issue and in view of the competition from the new 18-month Treasury

cash issue (which is sold in minimum denominations of $1,000). The

time deposit pattern implicit in the target path for bank credit suggested

in paragraph (8) is shown below:

March 194.3 14.4
April 197.8 21.5

Second Quarter 11

(14) With time deposit growth more constrained, banks once

again will probably be adding to nondeposit sources of funds--perhaps at

around a $100 million per week rate for Euro-dollar and commercial paper

taken together. Since these are relatively costly funds, however, the

extent to which they will in fact add to such borrowings would appear to

depend heavily on loan demands. Loan growth is assumed to strengthen

from the relatively weak pattern indicated for March and April partly

because the 8 per cent prime rate has become relatively more attractive

to borrowers.

(15) Given the adjusted pattern of monetary aggregates, it

is likely that the pressure of credit demand in long-term markets will

keep bond yields at relatively advanced levels through mid-year. Recep-

tion of the Treasury financing will be an important factor affecting

credit markets; for instance, an unusually strong aversion to the longer

options in the exchange would suggest that even current market rates are

not sustainable. On the other hand, once the AT&T offering is settled

and the Treasury financing is digested, there may be room for longer-term

rates to edge down, particularly if some of the recent pressures in short-

term markets abate and banks are not inhibited from active participation

in the municipal securities markets.
