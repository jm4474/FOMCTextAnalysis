MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Pressures have moderated considerably in a number of

financial markets since the last meeting of the Committee. In long-

term credit markets, yields on newly-issued corporate bonds, State

and local securities, and U.S. Treasury bond yields have declined by

about 40-70 basis points. Most recently, however, there have been

some signs of hesitation in this bond market rally. Also, investors

are behaving quite selectively in regard to the quality of bond issues,

and spreads between the highest rated and lower rated issues have

increased.

(2) In short-term markets, Treasury bill rates have dropped

below levels prevailing in the first three weeks of June. The 3-month

bill has generally fluctuated around 6-1/2 per cent since the last

Committee meeting, but was most recently quoted at 6.40 per cent.

Commercial paper rates, on the other hand, have tended to edge upwards,

reflecting the fall-off of investor confidence in some large paper

issuers. There was, more notably, a diminished availability of credit

in this market, with outstanding nonbank-related paper declining by

over $2 billion, or considerably more than seasonally, in the week

ending July 1 and showing only a very minor recovery in the ensuing



-2-

week. Much of the liquidation of outstanding commercial paper was

financed out of bank loans. At all weekly reporting banks, in the two

weeks ending July 8 loans rose by $2.5 billion (all of this increase

occurred in the week ending July 1 and was concentrated in loans to

finance companies and businesses), and the volume of large-denomination

CD's expanded by $2.2 billion, mainly in the 30-89 day maturity area for

which rate ceilings have been suspended. Credit availability in the

commercial paper market appears to have improved in recent days; in

general, banks have demonstrated that they are willing to stand behind

commercial paper borrowers, by actually extending credit and by granting

additional bank lines. However, the practice of differential pricing

is spreading, and investors continue to be selective. Thus further net

attrition remains possible, though it probably will not be of end-of-

June dimensions.

(3) With the need for bank financing enlarged by the actual

and potential attrition of commercial paper, bank deposits grew more

rapidly than earlier projected in the two statement weeks ending July 8,

mainly as a result of a faster-than-expected rise in CD's. While

money supply and private demand deposit growth in late June and early

July was also substantially faster than anticipated, partial data

suggest that the rate of growth subsided in the statement week just

past and that the outstanding money supply in that week may be back

to the level projected at the time of the last FOMC meeting.

The churning associated with commercial paper market uncertainties



-3-

may have been partly responsible for the apparently temporary bulge

in the money supply; also there was a larger-than-seasonal drop in

overnight Euro-dollar borrowings by U.S. commercial banks (which

affected "cash items") around the end of the fiscal year. Reflecting

these various influences, rates of increase for the money supply and

bank credit in July are now projected to be considerably above those

contemplated on the assumption of unchanged money market conditions at

the time of the last FOMC meeting--even though the faster-than-expected

rise in time deposits has been partially offset by a decline in use of

non-deposit sources of funds.

1- Projections were based on an assumption of no change in money market
conditions and allowed for the suspension of ceiling rates on 30-89
day CD's.

(4) The recent moderation of overall financial pressures was

facilitated not only by expansion of bank credit but also by a related

reduction in the Federal funds rate to a weekly average level around

lllll IF



-5-

7-1/4--7-3/8 per cent during the three weeks ending July 8. In the week

ending July 15, however, the Federal funds rate backed up to a 7-1/2 to

7-3/4 per cent range, and large System repurchase agreements were made

during that week to keep it from moving even higher. During the two

weeks ending on July 1, the lower level of the Federal funds rate was

accompanied by net borrowed reserves that averaged around $940 million.

During the two weeks ending July 15, however, member bank borrowing

increased by $550 million to an average of $1.5 billion, with borrowings

highest in the most recent statement week; and net borrowed reserves

increased by around $600 million to $1.4 billion. The rise in borrowings

was related chiefly to emergency discount window accommodation of

banks lending to previous issuers of commercial paper; reports

indicate that average bank borrowings of about $400 million were for

such purposes during the past two statement weeks. Because of this

special discount window assistance, there was no additional pressure

on the Federal funds rate in the initial days as borrowings built up.

But as borrowings were sustained at a high and rising level, pressures

on the Federal funds rate did increase, although the funds rate has

remained low relative to the level of member bank borrowings as com-

pared with experience earlier in the year.

Prospective developments

(6) Of the three financial markets which were of concern to

the Committee in its last two meetings--the stock, bond, and commercial

paper markets--pressures have abated on the first two but problems

remain in the commercial paper market. In view of the continued

pressure on profits and on liquidity in some areas, difficulties could

arise in credit markets which cannot be foreseen at the moment--for

example, if a large industrial or financial concern were to be forced

into bankruptcy. Thus, it would appear reasonable for the FOMC to con-

tinue to show some concern for the possible emergence of undue pressures

on financial markets, although conditions at the moment do not seem to

necessitate the degree of concern shown in the last two FOMC directives.

In general, during the past few weeks, credit market conditions appear

to have improved enough for the FOMC, if it wishes, to return to the

type of emphasis on monetary aggregates that was contained in the

directives issued in March and April.

(7) Of the two alternatives shown below for the second

paragraph, alternative A calls for continuing the same degree of con-

cern with financial markets as the previous two directives. Alterna-

tive B calls for giving more emphasis to monetary aggregates in day-

to-day open market operations, while providing for modifications in

case excessive pressures on financial markets develop. Both directives

take account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, to be announced on

July 29, of $5-1/2 billion of publicly-held coupon issues maturing

August 15.



Alternative A

"To implement this policy, in view of persisting market

uncertainties and [DEL: liquidity strains] TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING, open market operations until

the next meeting of the Committee shall continue to be con-

ducted with a view to moderating pressures on financial

markets. To the extent compatible therewith, the bank

reserves and money market conditions maintained shall be

consistent with the Committee's longer-run objective of

moderate growth in money and bank credit, ALLOWING FOR taking

[DEL: account of the Board's regulatory action affective June-24

and some] A possible CONTINUED [DEL: consequent] shifting of credit

flows from market to banking channels."

Alternative B

"To implement this policy, [DEL: in view of persisting market

uncertainties and liquidity strains;] THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO

PROMOTE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONEY AND BANK CREDIT OVER THE

MONTHS AHEAD, ALLOWING FOR A POSSIBLE CONTINUED SHIFT OF CREDIT

FLOWS FROM MARKET TO BANKING CHANNELS. SYSTEM open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall een-

tinue-to be conducted with a view to [DEL: moderating pressures on

financial markets. To the extent compatible therewith; the]

MAINTAINING bank reserves and money market conditions [DEL:maintained

shall be consistent with THAT the committee's longer run objective],



of moderate growth in money and bank credit;] taking account of

the FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT

OPERATIONS SHALL BE MODIFIED AS NEEDED TO COUNTER EXCESSIVE

PRESSURES IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, SHOULD THEY DEVELOP [DEL: Board'

regulatory action effective June 24 and some possible conse-

quent shifting of credi flows from markets to banking channels."]

(8) Only one set of interrelationships among monetary

aggregates, money market conditions, and interest rates more broadly

is discussed in the analysis that follows. This set can be considered

as consistent with either alternative A or B since, so far as the staff

can judge now, money market conditions similar to those recently pre-

vailing might be accompanied by a moderate growth in the money supply

and no strong upward pressure on interest rates. The maintenance of

money market conditions on a fairly even plane will need to condition

open market operations in any event in view of the large Treasury

financing that will be in the market during much of the inter-meeting

period. The practical difference between the two alternatives would

be in reactions of the Desk to misses in the aggregates. Under

alternative B, the Desk would be freer to react--though equally

subject to "even-keel" considerations as in alternative A--should the

aggregates be deviating from the indicated path, or from whatever

modification of it the Committee may wish to make.

(9) The table below shows a growth path for monetary

aggregates in which the money supply grows at a 5 per cent annual

rate over the course of the third quarter and the adjusted bank credit

proxy at a 14 per cent annual rate.

1/ The daily average for the quarter of the outstanding money stock in the
third quarter would be 4-1/2 per cent above that for the second quarter at
an annual rate. Similar figures for the first and second quarters are 2.6
and 6 per cent, respectively.

(10) The relatively rapid expansion in the adjusted bank credit

proxy reflects continued sizable growth in large CD's, and hence in time

deposits as a whole. Time deposits are expected to rise at about a 30 per

cent annual rate in July, but the rate of expansion should slow down as

banks work through their initial adjustment to the increased availability

of short-term CD's and as the need for additional financing of commercial

paper market attrition subsides. Banks are expected to continue to

receive fairly sizable net inflows of other time and savings deposits, if

their good experience during the recent midyear interest crediting period

is any guide. Over the quarter as a whole total time and savings deposits

are expected to rise at a 25 per cent annual rate, but such deposits

other than large CD's may rise at only about half that pace, which would be

just a little more rapidly than in the second quarter. It is expected



-11-

that banks will substitute some of these expanded time deposits flows for

non-deposit sources, thus probably resulting in at least some small net

pay-down. This contributes to the considerably slower rate of growth

for the credit proxy than for time deposits over the quarter.

(11) Money supply growth is likely to taper off in the period

ahead as financial markets remain generally calm and as U.S. Government

deposits rise. The annual rate of increase in August and September is

expected to drop to around 2 per cent, reflecting in part some further

adjustment in cash balances following the recent midyear surge.

(12) A weekly path for the monetary aggregates consistent with

the monthly figures is shown below (daily average levels, seas. adj. in

billions of dollars):

Week ending Adjusted Credit Proxy Money Supply Total Reserves

July 15 e /  314.4 205.4 28.4
July 22 315.5 206.0 28.2
July 29 317.9 205.8 28.2

August 12 318.7 205.7 28.5
August 19 318.6 206.7 28.5

e/ Partly estimated.

(13) In the period ahead money market conditions are likely

to encompass a Federal funds rate generally in fairly wide 7-1/4--7-3/4

per cent range. Increased day-to-day financing demands associated with

the forthcoming Treasury refunding, and with the most recent Treasury tax

bill financing, will exert upward pressure on the funds rate. It is

difficult at this point to predict bank demands for borrowings--and

therefore pressures on the Federal funds market associated with any given



-12-

level of borrowings--in view of uncertainties afflicting the commercial

paper market, but we would expect some diminution of borrowing demands

from recent levels. Member bank borrowings may move back closer to $1

billion, on average, with the Federal funds rate in the range noted

above. Net borrowed reserves are likely to fluctuate around $900 million.

(14) The 3-month Treasury bill rate may be in a 6-1/4--6-5/8

per cent range over the next four weeks. Over the short-run, the bill

rate could be on the low side as a result of technical factors. Dealer

bill positions are not large and are relatively low in short bills. In

addition, there could be an enlarged demand for bills from holders of

maturing Treasury securities who do not opt for the exchange. On the

other hand, the Treasury is likely to need about $4 billion of new cash

by late August or early September, some of which might be raised in

the bill area, and some of which could be raised in connection with the

August refunding. Moreover, if, as suggested in paragraph (9), growth

in money and bank deposits slows as the summer progresses; this may

lead to diminished demand for bills. However, should GNP turn out to

be weaker than projected for the third quarter, bill rates could remain

on the low side in reflection of reduced credit demands from other

sectors of the economy.

(15) Over the longer run--between now and early next year--we

would expect bond yields to decline significantly further as the rate of

inflation moderates. In the period immediately ahead, though, such



-13-

interest rates could level off or even rise a bit, in a technical reaction

to the large recent yield declines and as the volume of new corporate

and State and local Government securities coming to market remains

large in a period when the Treasury is engaged in a sizable refunding.

However, if loan demands on banks were to weaken over the next few

weeks, banks may be in a position to place more of their funds in

securities, which could help both the Government and municipal market

and lead to an improved tone for corporate offerings.
