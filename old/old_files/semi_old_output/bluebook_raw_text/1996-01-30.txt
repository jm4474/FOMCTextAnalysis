MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) At the conclusion of its meeting on December 19, the FOMC

announced a slight easing of reserve market conditions, trimming the

federal funds rate from 5-3/4 percent to 5-1/2 percent. In implement-

ing that policy over the intermeeting period, Desk operations were

complicated by large swings in reserve demands associated with the

year-end and in reserve supplies stemming from variations in the Trea-

sury cash balance and the effects of foul winter weather on float. 1

As a consequence, the federal funds rate was volatile at times,

although it averaged close to its intended level. 2

(2) Most market interest rates have fallen 15 to 35 basis

points, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting, with a portion of

that decline following on the heels of the Committee's action. As the

intermeeting period unfolded, the expectation of fiscal restraint, the

soft tone of anecdotal information and of some of the limited official

data releases, and renewed concerns about the vigor of the expansion

in several of our major trading partners apparently led many analysts

to trim their assessment of the near-term prospects for spending. In

reflection of this revised outlook, market participants seem to have

built in a greater degree of easing in Federal Reserve policy in com-

ing months, judging from futures rates (chart). In capital markets,

1. The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, kept un-
changed in the days immediately following the FOMC meeting, was even-
tually reduced $25 million, to $50 million, to take account of the
seasonal downturn in borrowing. Firm reserve market conditions at
times and technical problems at a money-center bank pushed borrowing
well above its allowance on average over the intermeeting period.

2. Volatility in the funds market has been damped in the current
maintenance period, despite a decline in required operating balances
to levels last seen in the turbulent episode of early 1991.

the largest decline in one-year forward rates for Treasury securities,

about 35 basis points, was posted at one- to five-year maturities

(chart). Market prices proved sensitive to the give and take of the

debate on the budget in Washington. At times, bond yields approached

two-year lows as investors anticipated the possibility of an agreement

that would bring the budget into balance early in the next decade--or

at least considerable near-term fiscal restraint when the economy

already might be softening. Although the Secretary of the Treasury

has warned that he will run out of room to borrow no later than

March 1, financial markets are placing almost no weight on the pos-

sibility of default. Most major equity indexes rose 2 to 3-1/2 per-

cent over the intermeeting period.

(3) Despite the decline in U.S. interest rates, the dollar's

weighted-average exchange value rose a little more than 3 percent over

the intermeeting period. Upward movements against European currencies

were associated with even larger decreases in most interest rates

there than in the United States, owing to increasing signs of weaken-

ing economic growth and related expectations of monetary easing.

Interest rates in Japan generally rose in anticipation of economic

recovery, but the dollar nonetheless appreciated against the yen on

further signs of a narrowing of U.S. and Japanese current account im-

balances.

; the Desk did not intervene.

(4) Incoming information suggests that the expansion of debt

slowed in recent months, with total debt growing at an average annual

rate of only 3-3/4 percent over the final two months of 1995.3 The

deceleration owed primarily to net federal debt, which did not in-

crease on a seasonally adjusted basis, in part because, in order to

deal with debt-ceiling constraints, the Treasury relied more on run-

ning down its cash balance than seasonal norms and because spending

was held down by restrictive continuing resolutions. Growth of debt

of nonfederal sectors in recent months remained on the slow track

established around mid-year. Nonetheless, households continued to

borrow at a brisk pace, despite rising debt-service burdens and delin-

quency rates. Capital market issuance held steady, in part as some

corporations took advantage of lower market rates to fund longer term

and replace bank debt. There were a few indications that obtaining

credit might be getting harder--or at least that the trend toward

greater availability is coming to an end: Several bank loan officers

reported recently that lending standards had been tightened for both

consumer and business borrowers. However, borrowing terms remained

attractive, with spreads narrow in the market and still being eased at

banks, although not as aggressively.

(5) Preliminary data suggest that bank credit growth has

picked up noticeably in January from the sluggish pace that marked the

closing months of 1995, even as banks lightened their holdings of

government securities and securitized some of their loans. In par-

ticular, the growth of total loans has picked up briskly this month,

pulled along by strength in the business and consumer categories.

With bank credit reviving, M3 also staged a comeback, growing at rates

of 4-1/4 and 8-1/4 percent, respectively, in December and January.4

4. The monetary data in this bluebook incorporate new benchmarks
and seasonal adjustments, as well as a minor, technical redefinition
of M2. Overnight Eurodollar and overnight wholesale RPs have been
shifted from M2 to non-M2 M3. An appendix provides more detail on the
new benchmarks and seasonal adjustments.



-4-

On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, M3 increased at a 6 per-

cent rate, placing it at the upper bound of its 2-to-6 percent annual

range.

(6) The expansion of M2, at a rate of 5-1/2 percent over the

last two months, picked up a bit relative both to the sluggish pace of

the fall and to staff expectations at the time of the December FOMC

meeting. Further declines in money market rates compared with slug-

gishly adjusting rates on deposits and money market funds and the

flatness of the term structure appear to have made M2 assets rela-

tively more attractive. Some of the growth in M2 came at the expense

of bond mutual funds, which continued to post light inflows, and,

perhaps, at the expense of direct investment in securities, although

information on such portfolio flows is scant.5 All told, M2 in the

fourth quarter was 4-1/4 percent above its level in the fourth quarter

of 1994, in the upper portion on its 2-to-5 percent annual range, and

its velocity, although most likely edging higher in the fourth

quarter, was flat on the year.

(7) M1 continues to run off, contracting at rates of 4-1/2

and 6-1/2 percent in December and January, respectively. 6 Programs

to sweep funds from OCDs to avoid reserve requirements have spread

further, serving to trim about 12-1/4 percentage points from average

growth rates of the aggregate in the past two months.7 Currency

5. Preliminary indications suggest that M2 plus stock and bond
mutual funds expanded at rates of 9 and 5-1/4 percent, respectively,
in December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1994 to the
fourth quarter of last year, this measure expanded at a 7-1/2 percent
rate, with about 3-1/2 percentage points of this increase representing
the effects of capital gains.

6. In December and January, the monetary base expanded at an
average rate of 3-1/2 percent, while total reserves declined at an
8-3/4 percent rate.

7. Adjusted for retail sweeps, the monetary base expanded at an
average rate of 6-3/4 percent over the past two months, while total
reserves rose at a 15-1/2 percent rate.



-5-

growth, however, revived some, in part owing to a stirring in foreign

demands in December. Demand deposits grew at about a 10 percent rate

on average over the past two months, partly as the pickup in mortgage

activity induced some temporary flows through those accounts. For

1995, M1 contracted 1-3/4 percent, but absent retail sweeps it would

have expanded 1-1/2 percent based on initial amounts swept.

Long-Run Scenarios

(8) This section considers the implications of alternative

long-run strategies for monetary policy and highlights several risks

to the staff's assessment of economic prospects. The first set of

scenarios examines two alternative strategies with different economic

outcomes that the Committee might pursue. The baseline strategy

begins with the Greenbook's projection for 1996 and 1997 and there-

after keeps inflation steady at about 3 percent. The tighter strategy

extends the higher funds rate scenario of the Greenbook, with the

objective of attaining price stability shortly after the turn of the

decade. 8

(9) Both the baseline and tighter scenarios embody the same

underlying assumptions concerning macroeconomic forces and relation-

ships. With regard to fiscal policy, both assume no further progress

in reducing the federal deficit through the seven-year simulation

period.10 Also in both simulations, the natural rate of unemploy-

ment is assumed to be 5-3/4 percent. In light of the various uncer-

tainties associated with any forecasting exercise, the results re-

ported below should be read only as suggestive of the general patterns

likely to be engendered by each of the alternatives.

8. An easier strategy is not presented because, with the Greenbook
baseline of unemployment staying near its natural rate and inflation
remaining at 3 percent, the policy objectives associated with such a
strategy are unclear. If the outlook in the Greenbook is not viewed
as likely, then a lower path for the funds rate could be consistent
with the Committee's objectives. Below, in examining risks to the
Greenbook forecast, we consider the implications of alternative
outlooks for aggregate demand and supply.

9. The baseline forecast was extended beyond the horizon of the
Greenbook by judgmental assessment of long-run macroeconomic trends
and key relationships. Simulations of the staff econometric model
were used to estimate how variables would deviate from the baseline.

10. If an agreement was struck that put the budget on a path toward
balance early in the next decade, the equilibrium real funds rate
would ultimately fall about one percentage point.



(10) Under the baseline strategy, the Committee does not take

active steps to reduce inflation below its current trend of 3 percent.

As shown in the top panel of Chart 2, the nominal federal funds rate

is maintained at 5-1/2 percent; the associated real rate of 2-1/2 per-

cent puts the economy in the neighborhood of its potential. Under the

tighter scenario, the Committee actively promotes long-term price

stability by raising the federal funds rate by 100 basis points over

the course of 1996 and maintaining it at this level in 1997. This

initial restraint must be followed by reductions in the nominal funds

rate that outpace the drop in the inflation rate. The real funds rate

must be lowered to move policy to a neutral stance in order to avoid

overshooting price stability. While output returns to potential over

time, the sacrifice ratio in the model implies that reducing inflation

2 percentage points, as in this strategy, entails a cumulative output

loss of approximately 8 percent of potential GDP in the interim.

However, the model does not include forward-looking expectations that

might allow a possible role for central bank credibility in lowering

the cost of attaining price stability. Nor does the model incorporate

a significant long-term gain in potential output growth from reducing

inflation.

(11) Chart 3 indicates economic outcomes that could result if

the real equilibrium federal funds rate were shocked up or down by 50

basis points in 1996:Q1. Such a shock could arise from higher or

lower aggregate demand than projected, or lower or higher potential

output, which in turn might arise from a change in the natural rate

of unemployment.11 In the top panel, the Committee is assumed not

to adjust the nominal funds rate over the next three years in response

to this shock, but instead it keeps the funds rate along the baseline

path. The resulting imbalance between the actual and equilibrium real

rates sets off ever increasing or decreasing inflation, which in turn

serves to widen the real rate imbalance over time--exacerbating the

inflation instabilities.

(12) The divergences of inflation from the baseline become

perceptible only after the first year or so. The lower two panels

assume that, after a year, accumulating evidence that the equilibrium

real federal funds rate has changed prompts the Committee to respond.

These responses, shown in the middle panel, are calibrated to bring

inflation back to the 3 percent baseline path at the end of the simu-

lation period. In order to do so, the Committee must offset the

inadvertent stimulus or restraint, resulting from the lag in adjusting

policy, by subsequently holding the real rate above, or below, its

equilibrium value for a time. The deliberate overshooting of the

equilibrium funds rate is mirrored in an overshooting of the natural

rate of unemployment in the opposite direction. The symmetry of the

paths of inflation in these simulations stems from the specification

that the Committee had a fixed goal for inflation of 3 percent. If,

instead, the Committee were to follow an "opportunistic" strategy, it

would lean in the required direction against unexpected upward shocks

to the equilibrium rate of interest, but for downward shocks it would

not ease as much as in this simulation. This smaller amount of

11. In the staff model, the interest elasticities imply that an
increase, for example, in the real equilibrium funds rate of 1/2 per-
centage point could be brought about by raising aggregate demand or
lowering potential output by 1 percent. Potential output would de-
cline by 1 percent if the NAIRU rose by 1/2 percentage point--based on
estimates of Okun's Law.

easing, sufficient to return the economy to its potential but not

beyond, would lock in the decline in the inflation resulting from the

inadvertently restrictive policy during the period of the recognition

lag.

Long-Run Ranges for 1996

(13) As background for the Committee's discussion of its

money and debt ranges for 1996, the table below presents projections

for the growth of money and credit consistent with the staff Greenbook

forecast.

Growth of Money and Credit

Debt 5.3 4-1/2

M1 -1.8 -2-1/2
Adjusted for sweeps 1.4 4-3/4

Nominal GDP 4.2 4-1/2

(14) The staff projects M2 growth of 5-1/4 percent in 1996,

up from 4-1/4 percent last year. Such growth would be a bit faster

than that of nominal GDP, implying a slight drop in the velocity of M2

after little change last year (chart 4). The projected decline of

velocity reflects the effects of the recent flattening of the yield

curve, which will enhance the attractiveness of liquid monetary assets

relative to longer-term investments. 12 The standard staff econo-

metric model of M2 demand, which explains longer-run velocity move-

ments solely by short-term opportunity costs, forecasts essentially no

change in velocity for 1996, given the flat funds rate in the Green-

book forecast. The model underpredicted M2 growth by about 2 percent-

age points last year, and the staff believes that the decline in long-

term rates contributed to the forecast error; the staff M2 projection

12. Even though the staff forecast assumes a pickup in longer-term
rates, on average over 1996 the yield curve is flatter than in 1995.

for 1996 implicitly allows for a similar type of, albeit smaller,

model error this year.

(15) The staff forecast calls for M3 growth of 5-3/4 percent

over 1996, down from 6 percent last year, implying a somewhat smaller

decline in M3 velocity than last year. The slight slowing of M3 from

1995 reflects an anticipated 1-1/4 percentage point moderation in bank

credit growth (after adjustment for security revaluations), which is

only partly offset by a modest step-up in thrift asset expansion.

Bank funding needs are held down by weaker loan demand, as households

and businesses rely more on long-term borrowing in response to the

decline in bond and mortgage rates in recent months. The projection

makes some allowance for a shift to deposit funding as a consequence

of the recent elimination of deposit insurance premiums for well-

capitalized banks, but banks may become even more willing to issue,

and price attractively, wholesale deposits that are included in M3

than assumed in the staff's projection.

(16) The staff is projecting growth of domestic nonfinancial

debt this year at 4-1/2 percent. Both the federal and nonfederal

components are seen as growing at rates close to that of nominal GDP.

The moderation in nonfederal credit demands from last year in part

reflects some backing off of consumer installment borrowing, as both

borrowers and lenders become a bit more cautious in the face of rising

debt repayment burdens. By contrast, growth of home mortgage debt is

projected to maintain the pace of the last couple of years, accom-

panied by a little further pickup in refinancing activity. In the

business sector, increases in internal funds should help to damp

13. M2 demand might have become more sensitive to long-term interest
rates in recent years owing to the readier availability of bond and
stock mutual funds, which have reduced transactions costs of shifting
along the yield curve.



-13-

credit demands as equity retirements and spending on new capital

remain at the levels of 1995.

(17) The table below compares money and debt under the Green-

book baseline forecast with the economic forecasts embodying easier

and tighter monetary policies that are discussed in Part I of the

Greenbook. Whereas the federal funds rate is assumed to remain at

5-1/2 percent in 1996 under the Greenbook baseline, the funds rate in

the alternative strategies is gradually lowered or raised to reach a

level in the fourth quarter of this year that is 1 percentage point

below or above the baseline. The impact of these policy differences

on the growth of nominal GDP is only about 1/4 percentage point this

year, though that difference would widen in 1997. The differences in

nominal GDP show through to the monetary aggregates and debt. In

addition, M2 and, to a lesser extent, M3 would be affected in the same

direction by the alternative paths for interest rates and, hence,

opportunity costs.14

(18) The table also shows three alternative sets of ranges

for M2, M3, and debt for 1996 for Committee consideration.15 Alter-

native I represents the provisional ranges selected by the Committee

last July. Alternatives II and III raise the M2 and M3 ranges by 1

and 2 percentage points, respectively. The range for debt under all

three alternatives is held at its provisional level of 3 to 7 percent

because the staff projection under all three policies is in the middle

portion of this range.

14. For example, M2 in the easier strategy is boosted by faster
income and lower opportunity costs as interest rates decline.

15. Appendix B shows the Committee's announced annual ranges for
money and credit since 1979.

(19) On average over the last two years, the velocities of M2

and M3 have been behaving more in line with historical relationship,

than they did earlier in the 1990s. This might raise questions about

whether the aggregates are conveying information about the paths of

nominal GDP and spending and whether the Committee should increase the

attention paid to them. Major and persistent deviations from expecta-

tions in the expansion of money and debt may be symptomatic of unan-

ticipated developments in the intermediation and credit process that

should be examined for their potential implications for the economy.

However, the staff believes that considerable doubts remain as to the

relationships between the aggregates and nominal GDP, given the aber-

rant behavior in the early 1990s, which in retrospect is still partly

inexplicable, and the increased availability of other financial in-

struments, notably bond and stock mutual funds. Consequently, a

longer period of time during which the behavior of velocity can be

assessed under a variety of economic and financial circumstances is

probably required before much weight can be placed on those

aggregates.

(20) The staff baseline forecasts for M2 and M3 are, respec-

tively, above and near the upper bounds of the provisional ranges of

alternative I. If the Committee viewed the role of the ranges as one

I



-15-

of communicating to the public the rates of money growth that it ex-

pected would accompany its desired outcome for the economy and prices

in 1996, adoption of alternative I would seem most consistent with a

deliberate disinflation policy (tighter alternative). In recent semi-

annual monetary policy reports to the Congress, however, the Federal

Reserve has explained that these relatively low ranges were not cen-

tered on the Committee's expectations for money growth, but rather

were indicative of money expansion under conditions of price stability

if velocity were to behave in line with its historical pattern. The

Committee has noted in these reports that actual growth could even run

above the ranges in the transition to price stability. In this con-

text, frequent alteration of the annual ranges would risk confusing

observers about the Committee's ultimate policy intent. The remaining

uncertainty about the behavioral properties of the broad measures

going forward may reinforce Committee reluctance to "fine-tune" its

annual ranges, especially if the Committee were concerned that such

adjustments might be interpreted as implying that it was placing more

weight on these indicators than it intended.

(21) Alternative II nods in the direction of acknowledging

the upside probabilities embodied in the staff M2 and M3 projections

by raising their ranges by enough clearly to encompass--albeit in the

upper portions--the staff baseline money forecast. By encompassing

expected money growth this alternative still could be seen as consis-

tent with the baseline Greenbook forecast for the economy. Under the

"easier" strategy, M2 would be just as likely as not to overshoot its

upper bound, and there would also be risks in this regard if lower

interest rates were required to achieve the nominal income in the

staff forecast. This alternative might also be in accord with an



-16-

opportunistic disinflation strategy in that M2 is expected to lie in

the upper portion of its range, implying stronger reactions to upward

than to downward demand shocks to nominal income and inflation, as

discussed in the previous section. Should the inflation rate move

down further in later years, the ranges could be restored to their

current provisional settings.

(22) Alternative III better centers projected baseline growth

of both M2 and M3 within the ranges. Choice of this alternative would

seem to rest on the view that the ranges should be mainly oriented

toward providing Congress and the public with an estimated growth

interval for each aggregate over the relevant year that essentially

balances the risks of an over- or undershoot if the economy performs

as the Committee expects. Under such an approach, the Committee would

attempt to incorporate fully in advance intermediate-run effects, such

as responsiveness to interest-rate movements or other factors, into

the specified ranges. More willingness to adjust the current year's

ranges at mid-year also could be part of this approach. This approach

would not necessarily imply that the Committee would place more weight

on the aggregates in the conduct of policy. Indeed, the Committee

could continue to deemphasize the use of the ranges as intermediate

policy targets. Alternative III would seem especially appealing in

the context of conveying information about expected money growth if

the Committee had a fairly strong presumption that further easing

actions could well prove warranted this year to forestall an unaccep-

tably weak economic performance or to adjust to lessening inflation

pressures. Or, if the Committee accepts the relationships embedded in

the staff forecast, this alternative could seem attractive if the



-17-

Committee did not contemplate downward pressure on inflation this year

through either a deliberate or opportunistic strategy.



-18-

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(23) The unchanged funds rate of alternative B is consistent

with the staff Greenbook forecast. In that forecast, with a steady

nominal funds rate, the unemployment rate remains a touch below the

staff's estimate of the natural rate and core inflation edges higher,

but only to about 3 percent in 1997. Not only might alternative B be

seen as attractive if the Committee concurred with this outlook and

found the results acceptable, but it also might have appeal as a "wait

and see" strategy because delays in data have curtailed the new infor-

mation available to the Committee since it eased policy in December.

A similar point could be made about the fiscal situation, which might

be clarified to some extent in the next few weeks given negotiations

now underway between the President and Congressional leaders.

(24) The staff outlook appears to be more buoyant than that

of market participants, who evidently view the odds of a modest policy

easing at the upcoming meeting to be about even and expect appreciable

declines in the funds rate over coming months. Thus, rates could edge

higher under alternative B.16 However, the extent of any rise in

such rates likely would be tempered in the near term by the perception

that the Committee had merely postponed easing pending the availabi-

lity of more information. Over time, an economy and monetary policy

more consistent with the staff outlook than that of the market would

put additional upward pressure on rates. The dollar would be expected

to trade around recent higher levels on foreign exchange markets.

Markets are likely to continue to pay close attention to shifting

16. Reserve management may continue to be complicated to a degree
for the next few weeks by the very low level of required reserve
balances resulting from the ongoing introduction of deposit sweep
arrangements interacting with seasonal lows in reserve balances.
These developments may in turn be associated with greater volatility
in the federal funds market.



-19-

fiscal prospects, and if potential default on Treasury debt still

looms in late February, markets could become skittish, given that the

Treasury has indicated that its scope to maneuver to avoid default

will be exhausted by the beginning of March.

(25) Justification for a quarter-point reduction in the

federal funds rate under alternative A would seem to rest on a belief

that the economy is weaker than in the staff outlook, as might be

inferred from the tone of some anecdotal reports and recent data, or

that the prospects for disinflation are brighter. In this regard, the

effects of the recently firmer dollar on spending and prices might be

seen as giving scope for some modest lowering of interest rates. An

easing in the next few months, although not necessarily at this meet-

ing, is consistent with expectations both of market participants, as

embodied in the yield curve, and, as suggested by the Blue Chip sur-

vey, of many outside forecasters whose inflation outlook on average

nonetheless does not differ significantly from the staff's.

(26) Money market interest rates would fall by less than a

quarter point under alternative A, given current expectations. Such a

decline in the federal funds rate could be achieved by adding nonbor-

rowed reserves through open market operations, reducing the borrowing

allowance by a small amount, or through a 25 basis point reduction in

the discount rate to 5 percent.17 Intermediate- and long-term

interest rates could drop significantly should market participants

view actions at two successive meetings as suggesting that the Federal

Reserve had reason to believe that economy is weak and inflation risks

17. Judging from experience from September 1992 through January
1994, putting the funds rate equal to the discount rate would present
no special operational problems.



-20-

are minimal. Against this background, incoming economic data suggest-

ing a more buoyant economy could cause a sharp reversal of the inter-

est rate declines.

(27) If the Committee agreed with the staff outlook for

spending and inflation and wanted to make deliberate progress toward

price stability, the choice of a quarter-point increase in the federal

funds rate under alternative C might be favored. Such a policy tight-

ening would come as a complete surprise to market participants, and

short-term interest rates would rise substantially. Intermediate- and

long-term rates would also move appreciably higher, especially in real

terms, as market participants re-evaluated the expected path for mone-

tary policy. With the direction of interest rates here and abroad

beginning to diverge, the dollar could well strengthen further on

foreign exchange markets.

(28) The table below shows money and credit growth under

alternative B for the January-to-June period. Relative to the ex-

perience of recent months, we would expect some pickup in credit

growth to accompany the staff GDP projection, partly as the federal

government returns to more normal patterns of funding and cash

balances given the assumed lifting of the debt ceiling. Growth of

total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to expand at a

6 percent rate from January to June, leaving this aggregate around the

center of its tentative range for 1996. The expansion in M2 is ex-

pected to continue to be supported by last year's declines in oppor-

tunity costs and the relatively flat yield curve. The spread of



-21-

sweeps will lead to further reductions in M1 and the reserve aggre-

gates. By midyear M2 would be at or slightly above its 1-to-5 percent

tentative 1996 range under all three alternatives. M3 at midyear

would be just within its 2-to-6 percent range.

Directive Language

(29) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft

wording relating to the Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 1996

and the operating paragraph for the intermeeting period.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee at [DEL: its] THIS meeting [DEL:in July

reaffirmed the range it had] established RANGES [DEL: on January

31 -- February 1] for growth of M2 AND M3 OF ___ TO __ AND __ TO

___ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY [DEL: of 1 to 5 percent], measured from

the fourth quarter of [DEL: 1994] 1995 to the fourth quarter of

[DEL: 1995] 1996. The [DEL: Committee also retained the] monitoring

range [DEL: of 3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set] for

growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt WAS SET AT ___ TO

___ PERCENT FOR THE YEAR. The [DEL: Committee raised the 1995

range for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to

take account of changing intermediation patterns. For

1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis the

samme ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary

aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of

1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.] The behavior of the

monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the

light of progress toward price level stability, movements

in their velocities, and developments in the economy and

financial markets.



-24-

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly (SOME-

WHAT)/MAINTAIN/INCREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT) the existing

degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of

the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and

sustainable economic growth, and giving careful considera-

tion to economic, financial, and monetary developments,

slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT)

or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would

(MIGHT) be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consis-

tent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate

the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review, as

well as a minor redefinition of M2. The attached tables compare

growth rates of the old and revised series. These data should be

regarded as strictly confidential until their release to the public in

mid-February.

The revisions had no net effect on the annual growth rate of

M2 over 1995, but they raised the annual growth rates of M1 and M3 by

0.1 percentage point over the past year. For earlier years, revisions

to the annual growth rates of M2 ranged between -0.5 and +0.4 percent-

age point, while the annual growth rates of M1 and M3 were revised

by smaller amounts.

Redefinition

There has been a minor redefinition of M2, involving a shift

of the volatile overnight wholesale RPs and Eurodollars from M2 into

non-M2 M3. The redefinition, which did not affect M1 or M3, lowered

M2 in all years since 1969, by amounts that cumulated to $118 billion

in 1995.

Benchmark Revisions

The benchmark incorporates minor revisions to data reported

on the detailed weekly and quarterly deposit reports, and it takes

account of deposit data from call reports for banks and thrifts that

do not report on any of the detailed deposit reports. The benchmark

also incorporates historical data for a number of money market mutual

funds that began reporting for the first time during 1995, raising the

levels of M2 and M3 over the year by amounts that cumulate to $1

billion and $9 billion, respectively.



-2-

Seasonal Review Revisions

In a process similar to that used in previous years, seasonal

factors for the monetary aggregates have been revised using the X-11

ARIMA procedure applied to the benchmarked data through December 1995.

However, this year, seasonal factors were constructed for total RPs

and total Eurodollar deposits, both of which are now entirely in non-

M2 M3. Furthermore, seasonally adjusted non-M1 M2 and non-M2 M3 have

each been redefined to be the sum of their seasonally adjusted

components; previously, both non-M1 M2 and non-M2 M3 were seasonally

adjusted as a whole.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0
percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect
on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively,
and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth
and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the
target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the fourth
quarter of 1982.
