MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
All debt markets tightened sharply in the period since the
last meeting of the Committee, with interest rates in the U.S. Govern-
ment, municipal, and corporate bond markets rising 15-40 basis points,
and short-term rates on Treasury bills, bankers' acceptances, and
commercial and finance company paper 30-40 basis points. The rise in
long-term rates was especially sharp, as compared with normal move-
ments in such yields; these rates had in recent months lagged more
than usually behind the rise in short rates. In the short-term market,
the 3-month bill reached a peak of 5.92 per cent (and the 6-month bill
6.08 per cent), while bankers' acceptances and finance company paper
was yielding rates of 6 -- 6-1/4 per cent in the 3- and 6-month areas.
Most recently, short-term market rates have eased somewhat, with the
3-month bill rate dropping to 5.75 per cent.
The rise of interest rates to new peaks in good part reflected
market disappointment at the further delay in Congressional consideration
of the fiscal package, and dimming of hopes for the eventual passage of
the legislation; similarly, new flickers of hope for fiscal action
have led to some rate declines in the last few days. The net increase
in interest rates since the last meeting of the Committee also reflected
the tightening of conditions in money markets that resulted from the
mid-April discount rate increase and the subsequent restraint in pro-
vision of reserves through open market operations. Both the expecta-
tional shift and the cumulative impact of monetary restraint came

together to affect markets at a time when intermediate- and long-term
markets particularly were in a weak technical position--with a sizable
volume of corporate issues in syndicate or foreseeable, with dealer
holdings of State and local government securities building up, and
with the Treasury coupon market in process of absorbing the mid-May
combined cash and exchange offering (which raised $2 billion of new
Thus far in May (and also in the last three business days
in April) Federal funds have traded most frequently in a 6-1/8 --
6-1/2 per cent range, well above the April range of 5-1/2 -- 5-3/4
per cent. And new loan rates to dealers posted by major money market
banks moved generally into a 6-5/8 -- 6-7/8 per cent range from a
6 -- 6-1/4 per cent range the month before. In the last few days both
Federal funds and dealer loan rates have run a little below their
earlier peaks, partly because large Euro-dollar borrowings by major
money market banks eased the reserve position of such banks.
This substantial a tightening of the market for one-day
money occurred with relatively little further deepening in banks' net
borrowed reserve positions. Member bank borrowing during the four
statement weeks ending May 22 have averaged $720 million and net
borrowed reserves $380 million, only slightly larger than the averages
of $690 million and $340 million, respectively, in the previous four
The rise in the discount rate to 5-1/2 per cent in mid-April,
and subsequent expectations of further tightening of monetary policy, were
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
factors pressing Federal funds and dealer loan rates further upwards,
as banks sought to hold down current borrowing at the discount window.
But in addition, the continued sharply reduced net inflows of time
and savings deposits, particularly at large banks, increasingly
placed a premium on banks' borrowing from other sources, principally
the Federal funds and Euro-dollar markets, and contributed to the rise
in yields in such markets. And dealer financing demands related to
the mid-May refunding were another factor exerting pressure on the
money market. With higher money market rates prevailing, the System
charged a rate of 5-3/4 per cent (1/4 per cent above the discount
rate) on its repurchase agreements, and made substantial use of this
instrument in meeting reserve needs during the period. The tightness
of the central money market contributed to the sharp rise in Treasury
bill rates that developed once bill trading positions of dealers
increased and expectations of the likelihood of a tax increase became
more pessimistic.
The increased level of market interest rates has continued
to hold back net inflows of time and savings deposits to banks, and
such deposits in May are estimated to rise at only about a 1/2 per
cent annual rate. The growth rate in time and savings deposits is
lower than anticipated at the previous Committee meeting largely
because banks, as it turned out, did not add to outstanding CD's over
the month. Part of the explanation for this is that most banks were
not particularly aggressive bidders for what funds were available when
there was leeway under the new Regulation Q ceiling rates after they
were first announced. Later, short-term interest ratesrose so rapidly
-3- May 24, 1968.

that banks suddenly found their ability to compete on a rate basis
virtually gone.
With U.S. Government demand deposits continuing to decline
in May, the money supply appears to be rising at about a 9 per cent
annual rate. The decline in U.S. Government deposits did not turn
out to be as large as earlier projected, however, because the Treasury
raised about $1.3 billion more cash at mid-May than assumed (after
allowing for the $300 million that was spent by Treasury investment
accounts to help reduce the overhang of new issues in dealer positions
following the further delay in tax action).
The bank credit proxy in May is estimated to rise at about
a 1/2 per cent annual rate. This growth rate, after allowance is made
for the larger-than-assumed Treasury financing, is at the bottom end
of the range projected at the time of the previous meeting. The
additional financing added about 2-1/2 percentage points to the growth
rate of the proxy, which had been projected -2 to +2 per cent range
absent the additional financing. After including also the sharp rise
in Euro-dollar borrowings by banks during the month--over $1 billion
in the last three statement weeks--the adjusted credit proxy would
show a 3 per cent annual rate of growth.
On balance, during the past two months (April and May),
there has been no bank credit growth, as measured by the proxy on a
daily average basis, even after allowing for funds from non-deposit
sources. The sharp rise in market interest rates during this period
has reduced the growth rate in time and savings deposits to fractional
proportions. The growth in money supply over the past two months has

comparison with earlier periods, is shown in the table below (all

data for April, when the Wednesday series shows a substantial increase.
(Data are insufficient to make a reasonable estimate for May). Divergent
seasonal factors are most of the explanation for April. In addition, of
course, the last Wednesday series is often subject to sharp changes result-
ing from special circumstances that affect single day figures. It is
the staff's view that the "proxy plus Euro-dollar" measure is probably
the best indicator of recent bank credit movements because its seasonals
appear more accurately to take account of the recent tax speed-ups
and also because it is less subject to the vagaries of day-to-day bank
reserve position management and adjustments.

Prospective developments
Two financial threats on the horizon are (a) that banks
will experience a sharply larger than seasonal attrition of outstanding
CD's in June, and (b) that other savings institutions as well as banks
will experience large withdrawals of funds from time and savings
accounts in the late June-early July reinvestment period. Whether and
to what degree these threats materialize will depend importantly on
the progress of fiscal legislation. In the absence of a tax increase
and if the worst market expectations are realized with respect to
disintermediation, there would likely be a further substantial
tightening in bank lending terms to business customers, sharp
further cut-backs in mortgage lending, and perhaps liquidity crises
affecting selected institutions.
Of the two threats, that of a CD run-off threat is more likely
to arise between now and the next meeting of the Committee on June 18.
Bill rates are higher relative to ceiling rates now than they were in
early April. That is, rate relationships alone--with a bill rate
structure currently anchored around a 5.75 per cent 3-month rate-
provide banks with practically no leeway to attract funds, not e%
with the minimum leeway in the very short-term area such as exist
in the earlier period. It is, of course, likely that long-term
customer relationships will enable banks to roll-over some CD's. At
the moment, the staff's best guess is that attrition could run any-
where from around 20 to 40 per cent of maturing CD's, depending
chiefly on the course of market interest rates.
May 24, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
We do not have the end of May CD maturity survey, which
would provide definite figures on the amount of CD's maturing in June,
but the survey taken at the end of April indicated $4.3 billion of
maturities in June (with $1.1 billion maturing on the dividend and
tax dates). Assuming only a few sales into June in the ensuing
month, total June maturities would be about $1 billion less than
banks were faced with in April, when nearly $1.1 billion of CD's ran
off before the Regulation Q revision on April 19. On the basis of
present information, the staff would estimate a further decline of
outstanding CD's in June of somewhat over $1 billion if the 3-month
bill rate were more toward the lower end of a 5.65 -- 6.00 per cent
Where within this range the bill rate is most likely to be
will depend in large part on market expectations as to the course of
monetary policy and of debt management. Prospects for fiscal restraint
are, of course, critical to the market's evaluation of the direction of
monetary policy and of market interest rates. If fiscal restraint
begins to appear more likely the bill rate could readily move toward,
or possibly below, the lower end of the range in the next few weeks.
The following constellation of money market conditions may
be consistent with a continuing taut situation in credit markets, but
one perhaps somewhat less tense than developed at the peak of market
pressures in the recent period of adverse expectations. Such money market
conditions would encompass a Federal funds rate in a 6 -- 6-1/4 per cent
range, net borrowed reserves in a $300 - $450 million range, and member
May 24, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
bank borrowings averaging around $650 - $700 million. The more
conditions are toward the lower end of these ranges, the more likely
is it that the bill rate will be in the lower half of the range. As
was the case at times during the past few weeks, however, markets are
likely to be so sensitive in the period ahead to various international
and domestic developments that the various money market indicators,
taken together or individually, may be subject to abrupt and
unprojected movements.
The odds would tilt somewhat further toward moderation of
upward bill rate pressures between now and the next meeting of the
Committee if the Treasury holds off from raising cash in June in
anticipation of its large July-August need (estimated at as much as
$9 billion without a tax increase, and $7.5 billion with an increase).
However, if sizable additional Treasury bill offerings were to be
announced in the next few weeks, it is not at all clear that even the
lower end of the ranges for money market variables specified above
would keep bill and other short-term rates from rising significantly
further absent signs of positive action on a tax increase. And any
further rise in short-term rates is likely to encourage additional long-
term interest rate increases, as banks come under more and more pressure
to continue tightening loan policies and to withdraw from the municipal
market and also to accelerate their net liquidation of U.S. Government

because of tax payments, will tend to force banks out of securities

markets in any event. And if these demands develop in very large size,
many money market banks would become less willing lenders to dealers
in an effort to preserve their loanable funds for good corporate
customers. Thus, strong loan demands could lead to a wider than
usual spread of dealer loan rates over the Federal funds rate and to
strong upward pressure on bill rates.
Given all the conflicting possibilities inherent in the near-
term outlook, the staff's maximum likelihood projection for the credit
proxy in June is for a decline in a 1 to 4 per cent annual rate range.
The mid-point of this range assumes a CD run-off of somewhat over
$1 billion during the month, or a decline of about $600 million more
than seasonal. It appears unlikely that enough additional Euro-
dollars can be obtained by banks, at interest rates they may be
willing to countenance, to raise the proxy by more than two or three
percentage points. The very large Treasury cash financing needs in
July and August will impose a heavy underwriting burden on the banking
system. But given maintenance of current interest rate relationships,
any bank credit expansion is likely to be quite modest since banks may
sell off of the next issues quite quickly.
With the CD assumption, noted above time and savings deposits
of banks in June are expected to show virtually no growth, or to decline
slightly. There is no reason to expect consumer-type time and savings
deposits to show any more strength than in the preceding two months,
and they could be even weaker, given the higher level of market
interest rates that has developed recently.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -10- May 24, 1968.
The money supply in June is expected to continue rising in
a 7 - 9 per cent annual rate range, about the same as in the last
two months as the Treasury balance continues to decline sharply
(assuming no large cash financing in June). Strong loan demands over
the tax period may also be a factor tending to keep money growth up.
Businesses may be unwilling to draw down existing cash balances, or
other liquidity instruments to any very great extent, in view of the
uncertain future state of credit conditions. Investors may also tend
to keep funds idle in cash for short periods as they assess the
credit outlook.

the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions of projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, bank's investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
bank's desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loan demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
