The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

CLASS I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Immediately after the July FOMC meeting, the borrowing

objective was set at $600 million, reflecting a slight easing of policy

and also an upward technical adjustment to take account of unusually

strong seasonal borrowing. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged

$581 million in the two maintenance periods completed in July, and, in

line with the policy move, the federal funds rate edged down to around

9-1/4 percent after the FOMC meeting. The funds rate remained in that

neighborhood until late in the month, when policy was eased further with a

reduction in the borrowing objective to $550 million, in the context of

incoming data which continued to portray a softer economy and some less-

ening in inflationary pressures. Since then, federal funds have traded

around 9 percent, but actual borrowing in the most recent complete main-

tenance period averaged $621 million, boosted by a shortfall in reserves

owing to an unexpectedly large Treasury balance on the last day of the

period. Over the first eight days of the current period, borrowing has

run at $521 million on average. Seasonal credit continues strong, but is

down a bit from its late-July levels of more than $500 million, perhaps in

response to the lower funds rate.

(2) During the past six weeks, market interest rates swung over

a wide range in response to shifting perceptions about the state of the

economy and the outlook for monetary policy, but most rates ended the

period with only modest net changes. The easing of policy that occurred

in July had been expected at the time of the last meeting. Nonetheless,



-2-

rates continued to decline through July as weaker-than-anticipated eco-

nomic data were seen as portending additional policy steps. The 1/2 per-

centage point drop in the funds rate was accompanied by a somewhat larger

decline in most private money market rates, and major banks cut their

prime rate one-half percentage point to 10-1/2 percent. Long-term rates

also fell. In early August, however, market sentiment changed on release

of the July employment report. With various other economic indicators

also showing some strengthening, the market's expectations of further

near-term easing by the Federal Reserve were scaled back. The consequent

backup in rates left long-term yields about where they were at the time of

the last FOMC meeting and Treasury bill rates up about 1/4 percentage

point on balance. Short-term private rates, however, remained down on

balance, by roughly 30 basis points from their early-July levels. In

equity markets, most major price indexes reached record highs during the

intermeeting period, before dropping back some. Nevertheless, they

retained increases of as much as 9 percent over the period.

(3) Unusually large changes in some interest rate spreads have

occurred recently, related in part to supply effects stemming from the

process of resolving troubled thrifts. In money markets, spreads between

private and Treasury rates narrowed substantially. Bill supplies had been

expected to rise markedly in the third quarter, after a huge paydown of

bills in the second quarter, as the Treasury's needs for funding picked

up. Passage of the thrift legislation, which called for the Treasury to

funnel $18.8 billion to the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) before the

end of September, added to borrowing requirements in the bill market. In



-3-

long-term markets, however, the thrift situation has contributed to a

widening of spreads between some obligations and Treasury issues. For

example, the prospect of thrifts liquidating their $14 billion in holdings

of junk bonds to comply with the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,

and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), along with a steady stream of new

issuance and concerns about rising defaults, helped raise spreads in that

market to their highest levels this decade. In secondary mortgage mar-

kets, there were some sizable sales of mortgage-backed securities by sav-

ings and loans, and the outlook for further sales by the industry was a

factor keeping spreads about 50 basis points wider than earlier this year.

This increase in spreads has fed through to an extent to the primary mar-

ket for fixed-rate mortgages, where rates have fallen less than yields on

comparable maturity Treasury issues this year. Over the same period,

initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have not declined on balance,

even as other short-term rates moved lower, as deep discounting of ARMs

has become less popular.

(4) As with interest rates, exchange rates moved over a fairly

wide range during the intermeeting period in response to release of eco-

nomic data and associated actual or expected Federal Reserve monetary

policy actions. On balance, the dollar's exchange value rose by 2-3/4

percent on a weighted-average basis in terms of other G-10 currencies.

The recent strengthening of the dollar perhaps reflected a firming of real

returns on dollar assets relative to previous expectations, based on

better inflation news and a stronger economy, as well as improvement in

the trade balance. The Desk sold a total of $950 million against yen and



marks;

(5) Growth in the broader monetary aggregates accelerated in

July and appears to have continued at a fairly strong pace into August.

The rapid rebuilding of balances drawn down to meet April tax liabilities

and the substantial narrowing of opportunity costs since the spring con-

tributed to the pickup in money. M2 grew at a 12 percent annual rate last

month, lifting it to the lower end of its target range. Growth in July

was considerably above the 7 percent rate specified at the last FOMC meet-

ing for the three months ending September. M3 growth was boosted by a

pickup in bank credit and, at 9-1/4 percent, also exceeded the 7 percent

rate the Committee expected for the June-to-September interval.

(6) Strength was especially evident in the liquid components of

the aggregates, which earlier in the year had borne the brunt of the out-

sized tax payments. Moreover, opportunity costs on these accounts dropped

sharply through late July relative both to market instruments and to less

liquid types of deposits. Transactions deposits rebounded in July, lift-

ing M1 to a 10-1/2 percent rate of growth. Demand deposits grew at a

17 percent annual rate, boosted both by lower opportunity costs and by

higher compensating balance requirements, while OCDs registered their

first monthly increase this year. Similarly, within nontransactions M2,

the liquid components were responsible for the acceleration last month;

1. With currency growth remaining subdued, the monetary base expanded
at just a 4 percent annual rate, close to its average for the year to
date, even as total reserves growth jumped to a 7-1/4 percent rate.



-5-

growth in small time deposits slowed substantially. The strength in over-

all M2 deposits last month held down depository institutions' needs for

managed liabilities. Large time deposit issuance by banks increased only

moderately, despite the more rapid rise in bank credit. At thrifts, siz-

able declines were posted in large time deposits and term RPs in M3, as

well as in FHLB advances, likely signalling a further contraction in their

assets last month.

(7) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have

grown in July at about the reduced 7 percent rate of June. Business bor-

rowing strengthened as C&I loans at banks increased at better than a

15 percent rate. The turnaround in loans more than offset lower borrowing

in other markets: net issuance of commercial paper by nonfinancial firms

came to a halt last month, and corporate bond issuance slowed from its

rapid May-June pace as the decline in long-term rates stalled. Available

information on household debt suggests no sharp deviations from the recent

growth paths of either mortgage or consumer credit. Real estate loan

growth at banks increased a bit in July from its first-half pace, but the

June mortgage commitment data from thrifts showed a downturn. Municipal

and federal borrowing in July appears to have been quite subdued. The

federal government continued to benefit from the large size of the April

tax payments and financed its deficit last month by drawing on its cash

balance. Over the remainder of the third quarter, however, the Treasury's

funding needs are set to grow rapidly, boosted by the $18.8 billion called

for by FIRREA. Already, a $15 billion 247-day cash management bill has

been issued, in part to finance RTC's initial operations. Through July,



-6-

overall domestic nonfinancial debt grew at about a 7-3/4 percent annual

rate from its fourth-quarter base, leaving it in the lower portion of its

6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee con-

sideration. Alternative B involves federal funds continuing to trade

mostly in a 9 to 9-1/8 percent range and adjustment plus seasonal borrow-

ing at the discount window remaining at $550 million. Under alternative

A, a funds rate of 8-1/2 to 8-5/8 percent would be expected to be asso-

ciated with borrowing of $450 million, while under alternative C, a funds

rate of 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 percent would accompany borrowing of $650 million.

As is apparent, the alternatives incorporate a rule of thumb of 50 basis

points on the funds rate for each $100 million change in adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing, implying discount borrowing behavior that is only half

as responsive as that embodied in the traditional rule of thumb. This

reduced sensitivity stems in part from the very low and largely frictional

levels of adjustment borrowing that would be consistent with any of these

funds rates. Consequently, the bulk of borrowing is likely to remain

seasonal credit. Under alternative A, seasonal credit would have to drop

significantly from current levels. Such credit is sensitive to the spread

between the funds rate and the discount rate, though less so than adjust-

ment credit has been historically. Abstracting from interest-spread

effects, seasonal borrowing, which reached record levels in late July, is

likely to begin to move lower later in the intermeeting period. But with

seasonal credit showing surprising strength and adjustment credit inex-

plicably weak, the outlook for borrowing remains uncertain, suggesting

continued flexibility by the Desk in its approach to the borrowing objec-

tive.



-9-

(9) Markets still seem to expect a slight easing of policy over

the months ahead. The stability of the funds rate around the current

level under alternative B, especially if combined with incoming economic

data in line with the greenbook forecast of sustained economic growth,

would raise further doubts in securities markets about the likelihood of

such an easing. The alteration of market perceptions about future policy

moves may induce a small rise in private money market rates. Treasury

bill rates already have adjusted upward relative to private short-term

rates in reflection of actual and near-term heavy supply. Thus, they

could edge up by less than private rates--to the 8 percent level--as the

recent surge in bill issuance recedes after the initial RTC funding is

completed. Intermediate- and long-term yields could move up over coming

months, though by limited amounts should inflation remain moderate in line

with the staff forecast. Supported by slightly higher market rates,

strength in the dollar on foreign exchange markets could persist, at least

for a time.

(10) Alternative A's policy easing likely would engender general

declines in market yields. A 50 basis point reduction in the trading

range for federal funds would come more promptly, and be larger, than the

easing currently built into the structure of interest rates. Money market

interest rates could drop 1/4 percentage point or so--and somewhat more if

the action itself fostered the notion that the Federal Reserve would be

inclined to undertake additional steps to loosen reserve pressure in the

months ahead. A rally in bond markets also would seem probable, espe-

cially because inflation concerns do not now seem to be weighing on market



-10-

psychology; however, should spending prove reasonably strong, there is

some risk that such concerns would be reignited against the background of

the further easing of policy in alternative A. Some downward adjustment

to the exchange value of the dollar also could occur since foreign author-

ities would be unlikely to follow up with comparable easing actions in

light of inflationary pressures abroad.

(11) Under alternative C, market interest rates would back up

abruptly, given that the Federal Reserve policy tightening would come as a

surprise. Increases in short rates by more than the 1/2 percentage point

rise in the funds rate could well occur, as market participants reassessed

not only current but also future money market conditions in light of a

more restrictive policy stance than they anticipated. The advance in bond

yields probably would be more restrained in view of the implications of

higher short-term rates for future economic activity and inflation. Such

monetary policy tightening would result in some additional upward pressure

on the dollar.

(12) Growth of the monetary aggregates from June to September

expected to be associated with the three policy alternatives is given in

the table below. (More detailed data are shown on the table and charts on

subsequent pages.) With only six weeks left in the quarter, most of the

effects of the various money market conditions associated with the alter-

natives would be felt in the fourth quarter; money growth over the June-

to-September period differs relatively little across the three alter-

natives, with M2 rising well into the lower half of its annual range by

September, while M3 edges up a little further in the lower half of its



-11-

range. Growth of the aggregates will be supported by continued expansion

in nominal income around its recent pace and by the declines in oppor-

tunity costs of monetary assets since March. Nevertheless, M2 and M3 are

projected to slow over the remainder of the third quarter as the restock-

ing of balances depleted earlier by tax payments is completed and as the

resolution of the thrift crisis depresses retail deposits and managed

liabilities at S&Ls. In the staff greenbook forecast, the resolution is

not expected to have a material impact on mortgage activity, residential

construction, and GNP expansion more generally, but the particular

approach taken by the RTC will affect the money growth rates associated

with a given path for the economy. However, the impact of the resolution

on the aggregates seems rather difficult to predict with any precision, in

part because it depends on policies yet to be fully specified.

(13) Although passage of thrift legislation should bolster depos-

ties, along with discouragement of asset expansion at thrifts, are

-13-

expected on balance to damp growth of the broader aggregates.2 The

restraining effect might be particularly evident in the period just ahead

owing to the inducement for the RTC to spend $20 billion by the end of

September. Most of those funds are likely to replace current S&L liabili-

ties, with particular focus on high-yielding liabilities. With respect to

M2, premia on offering rates on small time deposits at insolvent thrifts

should decline, with a more general softening of deposit rates possible at

both banks and thrifts as competitive pressures become less intense.3  In

response to the higher opportunity costs on deposits, some portion of the

funds withdrawn is likely to be transferred by the public into investments

outside M2. This would be particularly true of brokered deposits, which

often are of high denomination ($80,000 to $100,000) and may be held by

especially rate-sensitive investors. Partly as a consequence, M2 growth

under alternative B is projected to slow from around 8 percent in August

to 6 percent in September, with the resolution impact accounting for per-

haps as much as 1 percentage point of the moderation. Moreover, the

rebound in market rates since their lows in late July has widened oppor-

tunity costs, which will also tend to damp M2 growth.

(14) The influence of the legislation on M3 will be considerably

larger. Those government funds not substituting for M2 liabilities will

2. In addition to outright deposit payouts, RTC will use its resources
to make advances or deposits at operating insolvent institutions; the
staff presumes that even in the case of deposits these liabilities will
not be counted in the monetary aggregates.
3. Depositories purchasing the deposits of liquidated thrifts
apparently will have the right to lower rates on the acquired deposits
to the passbook savings rate. Thrifts under conservatorship, but not
yet liquidated, will be discouraged from offering above-market rates;
this is likely to have its most important effect on brokered deposits,
which usually are included in the small-time category.



-14-

be available to substitute for managed liabilities, including those in M3.

Moreover, assets held by insolvent thrifts will decline as these institu-

tions are liquidated or pared in size by RTC conservators; some assets

will be sold into markets and others may be acquired by the RTC, which

would fund them from non-M3 sources. Tighter capital requirements and

more restrictive asset standards also should hold down asset expansion at

other thrifts, whose sales of mortgage-backed securities may begin to be

supplemented by sales of junk bonds. While thrift RPs and large time

deposits should continue to decline, some of the reduction in managed

liabilities at thrifts will take the form of repayments of FHLB advances

and other non-M3 borrowing, muting the decline in M3.5 Moreover,

responding to the higher spreads on mortgages, banks are likely to absorb

a portion of thrift assets, boosting their needs for funds. On balance,

the thrift situation is projected to damp M3 growth by about 2 percentage

points in September to 5 percent under alternative B.

(15) In the fourth quarter, if short-term interest rates remain

around current levels, as in the staff economic forecast, M2 growth is

seen at a 6-1/2 percent rate, a little above the projected pace of nominal

GNP. For the quarter, the impact on velocity of the lower offering rates

associated with the thrift resolution process is assumed about to offset

the effects of earlier declines in market rates. Growth of M2 for the

year would come to about 4-1/4 percent, damped only slightly by the

4. On balance, the staff expects a decline in total thrift assets over
the rest of the year.
5. Certain provisions of FIRREA, removing the supervisory role of FHLBs
and tightening collateral requirements and the purpose of advances, may
prompt these institutions to become more restrictive in lending. Should
this occur, M3 would be damped less than assumed by the staff.



-15-

accelerated thrift resolution. However, the effect on annual growth of M3

may be as large as 1/2 percentage point. Growth in this aggregate in the

fourth quarter is projected to remain close to its 5 percent September

pace, bringing its advance for the year to 4-1/2 percent.

(16) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is pro-

jected to strengthen to a 9 percent pace over August and September, before

moderating to 8 percent over the fourth quarter. For August and Septem-

ber, the federal component will be boosted by the initial financing of

thrift resolution spending; after September this spending will be financed

off-budget by REFCORP, which is not included in the debt measure. Outside

the federal sector, debt growth is expected to slow somewhat in September

after being augmented in July and August by corporate restructuring

activity. Over the fourth quarter debt of nonfederal borrowers is pro-

jected to increase at around the 8 percent pace of the first half of the

year. Growth for the year of the total debt measure is projected at 8-1/4

percent, with about 1/4 percentage point of this total accounted for by

the additional federal borrowing associated with the on-budget thrift

financing.

(17) Alternative C, by widening opportunity costs on liquid

balances, would tend to retard M2 growth to a 4-1/2 percent rate in Sep-

tember. If rates remained at the higher level associated with this

alternative, little pickup in M2 growth would be anticipated in the fourth

quarter, despite the waning impact of the effects of the thrift resolu-

tion. For the year, M2 likely would grow at a 3-3/4 percent rate. The

lower interest rates of alternative A could boost M2 growth to a 7-1/2



-16-

percent rate in September, and, with comparable growth in the fourth

quarter, to 4-3/4 percent for the year. By contrast, with both M3 and

debt much less responsive to variations in short-term rates, their annual

growth rates are unlikely to differ appreciably from those consistent with

the flat interest rates in the staff forecast.

Directive Language:

(18) Shown below is a draft of the operational paragraph with the

standard options, including the existing ordering and wording of the fac-

tors that could prompt an intermeeting adjustment in reserve pressures.

(19) As the members will recall, the Committee was polled shortly

after the July meeting regarding preferences for the ordering and wording

of the factors bearing on intermeeting adjustments. A majority indicated

at that time that they wanted to continue to give first priority to price

developments, but a significant minority proposed moving the reference to

business conditions up to the top of the list. Several commented on the

placement of the monetary aggregates in the listing; three indicated that

they would move the aggregates up to first or second place, but four

expressed strong reservations about giving them greater prominence, in-

cluding two who wanted to move them to the bottom of the list. With

regard to particular wording, a number suggested substituting a reference

to "progress toward price stability" for the current "indications of in-

flationary pressures"

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly (SOMEWHAT)/

MAINTAIN/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. Taking account of indications of infla-

tionary pressures, the strength of the business expansion,

the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in



-18-

foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint (WOULD)(MIGHT) or some-

what (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth

of M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at

annual rates of about [DEL: 7] ____ AND ____ percent RESPECTIVELY. The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to

the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions

during the period before the next meeting are likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a

range of [DEL: 7 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent.
