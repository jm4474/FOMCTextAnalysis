The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Class I - FOMC August 13, 1993

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Throughout the intermeeting period, the federal funds

rate has averaged close to the Committee's expectation of 3 percent.

Many other interest rates moved up some when the Chairman's Humphrey-

Hawkins testimony was interpreted as raising the odds of a tightening of

monetary policy over the medium term, but they retreated later in

response to weaker-than-expected economic news, passage of the deficit

reduction package, and, most recently, favorable price readings for

July. On balance over the intermeeting period, money market rates are

unchanged and intermediate-term yields are down about 5 basis points,

while yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds have fallen as

much as 35 basis points. Stock prices have increased 1-1/2 to

3 percent. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which tend to move with

intermediate-term Treasuries, are down 6 basis points from around the

time of the July FOMC meeting.

(2) The dollar's weighted average exchange value rose 1-1/4

percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. The dollar strength-

ened slightly against the German mark, but rose more against most other

ERM currencies after the allowed margins of fluctuation were greatly

widened in response to massive selling pressures on the French franc and

1. To take account of the summer upswing in seasonal borrowing,
the Desk's allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the
discount window was raised to $225 million and then to $250 million at
the start of the first and second maintenance periods, respectively,
after the FOMC meeting. Adjustment and seasonal borrowing averaged
just below its allowance in these two maintenance periods, before
surging over the first weekend of the current period owing to computer
problems at a large bank.

several other currencies at the end of July. The prospect of more ex-

pansionary monetary policies after the bands were widened, especially by

non-German ERM monetary authorities, not only weakened those currencies

but also resulted in strong rallies in the domestic bond and stock mar-

kets of those countries. Since the widening, however, monetary authori-

ties have been cautious in relaxing policies, and short-term rates out-

side of Germany are generally still above their levels at the time of

the last FOMC meeting. In Germany, by contrast, three-month interest

rates declined 85 basis points over the intermeeting period, reflecting

some actual and further anticipated easings, despite the Bundesbank's

decision not to cut its discount rate in late July; long-term rates

decreased 30 basis points. With continued focus on Japan's trade sur-

plus, the dollar depreciated 5-1/4 percent against the yen, reaching a

new record low below Y102; the change in the Japanese government had

only a temporary depressing effect on the yen. Japanese short-term

rates declined 15 basis points, while long rates fell 30 basis points.

The Desk did not intervene in exchange markets during the period;

(3) The growth rates of M2 in June and July averaged 1-3/4

percent, leaving this aggregate a shade under the 1 percent lower bound

of its downward-revised annual range. Although growth was only a bit

below the subdued pace foreseen in the last bluebook, it was supported

to a greater degree than anticipated by identifiable special factors.

These included surprisingly robust mortgage refinancings, which boosted

demand deposits, and the purchase of Chicago Research and Trading (CRT),

a nonbank primary dealer, by NationsBank, which boosted the level of



-3-

bank RPs. Underlying growth in M2 thus was somewhat weaker than fore-

seen. Nominal income during the second quarter expanded more slowly

than the staff had forecast; moreover, flows to bond and stock mutual

funds strengthened in June and anecdotal evidence suggests they remained

brisk in July.3  M1 growth averaged 10-1/2 percent over the two

months, with each of its components posting average growth rates in the

low double digits. 4

(4) M3 contracted at a 1-3/4 percent rate over June and July,

compared with the modest increase predicted in the last bluebook. Since

the fourth quarter of last year, M3 has declined at about a 1/2 percent

rate, leaving it below the lower edge of its newly reduced 0 to 4 per-

cent annual growth rate range. The weakness in M3 over June and July

partly reflected a substantial drop in institution-only money market

mutual funds, whose returns had not kept pace with the increase in money

market rates in late spring. Also damping M3 growth, depositories in-

creased their reliance on various nondeposit sources of funds, including

borrowings from abroad, equity, and subordinated debt. Bank credit

edged down from a 9-1/2 percent growth rate in June to an 8-1/2 percent

rate in July. The expansion in July would have been only half as rapid

had not NationsBank's purchase of CRT boosted the U.S. government

securities and security loans components of bank credit.

(5) Credit flows to nonfederal sectors have strengthened a bit

in recent months. In the household sector, consumer credit picked up

somewhat in June, and consumer loans at banks in July--the only data

3. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds (excluding institutional
holdings and IRA/Keogh accounts) is estimated to have grown at a 5-3/4
percent rate in June. Growth in this augmented aggregate from the
fourth quarter of last year to June was at a 4-1/2 percent rate,
matching its rate of expansion over the four quarters of last year.

4. Total reserves and the monetary base grew at 7-1/4 and 10-1/4
percent rates, respectively over June and July.



available--continued to grow briskly. With a strengthening of home

sales and some equity extraction involved in heightened mortgage re-

financing activity, net mortgage borrowing by households likely also

firmed in June. Net borrowing by businesses evidently has been

moderate. Responding to lower long-term yields and elevated equity

prices, corporations offered a substantial volume of bonds, including

some 50- and 100-year issues, and equity. Much of the proceeds of this

activity was earmarked for repaying previously issued high-cost bonds as

well as bank loans, which dropped last month after two months of expan-

sion. Businesses are apparently finding securities markets quite recep-

tive: Quality spreads, already low, have narrowed further, reflecting

firms' improved financial conditions and perhaps also a willingness of

investors to take on more risk in their attempt to improve on available

deposit returns and to replace higher-yielding securities that matured

or were retired. In addition, banks have shown a greater willingness to

lend to businesses: A larger fraction of domestic bank respondents to

the August lending practices survey reported some easing of standards

and terms on business loans over the preceding three months than did so

in May. Overall debt of nonfederal nonfinancial sectors grew at a 4

percent rate again in June, bringing its rate of expansion since the

fourth quarter to 3-1/4 percent. With federal debt increasing at a

10-1/2 percent rate over the same period, total domestic nonfinancial

debt rose at a 5 percent rate from its fourth quarter base through June,

in the lower half of its newly specified 4 to 8 percent annual monitor-

ing range.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Three alternatives are presented below for consideration

by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 3 percent in association with an allowance for adjustment

plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million.5 Under alternative A, the

federal funds rate would decline to 2-1/2 percent, either through a drop

in the borrowing allowance to $225 million or a cut in the discount rate

of 50 basis points in combination with an unchanged level of borrowing.

Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise to 3-1/2 percent

accompanying a boost in adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to $275 mil-

lion.

(7) Market participants are not expecting a change in policy

over the relatively short upcoming intermeeting period. Thus, under

alternative B, short-term interest rates should remain around current

levels in the weeks ahead. The prime rate, at 6 percent, is unlikely to

move, as banks' increased willingness to lend will probably take the

form of narrower spreads relative to benchmark rates and more attractive

nonprice terms. Although the passage of the deficit reduction package

has removed one element of uncertainty, questions remain about its

effects, suggesting that rates could be quite sensitive to information

bearing on household and business spending. Currently, market partici-

pants appear to be anticipating a tightening of monetary policy by early

next year, on the presumption that short-term rates will have to move up

to forestall any incipient buildup of inflation pressures. Given these

expectations, intermediate- and perhaps long-term rates could drift

lower if, in line with the staff economic forecast, incoming indicators

point to more subdued spending and inflationary pressures than now seem

5. The flood in the Mississippi River basin and its aftermath are
expected to have little effect on discount window borrowing.



built into market expectations; in such circumstances, market partici-

pants would likely see tightening actions as being pushed further into

the future. The dollar should trade around recent levels on foreign

exchange markets, with any downward pressure from possible declines in

U.S. interest rates being balanced by projected reductions in rates

abroad.

(8) The interest rates under alternative B are consistent with

those of the staff Greenbook forecast, which has the federal funds rate

around current levels through 1994 and long-term rates edging lower. In

that forecast, persistent low levels of real short-term interest rates

are needed to counter fiscal drag and other impediments to economic

growth. Under these circumstances, the unemployment rate does not de-

cline from its current level, while core inflation slows only modestly.

With this configuration of income and interest rates, broad money ag-

gregates are projected to expand sluggishly while total nonfinancial

debt increases around the pace of nominal GDP.

(9) Over the balance of 1993, M2 is projected to grow at about

a 1-1/2 percent pace under alternative B, and, as shown in the table

below, to finish the year around the lower bound of its new annual

range. Although special factors that have boosted M2 growth in

recent months are seen as fading somewhat, underlying growth in this

aggregate is boosted by a little faster growth in nominal income. The

lure of capital market instruments--from the still fairly steep yield

curve and reported capital gains on securities to date--is expected to

remain strong, and inflows to mutual funds probably will stay near the

record pace of the year thus far. As a consequence, the velocity of M2

established under each of the alternatives.

is expected to increase at a 3 percent rate in the second half of the

year, only a little less than the 4 percent rate of the first half.7

M3 under alternative B is projected to bottom out in August and to edge

higher over the remainder of the year. Although bank credit growth

should slow a bit, more of it is expected to be funded by deposits,

given the very comfortable capital levels of many banks. Still, M3

would finish the year a little below its fourth-quarter 1992 base and

the lower bound of its range.

-10-

continue to ease. Nonetheless, borrowing is expected to remain con-

centrated in longer-term markets, where credit-risk premiums should

remain unusually low. In contrast, a pause in rapid federal debt growth

is anticipated in the months just ahead, as the Treasury draws on its

large cash balance before returning to the debt markets in volume later

in the year. As a consequence, growth of the total debt of domestic

nonfinancial sectors is projected to slow slightly from the first half

of the year to 4-1/2 percent over the second half, implying an increase

of 4-3/4 percent for the year as a whole.

(11) The easing under alternative A would come as a surprise

to market participants, and short-term rates would decline by the full

50 basis point drop in the funds rate. Intermediate-term rates would

decrease noticeably, and longer-term rates also would move lower, at

least in the immediate aftermath of the easing action. The fall in

longer-term nominal interest rates might be limited if inflation expec-

tations were worsened by a sense that the Federal Reserve was putting

less weight on its longer-run price stability objective. Even if

longer-term nominal rates were little affected, real rates across the

maturity structure would fall. However, unless the easing itself

prompted a more downbeat market assessment of the underlying strength of

spending, the drop in real capital market rates might be muted to some

extent by questions about how long the reduced federal funds rate could

be sustained, given its already low level in real terms.

(12) In light of the likelihood of some decline in an array of

real interest rates, as well as the real foreign exchange value of the

dollar, alternative A might be favored if economic growth in the staff

forecast were seen to be unsatisfactory and the Committee were willing

to accept little or no further disinflation. Or this option might



-11-

appear attractive if the risks to the staff forecast were seen to be

tilted significantly toward the downside, especially in view of con-

tinued fiscal drag. The lower interest rates of this alternative would

tend to boost money growth relative to alternative B and, under the

spending propensities incorporated in the staff forecast, would give a

little more assurance that the broad aggregates would finish the year at

or above the lower bounds of their ranges for 1993. Faster growth in M2

under alternative A owes both to more growth in nominal income later in

the year than under alternative B and to the improvement in the attrac-

tiveness of assets in M2 relative to money market instruments. However,

the strengthening of M2 would be only modest, because the elasticity of

this aggregate with respect to short-term interest rates now seems to be

quite small. M3 under alternative A would expand slowly over the final

four months of the year as bank credit growth remained damped in the

context of continued heavy financing in the securities markets.

(13) The tightening of policy under alternative C would come

much sooner than is now envisioned by market participants. As a conse-

quence, rates at the short end would increase by the half-point boost in

the federal funds rate. The prime rate would rise, likely by one-half

point, although a quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate might

not elicit any change in the prime rate. Intermediate-term rates, both

nominal and real, would move higher, with the extent of the increase

depending on whether market participants viewed the action as merely

moving forward the current trajectory of expected rate increases or as a

fundamentally more aggressive posture that was more certain to achieve

price stability. Perceptions of a firmer stance against inflation would

put some downward pressure on more distant forward rates, muting the



-12-

likely rise in bond yields. In any case, the dollar would move higher

on foreign exchange markets.

(14) Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw a

need to move sooner, rather than later, to contain or reduce future

inflationary pressures. An outlook for economic growth and inflation

stronger than in the staff forecast would bolster the rationale for a

policy firming action. Such an outlook might follow from a view that

the more aggressive posture being adopted by banks and other lenders

would provide, with lags, considerable stimulus to the economy and

prices. With the staff's outlook for spending propensities, M2 would

expand at only a 1 percent pace over the final five months of this year

under alternative C, ending the year about 3/4 percent above its fourth-

quarter 1992 level. Growth in this aggregate would be restrained not

only by larger opportunity costs but also by slower income growth as

year-end approached. Weaker M2 would show through to M3 which would be

about flat over the remainder of the year.
