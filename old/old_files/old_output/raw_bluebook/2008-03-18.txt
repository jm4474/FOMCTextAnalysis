MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Strains in many financial markets intensified over the intermeeting period as 

deleveraging increased in scope and depth.  Pressures resurfaced in short-term funding 

markets, with investors growing even more concerned about balance sheet capacity at large 

financial institutions.  In response, the Federal Reserve announced on March 7 and March 

11 a set of initiatives to help address term funding pressures.  In longer-term corporate 

markets, both investment- and speculative-grade credit spreads widened markedly over the 

intermeeting period, and secondary market bid prices for leveraged loans tumbled.  Issuance 

of high-yield debt securities continued to be weak, but investment-grade bond issuance was 

robust.  Equity prices declined, on net, with financial stocks especially hard hit.  Spreads of 

rates on conforming mortgage products over those on comparable-maturity Treasury 

securities widened significantly, but issuance of agency residential mortgage-backed 

securities (RMBS) continued to be strong.  In contrast, issuance of RMBS backed by 

nonconforming loans remained near nil.  Against the backdrop of tightening financial 

conditions and a deteriorating economic outlook, market participants lowered their expected 

path for the federal funds rate and are now virtually certain of at least 50 basis points of 

easing at the March FOMC meeting.   

Money Markets  

(2) Pressures reemerged in short-term funding markets over the intermeeting period.  

After having narrowed following the introduction of the TAF and the uneventful turn of the 

year, spreads of Libor and term federal funds rates over rates on comparable-maturity 

overnight index swaps (OIS) began widening again, perhaps in anticipation of further 



 
 

possible writedowns at financial institutions, of potential funding pressures stemming from 

continued dislocations in markets for structured municipal products, and possibly of the 

approach of the quarter-end (Chart 1).  Consistent with continuing funding pressures, the 

fifth, sixth, and seventh TAF auctions attracted more demand than the January auctions; the 

lack of dollar operations by the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank in 

February may have contributed some to the increase in auction participation.  In the 

commercial paper market, spreads of rates on lower-rated nonfinancial unsecured paper 

over those on AA nonfinancial paper climbed over the intermeeting period.  Spreads of 

rates on AA-rated asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) over those on AA financial paper 

have increased by a smaller amount, on net.  After having expanded in January, ABCP 

outstanding decreased some, on balance, over the intermeeting period, while unsecured CP 

outstanding changed little.   

(3) Strains reappeared in the Treasury bill market in recent weeks.  Three-month 

Treasury bill yields declined 93 basis points over the intermeeting period, reflecting the 

downward revision to the expected path of monetary policy and safe haven flows that were 

reportedly heavy at times.  Signs of dislocation were also prominent in the repo market.  

Amid robust demand for Treasury collateral, the overnight general collateral repo rate was 

volatile, often dropping well below the target federal funds rate.  In addition, dealers 

increased haircuts on many securities—particularly for alt-A and subprime MBS but also for 

agency MBS and even for Treasuries, which had traditionally been perceived as a very safe 

asset class.  Credit limits were also being reportedly reduced as dealers became concerned 

that some counterparties—especially highly leveraged funds—may not have sufficient 

capital to weather the current environment of asset price declines, exceptional price 

volatility, and market illiquidity.  Finally, financing rates were increased as dealers passed on 

elevated funding costs to customers.  Tighter lending terms in the repo market resulted in 

widespread margin calls.  Most investors were able to meet them, but some, including a 

high-profile traded mortgage fund and a medium-sized mortgage lender, were not.

Meanwhile, lending from the SOMA securities portfolio remained elevated.  Likely reflecting 

in part developments in short-term funding markets, as well as investors’ increasing 

concerns about balance sheet capacity, credit default swap (CDS) spreads for banks and 

especially for broker-dealers have widened sharply in recent weeks. 

(4) In response to strains in the interbank and repo markets, the Federal Reserve 

announced on March 7 that it would increase the size of the two upcoming TAF auctions, 

that it would hold such auctions for at least the next six months unless evolving market 

conditions clearly indicated that such auctions were no longer necessary, and that it would 

initiate a series of 28-day term repurchase transactions against a single tranche consisting of 

Treasury, agency, and agency MBS collateral.  On March 11, the Federal Reserve announced 

an expansion of its securities lending program under which primary dealers could borrow 

Treasury securities for a 28-day period using agency, agency MBS, or AAA-rated private-

label MBS as collateral.  In addition, the FOMC authorized an increase in its existing 

temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss 

National Bank, and those central banks announced a resumption of dollar auctions for 

institutions in their jurisdictions.  Overall, short-term funding markets showed some early 

signs of improvement as a result of the Federal Reserve’s initiatives.  For example, spreads 

of Libor and term federal funds rates over rates on comparable-maturity OIS reversed some 

of their earlier increases.  (See box “Recent Federal Reserve Initiatives to Address Short-

term Liquidity.”)   

Longer-term Corporate Markets 

(5) Broad equity indexes continued to be volatile and ended the period down about 

3½ percent on concerns about credit market developments and the implications of negative 

economic news for corporate earnings.  Financial sector stocks were particularly hard hit, 

declining about 13 percent.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-

price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the

Recent Federal Reserve Initiatives to Address Short-term Liquidity 

 
 Recently, conditions in short-term funding markets, particularly interbank and repurchase 
agreement (repo) markets, have deteriorated.  Increased demand for dollar liquidity led term Libor-OIS 
spreads, which had narrowed considerably since mid-December, to widen again in mid-February.  At the 
same time, an accelerating pullback from mortgage-related assets and heightened demand for Treasury 
securities created dislocations and volatility in collateralized lending markets.  In response to these 
developments and general strains in market functioning in a number of financial markets, on March 7, the 
Federal Reserve announced that it would increase its lending volume through the Term Auction Facility 
(TAF) and that the Desk would begin a series of 28-day, single-tranche repo transactions.  On March 11, 
the Federal Reserve announced that it would create a new Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), and 
that the FOMC had extended and increased currency swap lines with the European Central Bank (ECB) 
and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). 
 
 To ease pressures in dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve announced that the total dollar 
value offered at each March TAF auction would be increased to $50 billion, and stated that, unless market 
conditions clearly indicated that the auctions were to become unnecessary, it would continue the TAF for 
at least six months.  The first such auction, held on March 10, was well subscribed.  The FOMC also 
authorized an increase to $30 billion in the currency swap arrangement with the ECB and an increase to 
$6 billion in the arrangement with the SNB.  These central banks announced that they would resume 
auctions on March 25 and that they would continue to provide dollar liquidity for as long as they deemed 
necessary.   
 

The Federal Reserve also initiated a series of 28-day repos in which dealers are able to deliver as 
collateral any of the types of securities that are eligible as collateral in conventional operations, and the 
highest rates bid, regardless of collateral, win the auction.  Cumulating to $100 billion, these operations 
should allow dealers to finance mortgage-backed securities (MBS) more easily, and the first operation, 
conducted on Friday, March 7, received propositions exclusively for MBS collateral.  In addition, the 
Federal Reserve’s new $200 billion TSLF will lend Treasury securities from the SOMA portfolio to 
primary dealers for a term of up to 28 days against agency debt, agency-backed MBS, and AAA/Aaa-rated 
private-label MBS.  This new facility allows dealers to substitute less-liquid securities for Treasury 
securities. 

 
To maintain the overnight federal funds rate near the target rate, the Desk must drain an amount 

of balances that is roughly equal to the reserves provided by the TAF and the single-tranche term repos.  
The Desk has a variety of tools, including reducing the quantity of other repos outstanding, redeeming 
Treasury securities, and selling Treasury securities on an outright basis from the SOMA portfolio.  Indeed, 
on March 7, for the first time since 1990, the Desk sold Treasury bills in the open market, and it sold 
additional bills on March 12.  These operations will leave an even greater supply of sought-after Treasury 
securities at dealers’ disposal. 

 
Market participants’ response to these initiatives has generally been positive.  Dollar Libor-OIS 

spreads narrowed noticeably in response to the first auction of the expanded TAF.  In the cash MBS 
market, spreads to Treasuries also came in notably, suggesting that the recent and prospective shifts in 
relative market supply of Treasury securities to other, less liquid assets has promoted market functioning.  
And on the day of the announcement of the TSLF and the extended currency swap lines, equity markets 
rallied and interest rates rose reflecting improved sentiment.  Apparently, some market participants view 
these initiatives as a partial substitute to easing of the federal funds rate for the Federal Reserve to address 
liquidity and market functioning difficulties.

equity risk premium—remained at the upper end of its range over the past two decades.  

Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index continued to be high by historical standards.  

(6) In the corporate bond market, yields on both investment- and speculative-grade 

issues rose markedly over the intermeeting period, even as longer-term Treasury yields 

declined.  As a result, spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened about 

45 and 60 basis points, respectively, and they are now at their highest levels since 2002.  The 

widening in spreads primarily reflected a rise in near-term forward spreads, suggesting 

increased concerns among investors about prospects for credit quality.  CDS spreads rose 

for nonfinancial firms, but by noticeably less than for financial firms.  Issuance of 

investment-grade bonds was robust in February, but very few high-yield bonds were issued.  

In the secondary market, liquidity conditions reportedly deteriorated, although trading 

volumes have increased since late last year.  Strains were also apparent in the CDS market, 

where unusually wide ranges of dealer quotes for the same reference entities suggested that 

liquidity and price discovery were impaired.  While in the second half of last year this 

problem affected mainly financial institutions, so far this year dealer quotes have been sparse 

for nonfinancial institutions as well. 

(7) In the leveraged loan market, banks reportedly continued to face severe difficulties 

syndicating to investors previously underwritten loans used to finance large LBO deals, and 

the pipeline of leveraged loans stayed elevated.  Meanwhile, secondary market bid prices for 

leveraged loans tumbled over the intermeeting period (Chart 2).  This sharp price 

deterioration apparently reflected a combination of factors, including concerns about credit 

quality, reduced investor interest following the decline in Libor rates, and reported unwinds 

of positions by leveraged investors and market value collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).  

Liquidity also apparently deteriorated:  The average bid-asked spread on leveraged 

syndicated loans widened about 40 basis points, to 206 basis points, and it is now well above 

the peak reached last August.  An index of CDS on leveraged syndicated loans (the LCDX 

index) increased more than 60 basis points, on net.  In the CLO market, spreads have

widened sharply across the capital structure since the January FOMC meeting and new 

issuance has remained extremely weak.  Likely reflecting the sharp price deterioration in the 

loan market, prime rate loan funds reportedly continued to experience outflows. 

The Municipal Bond Market and Money Market Mutual Funds   

(8) Ratios of municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasury yields climbed 

over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting investors’ concerns about the conditions 

of financial guarantors and some softening in the fiscal outlook for local and state 

governments.  Issuance of municipal bonds slowed in February.  CDS spreads of financial 

guarantors remained elevated, on balance, even though rating agencies have recently 

reaffirmed the AAA ratings of the largest two firms.  

(9) Concerns about the conditions of financial guarantors had important implications 

for the functioning of the markets for structured municipal products.  In the auction rate 

securities (ARS) market, many auctions failed as broker-dealers did not step in to support 

them when investor demand largely vanished in response to concerns about the guarantors, 

and interest rates reset, often to very high penalty rates.  The market for variable-rate 

demand notes (VRDNs) also experienced unprecedented volatility, apparently prompted in 

part by the possible effect of financial guarantors’ downgrades on liquidity arrangements 

incorporated in these securities.  Reflecting similar concerns, dislocations were significant 

also in the tender option bond (TOB) market, where unwinds have accelerated in recent 

weeks.   

(10) Tax-exempt money market mutual funds (MMMFs) have reportedly been 

reducing their holdings of some structured municipal products on perceived weakness in the 

liquidity provisions supporting these products. Nevertheless, MMMFs overall have 

continued to experience very large inflows—comparable to those they attracted last August 

at the beginning of the ongoing turmoil in financial markets—likely reflecting a flight toward 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 8 of 39



 
 

relatively safe assets and perhaps recent policy rate cuts, which reduce the rates available to 

new fund investors only gradually. 

Mortgage Markets   

(11) Interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages increased 65 basis 

points over the intermeeting period, while rates on one-year adjustable-rate conforming 

loans rose 15 basis points.  As a result, spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury securities 

widened markedly.  Posted offer rates on thirty-year jumbo mortgages have also increased 

since the January FOMC meeting, and such credit continued to be difficult to obtain.  

Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) backed by nonconforming loans 

dried up.  By contrast, issuance of agency MBS securities stayed strong.   

(12) Liquidity conditions for private-label RMBS—especially alt-A securities—

worsened significantly starting in mid-February; prices dropped sharply as dealers began 

imposing much higher haircuts when funding such positions, and some investors were 

reportedly forced to scale back their holdings.  Significant signs of stress were also evident in 

the agency MBS market.  Bid-asked spreads widened, and option-adjusted spreads (OAS) 

over Treasuries surged to the highest levels in many years, reportedly reflecting in part 

investor deleveraging amid tighter financing terms and the large supply of securities coming 

to market.  Market participants also pointed to anxiety about the size of GSE losses as a 

reason for the decline in liquidity in the agency MBS market.  However, OAS spreads 

continued to increase even after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released their earnings reports 

in late February and their regulator announced that it would lift limits on their portfolio 

growth that it had previously put in place.  The increase in the agencies’ CDS spreads was 

also steep over the period.  Spreads widened sharply even on Ginnie Mae’s MBS, which 

carry a U.S. government guarantee, pointing to investors’ heightened aversion to mortgage 

products.  In recent days, however, agency spreads retraced some of their earlier increases, 

as investors apparently judged that the Federal Reserve’s initiatives could help return some 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 9 of 39



 
 

liquidity to agency mortgage markets.  In the market for commercial mortgage-backed 

securities, issuance continued to be negligible, while spreads over swap rates widened even 

further over the intermeeting period. 

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(13) With the exception of the announcement of the Term Securities Lending Facility, 

Federal Reserve actions and communications over the intermeeting period generally elicited 

only modest market reactions.  The FOMC’s decision at its January meeting to reduce the 

target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent was widely anticipated.1  

Subsequently, the downward revision to the growth outlook and the upward revision to the 

inflation outlook contained in the summary of economic projections released with the 

FOMC minutes apparently did not surprise market participants, and investors reportedly 

viewed the Chairman’s monetary policy testimony at the end of February as in line with 

recent FOMC communications.  However, in response to the Federal Reserve’s 

announcement on March 11, the expected path for policy firmed temporarily, as market 

participants apparently saw the favorable effects of the expansion of the securities lending 

program as likely to reduce the need for policy easing.  Inflation data releases were 

disappointing over the intermeeting period, but the softness in real-side economic data, 

deteriorating financial market conditions, and concerns about some large financial 

institutions evidently were interpreted by market participants as suggesting that more policy 

easing than previously foreseen would be forthcoming.  On net, market participants now 

expect the funds rate to decline to about 1.75 percent late this year, about 50 basis points 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.99 percent over the intermeeting period with elevated 
volatility, comparable to that seen in recent months.  Over the period, the volume of long-term RPs 
increased $36 billion, primarily reflecting the introduction of the new 28-day, single-tranche RP 
program.  The Desk redeemed $10 billion in Treasury bills and sold $25 billion on an outright basis.  
The reduction in holdings of Treasury securities offset the provision of balances through the Term 
Auction Facility and the twenty-eight-day RP program. 
 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 10 of 39



 
 

more than at the time of the January meeting (Chart 3).  Judging from quotes on federal 

funds target binary options, investors are now virtually certain of a rate cut of 50 basis 

points or more at the upcoming FOMC meeting and attach about a 40 percent probability 

to a half-point of easing.  Respondents to the Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers—

which was conducted before the March 11 announcement—were about evenly split between 

a 50 and a 75 basis point cut.  A majority of the primary dealer economists anticipated the 

language of the statement released after the upcoming FOMC meeting to be similar to the 

January 30 statement.  On balance, uncertainty about the path for policy remains elevated.  

The option-implied distributions of the federal funds rate between six and twelve months 

ahead are now skewed to the downside and show non-negligible odds of very low interest 

rates. 

(14) Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities dropped 59 basis points, on net, 

over the intermeeting period; ten-year Treasury yields declined 9 basis points.  Liquidity 

continued to be somewhat impaired in the Treasury coupon market, with bid-asked spreads 

staying elevated.  The spread between yields on on-the-run and off-the-run five- and ten-

year Treasury notes remained very wide, at levels not seen since 2002.  Trading volumes 

were exceptionally high in January, but receded in February.  The forward term structure of 

TIPS yields steepened sharply; the decline in real forward rates at short horizons is 

consistent with the downward revision in the economic outlook.   

(15) Forward TIPS-based inflation compensation increased across the term structure 

over the intermeeting period.  Five-year inflation compensation adjusted for carry effects 

rose 9 basis points amid higher-than-expected inflation data releases and sharp increases in 

commodity prices including oil, while five-year inflation compensation five years forward 

moved up 19 basis points.  The increase in inflation compensation may reflect in part an 

increase in inflation expectations and inflation risk premiums.  (See box “Long-Run 

Inflation Expectations and Uncertainty.”)

Long-Run Inflation Expectations and Uncertainty 
 

 

 

Several financial market and survey-based indicators of long-run inflation expectations and uncertainty have moved 
up since the start of this year.  Most notably, inflation compensation derived from comparing the nominal and TIPS 
yield curves has risen across the term structure:  The four-to-five-year forward rate of inflation compensation has 
climbed about 15 basis points since the start of the year, and the five-to-ten-year forward rate has increased by almost 
50 basis points.  About half of the rise in the five-to-ten-year forward rate occurred in narrow windows around the 
two January FOMC policy announcements, the releases of higher-than-expected consumer and producer price data, 
and speeches by FOMC participants which emphasized the Committee’s concerns about downside risks to growth.  
The increase in inflation compensation likely primarily reflects some combination of increases in inflation 
expectations and uncertainty, with the latter leading to higher inflation risk premiums.  (To the extent that strains in 
financial markets have caused investors to prefer the relative liquidity of nominal Treasury securities, this would tend 
to put downward pressure on their yields and so lower measured inflation compensation.  However, if the liquidity 
effects were especially pronounced at the front end of the nominal yield curve they could act to boost the five-to-ten-
year forward rate measure of inflation compensation.)   

A number of other indicators also suggest greater nervousness about longer-term inflation prospects.  Nine-to-ten-
year nominal forward rates have risen to their highest levels since the middle of 2004, perhaps in part reflecting 
concerns about the inflation outlook.  Moreover, dealers report increased investor interest in inflation cap contracts, 
which offer insurance against inflation rising above a specified high rate, typically between 3½ percent and 4½ 
percent.  Although this market remains very thin, the prices of these caps have reportedly risen in recent months, 
consistent with higher expected inflation and greater inflation uncertainty.  In a similar vein, inflows into inflation-
protected bond funds increased sharply in January.  By contrast, recent survey measures of expected inflation have 
been mixed.  The February Survey of Professional Forecasters reported increases in both long-run inflation 
expectations and inflation uncertainty; likewise, the Desk survey of primary dealers in recent months has pointed to an 
edging up in long-run expected inflation.   However, the March Blue Chip Economic Indicators and the February 
Reuters/University of Michigan Survey showed little change in longer-run inflation expectations since the start of the 
year, although the Michigan survey does suggest that long-run inflation expectations have moved up since the autumn. 

All measures of inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty are imperfect and noisy.  As a result, a more reliable 
guide to developments in underlying inflation concerns may be gained by considering the common movement in a 
range of measures.  An index of inflation expectations and uncertainty, constructed as the first principal component 
of fourteen different inflation indicators, declined sharply during the period of disinflation in the 1990s and has since 
remained in a relatively narrow range.  The indicators employed include TIPS-based inflation compensation, survey 
measures of expectations, and survey measures of inflation uncertainty and the dispersion of expectations.  Although 
the index remains within the range seen over the past ten years or so, it has moved up since the start of the year.  This 
development is consistent with the staff’s assessment that although longer-term inflation expectations still appear 
reasonably well anchored, concerns about future inflation have increased somewhat in recent months.

Foreign Developments 

(16)  European interbank term money markets showed less evidence of stress during 

most of the intermeeting period than did U.S. markets.  Although Libor-OIS spreads for 

both euro and sterling moved up, on balance, the net increases were less than those in dollar 

term markets.  Earlier discontinuation of dollar auctions by the European Central Bank 

(ECB) and Swiss National Bank (SNB) may have driven some European borrowers into 

U.S. markets and contributed to higher dollar spreads.  On March 11, in actions coordinated 

among G10 central banks, the ECB and SNB announced that they would resume their 

dollar auctions and increase their size, consistent with the expansion of their currency swap 

lines with the Federal Reserve.  Also as part of the coordinated actions, the Bank of England 

and the Bank of Canada announced measures designed to address strains in term money 

markets in their own currencies.  Following the announcements, Libor-OIS dollar spreads 

declined, but European spreads showed little reaction.  Trading conditions in the FX swap 

market continued to be somewhat strained during the intermeeting period.  The outstanding 

amount of European asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to decline over the 

intermeeting period and is now roughly half what it was as the beginning of the current 

financial turmoil. 

(17)  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies 

moved down about 3½ percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period amid growing 

concerns about distress in U.S. financial markets, cumulating signs of weakness in the U.S. 

economy, and increasing expectations of further aggressive action by the Federal Reserve 

(Chart 4).  News on foreign economic developments—as well as assessments of the health 

of foreign financial markets and institutions—tended to be less negative.  Yields on two-year 

euro-area government securities declined noticeably less than did comparable yields on two-

year U.S. Treasuries (only about 20 basis points versus roughly 60 basis points for U.S. 

yields).  Yields on long-term government securities in advanced foreign economies declined 

10 to 40 basis points.  The dollar dropped more than 5 percent against the euro and yen, but

only about 2 percent versus sterling and 1 percent against the Canadian dollar.  Both the 

Bank of Canada and the Bank of England lowered policy rates (by 50 and 25 basis points, 

respectively) during the period.  The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank left 

policy rates unchanged, and ECB officials highlighted their concerns about intensifying 

inflationary pressures.2   Headline share price indexes registered widespread declines of 1 to 

5 percent in Europe and Japan, and financial stocks experienced steeper falls, including a 15 

percent price decline for Japanese bank stocks.   Most major emerging markets continue to 

be relatively unscathed by the financial turmoil and the growing worries about global 

economic growth.  Though risk spreads on emerging market sovereign debt widened 

somewhat and stock prices in some emerging market economies experienced modest 

declines, share prices moved up in Mexico, Brazil, Korea, and Thailand.  The dollar fell on 

balance about 1¼ percent against an index of currencies of our other important trading 

partners. 

Debt and Money 

(18) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to be expanding at an annual rate 

of about 5¼ percent in the current quarter, a marked slowdown from the pace recorded in 

the fourth quarter of last year (Chart 5).  Growth of nonfinancial business debt is projected 

to moderate to a rate of 5½ percent this quarter, as the previously torrid growth of C&I 

loans has slowed substantially—damped in part by significantly weaker M&A activity—and 

as funding in both the high-yield bond market and the leveraged loan market has come 

nearly to a halt—especially for large LBO deals.  In the household sector, mortgage debt 

growth is expected to decelerate further to about 3½ percent in the first quarter, held down 

by falling house prices, declining home sales, and tighter credit conditions for most types of 

loans.  Consumer credit growth is projected to expand roughly 3 percent this quarter.  

                                           
2   There were no foreign official purchases or sales of dollars by reporting central banks in industrial 
countries during the intermeeting period.

(19) M2 advanced at a rapid 12½ percent annual rate, on average, in January and 

February.  Likely reflecting continued demand for safety and liquidity, retail money funds 

grew at a 61 percent pace in February.  Liquid deposits also accelerated noticeably in 

February, as the opportunity cost of holding these assets has fallen in recent months.  With 

several thrift institutions offering aggressive deposit rates to attract funding, growth in small 

time deposits picked up in January, although it moderated in February.  After three months 

of contraction reflecting weak demand from overseas investors, currency expanded 

moderately in February.  In recent quarters, the opportunity cost of holding M2 has fallen 

steeply while the velocity of M2 has declined only slightly, bringing these variables closer to 

their historical relationship.

Economic Outlook 

(20) The staff has marked down appreciably its outlook for growth in 2008 in 

response to steeper-than-anticipated declines in home prices, a sharp deterioration in 

business and consumer sentiment, a marked softening of labor markets, higher oil prices, 

and a further tightening of credit conditions.  As a consequence, the forecast now assumes 

that the Committee will ease policy 50 basis points at this meeting, another 50 basis points 

in April, and 25 basis points at the June meeting, and then maintain the funds rate at 1¾ 

percent through the end of 2009.  With that path for policy, longer-term Treasury yields 

have been revised down about 10 basis points over the rest of this year and 25 basis points 

in 2009.  The overall contour for long-term interest rates, however, is similar to that 

projected in January, with the yield on the ten-year Treasury note edging up as the ten-year 

window moves past the especially low short-term interest rates this year and next.  Stock 

prices rise at an annual rate of about 6¼ percent over the remainder of this year from a 

starting point that is a bit lower than anticipated in the previous forecast and are expected 

to climb at an annual rate of 11¼ percent next year as the equity premium starts to decline 

toward more normal levels in response to dissipating macroeconomic risks; because the 

staff pushed back the assumed beginning of the decline in the equity premium by a few 

quarters, equity prices at the end of 2009 are about 6 percent lower than in the previous 

Greenbook.  The trade-weighted dollar is assumed to depreciate at a 4¼ percent average 

annual rate over the remainder of 2008 and about 3 percent in 2009.  In line with futures 

quotes, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil is expected to average about $102 

per barrel over the forecast period, about $15 per barrel higher than in the previous 

Greenbook.   

(21) Against this background, real GDP is projected to contract at about a  

½ percent rate during the first half of this year; subsequently, fiscal stimulus and the lagged 

effects of monetary policy easing engender a gradual recovery, with real GDP projected to 

expand at a ¾ percent rate in the second half of 2008.  For 2008 as a whole, real GDP is 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 19 of 39



 
 

projected to be essentially flat, a downward revision in the rate of growth of almost 1½ 

percentage points relative to the January forecast.  With the contractionary effects of 

higher oil prices and financial turmoil waning, economic growth picks up to about 3 

percent in 2009, about ¾ percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the rate of 

expansion of potential GDP.  As a consequence of economic weakness over the next 

several quarters, the unemployment rate rises to almost 5¾ percent by the end of 2008—a 

full percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU—and then declines to 5½ 

percent by the end of 2009.  The forecast for total PCE inflation during the first half of 

this year has been revised up substantially, from around 2½ percent to about 4 percent, 

largely reflecting higher oil prices.  However, the assumed flattening out of energy and 

other commodity prices, combined with the expected deceleration in import prices and 

persistent slack in product and labor markets, pushes headline inflation down to about 1¾ 

percent by the third quarter of this year.  The path for core PCE inflation is a bit above the 

January projection, mainly owing to elevated recent monthly readings on inflation and 

some assumed deterioration in the public’s expectations of future inflation.  All told, the 

staff expects core PCE inflation to average 2¼ percent this year and a bit below 2 percent 

in 2009.   

Update on Monetary Policy Strategies 

(22) Since the January Bluebook, the Greenbook-consistent and FRB/US model-

based estimates of short-run r* have declined sharply and now stand at -0.5 and -0.1 

percent, respectively (Chart 6).  These measures are now about 1¼ percent below our 

measure of the current real federal funds rate.  These substantially lower estimates reflect 

the downward revision to the staff’s outlook for aggregate demand.  In the small structural 

model, the recent declines in stock and house prices, coupled with higher spreads on 

corporate debt, also prompted a sharp decline in short-run r*; that estimate now stands at -

1.1 percent.  In contrast, the estimate obtained from the single equation model remains

positive and has shifted down only 30 basis points; this measure depends only on current 

and lagged values of the output gap and not on financial conditions or other leading 

indicators of aggregate demand.  

(23) Chart 7 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2009.  In these simulations, 

policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal, 

on keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in the 

nominal federal funds rate.3  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of 

charts), the simulation prescribes a nominal federal funds rate that declines to around 2¼ 

percent by late next year and then rises toward 3¾ percent by the end of 2012.  With an 

inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate falls more 

sharply, dipping to near 1¼ percent by the end of 2009 before rising to about 4 percent by 

2012.  Under either inflation goal, for the next two years these prescriptions are around 

100 basis points lower than those shown in the previous Bluebook, mainly reflecting the 

much weaker outlook for aggregate demand in the current forecast, as manifested in 

upward revisions to the unemployment rate paths from 2008 through 2010.  Despite this 

additional slack, the paths for core inflation are also above those shown in the January 

Bluebook, reflecting unexpectedly high readings on inflation, recent increases in the prices 

of oil and imported goods, and signs that inflation expectations may have moved up a bit 

relative to the time of the last meeting.   

(24) The outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes a funds rate path that 

declines to around 2 percent by the fourth quarter of this year, then fluctuates between 2 

and 3 percent over the next several years (Chart 8).  Through the end of 2009, this 

projection is, on average, around 100 basis points lower than the trajectory in the January 

                                           
3  In conducting these simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are assumed to 
understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by the extended 
Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations using more limited 
information.

Bluebook.  According to financial market quotes, investors anticipate that the funds rate 

will decline to around 1¾ percent by the end of this year and then progressively rise to 

slightly below 4 percent by the end of 2012.  The confidence intervals on interest rate caps 

indicate some odds of a funds rate as low as 1 percent by the end of 2008.  The near-term 

prescriptions from the simple policy rules proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) are lower than 

those shown in January Bluebook, but remain well above the current target rate and the 

prescriptions of the estimated outcome-based rule.  These higher prescriptions presumably 

reflect that these rules do not include a lagged interest rate, and also that they do not take 

into account current financial market pressures and other forward-looking information 

captured by market expectations and the staff forecast.    

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(25) This Bluebook presents four policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  The underlined text shown 

in red highlights the changes from the January 30 statement, which appears on the page 

following the table.  Alternative A cuts the federal funds rate target 75 basis points to 2¼ 

percent; Alternative B cuts the target 50 basis points to 2½ percent; Alternative C lowers 

the target 25 basis points to 2¾ percent; and Alternative D leaves the target federal funds 

rate at 3 percent.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining an action from any 

one policy alternative with portions of the statement from more than one alternative. 

(26) Should the Committee share the staff’s assessment of the underlying forces 

shaping the economy and judge that the monetary stimulus already in the pipeline is 

inadequate to foster a sufficiently timely resumption of moderate economic growth, it may 

want reduce the target federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative 

B.  Even with the 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate on January 30, 

some FOMC participants noted at that meeting that they anticipated that further easing 

would be necessary to support aggregate demand.  Moreover, economic and financial news

Rationale 
3.  Inflation has been elevated, and some 
measures of inflation expectations have

energy and other commodity prices and 
an easing of pressures on resource 
utilization.  Still, uncertainty about the 
inflation outlook has increased.  It will

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 27 of 39



 
 

during the intermeeting period strongly suggests that the outlook for economic growth is 

weakening:  Strains in financial markets have intensified, and incoming data indicate that 

growth in consumer spending is flagging and labor markets are slackening, and the 

tightening of credit conditions now appears to be interacting with the deteriorating 

macroeconomic outlook in a mutually reinforcing cycle.  The Greenbook-consistent 

measure of the equilibrium real funds rate is about 1¼ percentage points below the level 

of the current real rate, suggesting that considerable further easing is necessary to bring 

output back to its potential over the medium term.  Moreover, the Committee might see 

the risks around the staff’s outlook as skewed to the downside, given the absence of 

convincing signs of a bottoming in the housing market and the possibility of a sharp 

further worsening of financial market conditions.  At the same time, however, the short-

run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation apparently has deteriorated, and 

policymakers’ confidence that inflation will decline might have been eroded by the recent 

run-up in energy and other commodity prices, the fall in the exchange value of the dollar, 

and the rise in measures of inflation compensation.  In these circumstances, the 

Committee might be concerned that additional aggressive policy easing may trigger 

increases in inflation expectations that could be costly to reverse.  In view of such 

concerns, the Committee might believe that more than 50 basis points of easing before 

long may be warranted but might be reluctant to make that full adjustment at this meeting. 

(27)  The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative B would 

begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity, pointing specifically 

to the softening in consumer expenditures and labor markets.  The statement would also 

point out that financial markets remain under considerable stress and that the tightening of 

credit conditions, coupled with the deepening of the housing contraction, is likely to weigh 

on economic growth in the near term.  The paragraph on inflation would note that the 

Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters assuming “a projected 

leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 28 of 39



 
 

utilization.”  This alternative would highlight the risks that attend the Committee’s 

expectation regarding the trajectory for inflation by indicating that “uncertainty about the 

outlook for inflation has increased” and would note that the Committee “will continue to 

monitor inflation developments carefully.”  The final paragraph would repeat the 

assessment of risks from the January statement. 

(28)  Investors place roughly even odds on both 50 basis point and 75 basis 

point reductions in the target federal funds rate at this meeting.  As a result, adoption of 

Alternative B would likely cause near-term policy expectations to move somewhat higher.  

Equity prices might decline, and yield spreads on private-debt instruments over those on 

Treasuries could widen, should market participants conclude that monetary policy was not 

being eased sufficiently promptly to cushion adequately the weakness in economic activity.  

Any such adverse effects, however, would likely be tempered by the Committee’s 

acknowledgment that the downside risks to growth remain and that the Committee is 

prepared to act in a timely manner to address those risks, a communication that would 

likely be interpreted as indicating that members are still predisposed to ease policy further.  

Given the smaller-than-expected policy move and the indication in the statement of 

greater concern about inflation risks, market participants could mark down their inflation 

expectations slightly.  Any move in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be 

relatively small.  However, in light of impaired trading conditions in many markets and 

investors’ increasingly skittish attitudes, even small policy surprises have the potential to 

generate an outsized reaction in financial markets. 

(29) If the Committee judges that the news on economic activity and financial 

markets since the January meeting has appreciably undermined the outlook for the 

economy and is reasonably confident that inflation will moderate, it might prefer to move 

more aggressively to promote growth and mitigate downside risks by cutting the funds rate 

75 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Despite the five policy moves over 

the past six months, the substantial downward revision to the Greenbook forecast suggests 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 29 of 39



 
 

that significantly more easing than previously foreseen may be required to stave off a 

severe deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.  Indeed, in light of the rapidly eroding 

financial situation in recent weeks, policymakers might see an even weaker outlook than in 

the Greenbook that would ultimately require even more policy easing than assumed in the 

staff forecast.  Alternatively, policymakers might see the cumulative 125 basis points of 

easing assumed in the staff forecast as likely to prove necessary to restore output to its 

potential, but might prefer to deliver the easing in a more rapid manner than in the staff 

forecast, in order to arrest the deterioration in investor sentiment currently afflicting 

financial markets.  The downside risks around the growth outlook might be particularly 

worrisome, given the steeper-than-expected declines in house prices and the intensification 

of strains in financial markets.  In such circumstances, the Committee might view the odds 

of an intensifying adverse feedback cycle—that is, a worsening of the macroeconomic 

situation generating further distress in financial markets and among financial institutions, 

thereby prompting a further tightening in the supply of credit and so putting further 

downward pressure on real activity—as having risen appreciably over the intermeeting 

period (a possibility suggested by the Greenbook scenario, “Greater Housing Correction 

with More Financial Fallout”).  Members might also find the case for a 75 basis point cut 

to be persuasive if they would be willing to tolerate a somewhat higher path for inflation 

than in the staff forecast in order to respond more aggressively to the prospect of 

significant weakness in output.  Instead, members might be more optimistic about the 

outlook for inflation than the staff.  For example, with the unemployment rate seen as 

likely to rise markedly, policymakers might anticipate that workers will become particularly 

concerned about job security, a situation that could restrain wage demands and reduce cost 

pressures by more than assumed in the baseline forecast (a possibility suggested by the 

“Worker Insecurity” scenario in the Greenbook).     

(30) The two paragraphs in the rationale portion of the statement associated with 

Alternative A are identical to those in Alternative B.  However, the assessment of risks 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 30 of 39



 
 

differs from that in Alternative B by noting explicitly the risks to both growth and 

inflation.  Alternative A also indicates that the Committee “judges that the downside risks 

to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation” and that the FOMC is prepared to act in 

a timely manner as needed to “promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.” 

(31) With market participants putting significant odds on both 50 basis point and 75 

basis point cuts at this meeting, selection of Alternative A would likely leave short- and 

intermediate-term interest rates a little lower.  Market participants would probably interpret 

such an aggressive interest rate cut, together with the indication that downside risks to 

growth predominate, as suggesting that the Committee is inclined to further policy easing.  

This combination might bolster market confidence, causing equity prices to rise and credit 

spreads on corporate debt to narrow some.  However, longer-term yields might move 

higher if market participants became concerned that the Committee was underestimating 

inflation risks or was more willing to tolerate higher rates of inflation going forward than 

earlier anticipated.  

(32) If the Committee believes that the economic outlook has weakened but is 

concerned that aggressive further policy easing amid unfavorable inflation readings could 

increase the likelihood of a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, it may wish to lower 

the funds rate target by just 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C.  In 

particular, this alternative might be favored if the factors underlying the recent increase in 

inflation were viewed as likely to be more persistent than envisaged in the staff’s 

projection.  In light of recent data, the Committee might see the short-run tradeoff 

between economic activity and inflation as having worsened to a greater extent than 

judged by the staff and believe that the scope for monetary policy to provide stimulus to 

growth while applying adequate restraint to inflation has decreased noticeably.  Such a 

deterioration in the short-run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation could 

reflect in part an increase in inflation expectations, as illustrated in the Greenbook’s “More 

Inflationary Pressures” scenario.  The difficulty of reliably detecting shifts in inflation 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 31 of 39



 
 

expectations may bolster the case for this alternative, especially if the Committee perceives 

an upward drift of such expectations as being very costly to unwind.   

(33) The statement accompanying Alternative C would explicitly acknowledge that 

the upside risks to inflation have increased by pointing to recent unfavorable readings on 

inflation and by emphasizing the factors that could potentially exert upward pressure on 

inflation going forward.  As under Alternative B, the statement would point out that 

members expect “inflation to moderate in coming quarters,” but would conclude that “the 

upside risks to the outlook for inflation have increased.”  The rationale paragraph for this 

alternative would also state that “recent policy actions should help to promote moderate 

growth over time, but downside risks to growth remain.”  The risk assessment would 

reflect the Committee’s judgment that “the risks to growth outweigh the risks to inflation, 

particularly in light of stresses in financial markets,”  and the statement would end by 

noting that the Committee “will act in a timely manner as needed to address the evolving 

risks.” 

(34) A decision to adopt Alternative C would come as a significant surprise to the 

financial markets.  Investors would presumably revise up sharply their expectations for the 

path of policy over the next few quarters, leading to an increase in short- and intermediate-

term interest rates.  At the same time, long-term nominal Treasury yields would likely rise 

by less or could even fall if investors concluded that the FOMC had a lower tolerance for 

inflation than they had previously thought.  With real rates higher, equities would fall, 

credit spreads on corporate debt would widen, strains in financial markets would intensify, 

and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise.   

(35) If the Committee believes that economic growth is likely to resume an 

acceptable pace before long and that inflation is on a higher trajectory than in the 

Greenbook, it might prefer to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in 

Alternative D.  Although measures of consumer and business sentiment have declined, 

the Committee might view the data on final demand as only a bit weaker than expected 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 32 of 39



 
 

and judge that financial turmoil, while posing significant risks, is likely to have less of an 

effect on aggregate demand than anticipated by the staff.  Moreover, monetary policy has 

been eased considerably and substantial fiscal stimulus has been enacted, factors that are 

likely to provide a significant boost to aggregate demand in coming quarters.  Accordingly, 

policymakers might prefer to wait for additional information about the extent of that 

boost before making any further policy adjustments.  In addition, given the recent run-up 

in energy and other commodity prices, the drop in the foreign exchange value of the 

dollar, and the apparent slight increase in long-term inflation expectations, the Committee 

might now see it as increasingly unlikely that inflation will decline at an acceptable pace 

and might believe that the upside risks to inflation have risen unacceptably.  A pause at 

this juncture might be particularly appealing to policymakers who prefer a more distinct 

downward tilt to the trajectory for inflation over the next few years than that shown in the 

Greenbook, such as that illustrated by the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal 

of 1½ percent.  

(36) The first paragraph of the rationale portion of the statement associated with 

Alternative D would acknowledge that economic activity has been weak and that financial 

markets remain under considerable stress.  It would also state that although “downside 

risks to growth remain, recent policy actions should help to promote moderate growth 

over time.”  The rationale portion pertaining to the outlook for inflation would be 

identical to that in Alternative C.  The risk assessment section in Alternative D would 

stress that the Committee “will act in a timely manner as needed to promote price stability 

and sustainable economic growth.”   

(37) Given the expectations embedded in financial market prices of further 

substantial policy easing at this meeting, a decision to adopt Alternative D would stun 

market participants, leading to a sharp upward revision of their short-term outlook for the 

path of policy and a significant increase in short-term interest rates.  Despite the indication 

in the announcement that recent policy actions should help to promote moderate growth 

Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 33 of 39



 
 

over time, investors would likely become gravely concerned about the economic outlook, a 

development that would cause credit spreads on corporate debt to widen substantially, 

market functioning to deteriorate further, equity prices to tumble, and longer-term 

nominal yields to decline.   

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(38) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to grow 9 percent this year, a 

pace of expansion that significantly exceeds that of the nominal GDP.  The sharp decline 

in velocity reflects the projection of a continued shift in the composition of households’ 

portfolios toward safe and liquid monetary assets at the expense of capital market 

instruments in response to ongoing financial turmoil and the substantial fall in the 

opportunity cost of M2 assets resulting from monetary policy easing.  In 2009, M2 growth 

is projected to drop to 5½ percent—roughly in line with growth in nominal GDP—

reflecting the leveling off in the opportunity cost and the assumed return of more normal 

conditions in financial markets. 

(39) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to slow to an annual 

rate of around 4¾ percent on average over the forecast horizon, down notably from the 

growth of 8 percent in 2007.  In the household sector, falling house prices and weak 

residential investment continue to dampen mortgage borrowing over the forecast horizon.  

Consumer credit is also projected to slow notably, reflecting weak household spending on 

durable goods and tighter standards and terms on consumer loans.  With M&A and share 

repurchase activity diminishing significantly, business borrowing is expected to slow 

sharply.  State and local borrowing throttles back, reflecting the anticipated drop in 

issuance for both long-term capital projects and advance refundings; in addition, the 

ongoing difficulties of major bond insurers are expected to restrain municipal bond 

issuance somewhat this year.  The projected widening of the unified budget deficit—

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

 

 

  

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output 
to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the 
output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in 
seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in 
the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an 
estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and 
realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the inflation rate is computed 
using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential 
output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an estimated 
aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged 
values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output gap, 
the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and the real 
bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric model 
of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of which take 
the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run off 
this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap. 

TIPS-based Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the 
future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The TIPS-based 
measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous 
real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward 
rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor 
arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  
Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also adjusted for the 
medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis points—between total CPI inflation and core 
PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation two and 
three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead ( y *t − yt  and 
y *t t+1| − t 1|y + t ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential 

(Δ − *t t3| t 3|
4 4y y+ +Δ t ), and π *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-

based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification 
was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, 
specified as a sequence of  25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules 
were proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule with a higher value of r*.  
The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; 
see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted line 
labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to the previous Greenbook 
projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from 
the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate agreements, and the 
confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections 
for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled 
“Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current 
quarter.
